“We do not think India can stop Russian crude purchases overnight, even if it has agreed to do so, as at least 700,000 bpd of India imports of Russian crude are on a term basis,” consultancy FGE said in a note.
China could pick up some of the volumes backed out of India as Russian crude discounts will widen further, they added.
“The move has undoubtedly sounded an alarm for other Russian oil buyers who may have previously overlooked sanctions from non-U.S. authorities,” Xu said.
Anne-Sophie Corbeau, a researcher at Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy, said the U.S. needs to have a consistent and coherent policy on Russian LNG.","The moves come after Russia ramped up crude exports this month as Ukrainian drone attacks on its refineries have reduced oil processing. China and India’s seaborne imports of key Russian crude grades are expected to rebound to about 3.1 million barrels per day in October, the highest volume since June, data from analytics firm Kpler showed.

These imports are expected to remain high through November given the sharp rise in exports from Russia, Kpler’s senior oil analyst Muyu Xu said.

“However, the sudden UK sanctions on Chinese and Indian refineries — and the possibility of more measures from the EU or even the U.S. — could prompt buyers to take a more cautious approach when placing new orders until further clarification emerges,” she added.

INDIA CUTS NOT YET VISIBLE

A White House official said on Thursday that Indian refiners are already cutting Russian oil imports by 50%. Indian sources said the cut was not visible yet, though it could be reflected in import numbers for December or January. Refiners had already placed orders for November loading that included some cargoes for December arrival as well, multiple sources said.

“We do not think India can stop Russian crude purchases overnight, even if it has agreed to do so, as at least 700,000 bpd of India imports of Russian crude are on a term basis,” consultancy FGE said in a note.

“Therefore, the maximum volume of Russian crude flows to India we see as potentially being at risk in the short term is the 0.8-1 million bpd of spot volumes that Indian refiners take,” FGE analysts said. China could pick up some of the volumes backed out of India as Russian crude discounts will widen further, they added.

Meanwhile, Indian refiners have bought rare Guyanese crude as they diversify purchases that would mitigate the impact on their operations if Russian supply was cut.

SANCTIONS ON NAYARA, YULONG

Britain slapped sanctions on India’s Nayara refinery, which is already reeling from EU sanctions, and on Chinese refiner Yulong Petrochemical which operates a 400,000 barrels per day refinery in China’s eastern Shandong province.

The UK government has given Yulong until November 13 to complete outstanding transactions, allowing the refiner to handle its upcoming Middle Eastern imports, Kpler’s Xu said.

It’s unclear if Yulong can establish a new supply chain to circumvent the sanctions, she added.

“The move has undoubtedly sounded an alarm for other Russian oil buyers who may have previously overlooked sanctions from non-U.S. authorities,” Xu said.

June Goh, a senior oil market analyst at Sparta Commodities, said the UK sanctions are unlikely to significantly impact Yulong, but the refiner will find it hard to maintain operations if the EU and the U.S. follow suit.

Meanwhile, Taiwan’s Russian naphtha imports are set to fall after a group of non-governmental organisations criticised the island’s continued business with Russia.

However, Ukrainian attacks on Russian energy infrastructure, as well as a partial ban imposed by Moscow on Russian exports of gasoline and diesel, have already been capping Russian refined product shipments, traders said.

JAPAN LNG IMPORTS

The U.S. has also called on Japan to halt Russian energy imports, ahead of U.S. President Donald Trump’s expected visit to Asia later this month.

Tokyo has agreed with other G7 countries to phase out Russian oil imports in response to Moscow’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, but it has exemptions to continue importing LNG from the Sakhalin-2 project under long-term contracts.

An early termination of these contracts would result in various penalties, said Yuriy Humber, CEO of Tokyo-based consultancy Yuri Group. Also, securing an additional 6 million metric tons of LNG annually on the spot market to replace Russian supply would not be easy and is “massively expensive”, he said.

Russian LNG, which accounts for about 9% of Japanese imports, is an important stable supply source for Japan, Kingo Hayashi, chairman of Japan’s Federation of Electric Power Companies, told reporters on Friday, adding that Japanese utilities want to continue using it.

Anne-Sophie Corbeau, a researcher at Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy, said the U.S. needs to have a consistent and coherent policy on Russian LNG.

“On the one side, they are pressuring their allies to stop importing Russian gas or LNG. But they are not implementing their own sanctions on Arctic LNG 2,” she said, referring to Russia’s large-scale LNG project in northern Siberia which is still delivering LNG to China despite being under U.S. sanctions.

Asked about the cancellation of $7.5 billion in clean energy projects, Curtis said, “I have concerns.”

He said he’s not familiar with each project, “but I’ll come back to this: We need every electron we can get.”

Over a video feed on Friday, U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright also addressed the canceled projects in a speech to attendees of the climate summit.

“A lot of the stopping of funding of projects we’re working on right now have really been mutual decisions with the original applicants for them, that I think were counting on government support to continue on, you know, subsidized purchases of things that didn’t, that wouldn’t exist without subsidies,” Wright said. “We need things that will fly on their own.”

The National Resources Defense Council has said the projects were “crucial” for manufacturing and grid upgrades, and ending support for them will stall American innovation and competitiveness, raising costs for consumers, and further cementing our reliance on dirty fossil fuels.”

Some Republicans in Congress have shifted away from focusing on climate change, but Curtis said he’s still winning over support from those in his party who attend the yearly event.

“Some of them come, and they fold their arms like that, and they’re very suspicious. And then by the end of the day, they go, ‘I get it’,’” he said, “and they realize that it’s been a mistake for Republicans to not be engaged, because we do, we care deeply about the Earth.”

Curtis is sponsoring the bipartisan fire legislation along with Sens. Alex Padilla of California and John Hickenlooper of Colorado, both Democrats, and fellow Republican Tim Sheehy of Montana.

The wide-ranging bill would set up a Wildfire Intelligence Center, require evaluations of fireshed areas, and boost forest restoration funds, among other changes. Several environmental groups oppose the measure, saying it would open millions of acres of federal land to logging without allowing for scientific review or community input first.

In its fourth year, the event brought together representatives from the energy industry, government and environmental groups, with conversations focused on emerging technology,

“We’re really going to see nuclear move again. Nuclear is going to become sexy again” Wright said, speaking by a video feed at Utah Sen. John Curtis’ Conservative Climate Summit in Salt Lake City.

Wright said tech companies operating large-scale data centers known as hyperscalers to power AI “really want to see nuclear happen,” and noted they’re investing in advancing nuclear technology.

He said the country is making rapid progress in nuclear fusion, although experts have said the technology will not solve energy problems until the end of the decade or in the early 2030’s.

President Donald Trump has signed executive orders this year intended to bring about a “nuclear renaissance,” and Wright used the same phrase Friday.

“Utah absolutely is going to be a key part of that,” he said.

With nuclear projects coming to Utah, Cox hopes for rural jobs, but that’s no easy task

Utah Republicans, including Gov. Spencer Cox, share the desire to develop nuclear technology in the state, passing legislation creating governing bodies to advance nuclear systems, appropriating $10 million to fund Cox’s nuclear energy regulations through Operation Gigawatt, and making deals with nuclear innovators.

Cox has said he envisions the state as a home to dozens of small modular reactors. In the last six months, the state has signed an agreement with a company owned by Bill Gates to explore a Utah site for a new nuclear reactor and announced a partnership with another firm to bring an advanced reactor to Emery County.

Asked if the Emery County project will get off the ground, Curtis told reporters at his conference Friday, “I don’t think we have a choice of it being a reality, the demands for energy are so high, we have to figure this out.

Carmen Valdez, senior policy associate with HEAL Utah, said she has concerns about possible radiation exposure in communities near nuclear facilities, along with the years that could lapse between public investment and the day a reactor’s up and running.

“We are a little concerned about hearing ‘making nuclear sexy again,’ because there’s a lot of not great things that come with that industry that are just being brushed aside,” Valdez said.

Wright emphasized the plan to raise the nation’s energy output includes keeping coal-fired power plants running.

“I’m also super excited about next-generation geothermal, and frankly, Utah is the leader in that,” he said, referencing an enhanced geothermal plant being built in Beaver County.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-47642/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/wright.ames-8.14.1-2048x1536-1-1024x7681760750369.jpg?h=ddb1ad0c&itok=f8CjlLos,N,,2025-10-17 23:05:48.997229

IS: So the EPA actually canceled quite a few grants meant for Alaska Native villages and various Alaska communities that were related to the impacts of climate change.
(Bill) Walker was in office, he created a climate change commission, which again recommended preparing for potential flooding, like what we saw now.
Dunleavy disbanded that commission, and he really hasn't taken on sort of a similar flagship effort to try to address climate change.
Dunleavy this week about whether or not the impacts from the storm were related to climate change.","In the wake of the storm that devastated western Alaska this week, there's been scrutiny of the Trump administration's cancellation of a grant that had been aimed at preventing erosion in one of the hardest hit communities.

Under former President Joe Biden, the Environmental Protection Agency awarded the $20 million grant to the village of Kipnuk in December. But after Trump took office, his EPA canceled the grant, along with millions more meant for climate change mitigation and renewable energy projects.

As the Anchorage Daily News reports, the EPA defended that decision this week.

And while there are questions about whether the grant would've done much to help Kipnuk from the storm that hit Sunday, ADN reporter Iris Samuels says it was supposed to be used to build a protective barrier.

This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity.

Iris Samuels: So the village used to be several hundred feet away from the banks of the river, and over time it's gotten closer and closer and closer. So the goal of this grant was to create an erosion barrier, so that homes and village infrastructure that were at risk from the river eroding would be protected. That was the goal of the grant.

Casey Grove: Gotcha. So my understanding is it was canceled earlier this year. How was it canceled? And I guess, also, why was it canceled? Do we know?

IS: So the grant was awarded in December of 2024, and then Trump was elected, President Trump was elected. And in about March, this grant was frozen, and the EPA administrator basically said that they were reviewing all these grants that had to do with what they refer to as ""climate justice,"" and that potentially some of this funding would be reinstated after it went through this review process. But then in May the grant was formally canceled.

CG: And then, of course, this storm hits Kipnuk, Kwigillingok, other communities have been hit really hard by that, obviously. And folks started looking at this grant and the cancelation of this grant. You reached out to the EPA asking about that. What did they say?

IS: Right. So right from the very beginning, there was this awareness that there was, had been, this grant that was canceled. And we actually heard from Sen. Lisa Murkowski saying, essentially, something along the lines of, and this was back on Monday, really, the day after the storm had hit, that while this grant itself wouldn't have actually saved the damage that was inflicted on Kipnuk by this storm, because the construction wouldn't have been completed in time, what this storm really shows is the importance, broadly speaking, of this grant and grants like it, in protecting these types of communities.

So then I reached out to the EPA, and basically they said, ""It's a very good thing that we canceled this grant, because if we hadn't, then construction would have begun, and all the funding that had been awarded would be swept away in the Kuskokwim River,"" is what they said. So all we have is the written statement that the EPA provided from a spokesperson, so we kind of have to do some parsing of our own, but I think for the people of this community, this statement can come across as in a very, sort of, hurtful way, because reading between the lines, it essentially says, ""If there is a risk of this money being wasted, then why spend it at all?""

CG: So now, I mean, from the EPA's perspective, that money has been saved, it's in some account somewhere. Have they said anything about how that might be spent?

IS: So the EPA actually canceled quite a few grants meant for Alaska Native villages and various Alaska communities that were related to the impacts of climate change. And after they canceled hundreds of millions of dollars of grants meant for Alaska, what they did was they actually said, ""Now we're going to divert this money to the Denali Commission.""

And so, basically, this is $140 million that the EPA has said, ""Thanks to the fact that we canceled all these grants, we've now given $140 million to the Denali Commission."" But a lot of that money is already accounted for, for projects that don't have to do with, you know, erosion prevention and things like that. So it's really comparing apples to oranges in some cases.

CG: So we're talking about a $20 million grant specific to Kipnuk. But zooming out, the state has known for quite a while about the risks from this kind of a storm and these kind of impacts. Can you kind of walk me through that? It goes back quite a ways, right?

IS: Right, yeah, it goes back really two decades, and it's both the state and federal agencies that have been doing assessments for years, and kind of pointing to the fact that due to erosion, loss of sea ice, loss of permafrost, all of that is contributing or exacerbating the risks, environmental risks, for a lot of Alaska Native villages. And they've been pointing to potential flooding risks in many of these communities, again, for two decades.

Now we see this paper trail of report after report after report saying, ""We really need to be doing something about this."" And I think that what this storm really shows is, even though people have been saying we really need to be doing something, not enough has been done, and not just for the communities that were affected by this storm, but for quite a few other communities that may be at risk in future storms.

CG: Then, specifically talking about the administration of Gov. Mike Dunleavy, how did they respond to these risks?

IS: So we've seen actually a back and forth in administrations in Alaska for a few years. So actually it was former Gov. Sarah Palin who first created an entity in Alaska that was meant to address the impacts of climate change, and that was this kind of sub-cabinet that she had formed that created these recommendations. Among those recommendations were this idea that we need to prepare for potentially either mitigating erosion or potentially moving certain village sites that were at risk from flooding.

But then her successor (Gov. Sean Parnell) disbanded that sub-cabinet. Then, when former Gov. (Bill) Walker was in office, he created a climate change commission, which again recommended preparing for potential flooding, like what we saw now. And then Gov. Dunleavy disbanded that commission, and he really hasn't taken on sort of a similar flagship effort to try to address climate change.

We do see some of those efforts in some state agencies, so there are people within state government that really are tracking and working really, really hard on this, but without resources and sort of adequate attention, it's really, really difficult to make progress on this.

CG: You had asked Gov. Dunleavy this week about whether or not the impacts from the storm were related to climate change. What did he say about that?",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/15a9a7d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1536x806+0+173/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F0e%2F4f%2F6e76911c428d8e09b122f8d16e89%2F564608313-2068869747198937-3462339078743405247-n-2-crop.jpg,N,,2025-10-17 23:05:35.035284

For Detroiters thinking about upgrading to a more eco-friendly home or vehicle, it can be intimidating to invest in such a major purchase, especially with the high upfront costs of new appliances and installations. But high-energy costs are a challenge for Detroiters, with about 30% of residents facing a high-energy burden, meaning they spend more than 6% of their income on utilities. By upgrading to a more energy-efficient home or car, residents can drastically reduce these costs, freeing up income for other necessities and long-term goals.

Home upgrades lower energy costs, increasing property values. But, beyond the savings benefits, a greener community is a healthier community. Eco-friendly upgrades reduce carbon emissions for everyone. Replacing gas-powered vehicles with EVs and reducing reliance on fossil fuels for home energy leads to cleaner air, which is a significant factor in respiratory health, especially for vulnerable residents. Sustainable home improvements like insulation and energy-efficient HVAC systems don’t just save money; they create a more comfortable and healthier indoor environment. By embracing these changes, Detroiters can have a path toward a community that is economically resilient and a better place to live.

The Roadblocks to Going Green

The path to going green at home can feel intimidating. Here are some common concerns:

The Upfront Cost: Eco-friendly upgrades, from solar panel installation to a new electric vehicle, often come with significant initial price tags. The perception that “going green is expensive” is a major barrier, even when the long-term savings are substantial.

The “Red Tape” and Confusion: Navigating the world of government rebates, tax credits, and financing options can feel like a full-time job. Which programs apply to me? What forms do I need? Who can I trust to do the upgrade work? This complexity can lead to a state of “analysis paralysis,” with residents postponing action rather than facing the risk of making the wrong choice.

The Fear of the Unknown: Questions about new technologies are common. “Will my car’s EV’s battery last long enough for my commute?” “Do solar panels work on cloudy Michigan days?” “How do I find a reliable solar contractor?” These legitimate concerns, if left unanswered, can prevent people from moving forward.

The company said that newcleo plans to invest up to $2 billion via an affiliated investment vehicle. Oklo added that Blykalla, Sweden's advanced nuclear technology developer, is also considering co-investing in the same projects and procuring fuel-related services from the projects.

Oklo noted that the investments aim to span multiple projects under U.S. oversight, foster transatlantic cooperation that enhances energy security, and focus on creating a robust and resilient fuel ecosystem. The company added that specific projects and investment amounts will be detailed in forthcoming definitive agreements.

Under the One Big Beautiful Bill (BBB) introduced by U.S. President Donald, tax credits retained in the bill reduce investment risks for advanced nuclear reactors.

“This agreement to implement newcleo's advanced fuel expertise into Oklo's powerhouses and invest $2 billion into American infrastructure and advanced fuel solutions is yet another win for President Donald J. Trump's American Energy Dominance Agenda,” said Secretary of the Interior and Chairman of the National Energy Dominance Council Doug Burgum.

Retail sentiment on Oklo dipped to ‘extremely bearish’ from ‘bearish’ territory a day ago, with message volumes at ‘high’ levels, according to data from Stocktwits.

The company stated that the partnership enhances all parties' capacity to meet the increasing global demand for energy. This also includes co-investment into, and co-location of, fuel fabrication facilities and could include repurposing surplus plutonium in a manner consistent with established U.S. safety and security requirements.

“Fissioning surplus plutonium is the best way to eliminate a legacy liability while creating an abundant near-term fuel source. It can accelerate the deployment of multiple gigawatts of advanced reactors and serve as a bridge fuel until uranium enrichment and recycling scale up,” said Jacob DeWitte, co-founder and CEO of Oklo.

Shares of Oklo have gained 779% in the last 12 months.

“It plays a major role in transitioning many of these different recommendations for renewable energy integration to policies that are actionable.”","BUFFALO, N.Y. ­– Sayanti Mukherjee, PhD, assistant professor in the Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering at the University at Buffalo, knows that converting from fossil fuels to renewable energy takes more than just technical know-how. It also takes shifting social attitudes and garnering economic support.

Mukherjee and doctoral student Poulomee Roy highlighted all three of these critical requirements in their project, “Critical Need of the Hour for Renewable Energy Integration in the U.S.,” which won an American-Made Science Synthesis Prize sponsored by the U.S. Department of Energy’s Office of Electricity.

Their synthesis paper, “Roadmap for Renewable Integration in the U.S.: Navigating Challenges with Strategic Interventions and Risk-Informed Decision Making,” submitted as part of the project, was named one of eight winners out of 45 submissions from scientists in industry and academia across the world. It comes with a $10,000 cash prize.

“It’s an incredible honor,” Mukherjee says. “This award represents the culmination of teamwork, curiosity and the drive to find creative solutions to the renewable energy challenges of our time. I’m deeply thankful to the Department of Energy for recognizing our work.”

Launched in 2024, the Science Synthesis Prize challenges competitors to highlight pivotal opportunities, solutions and areas of investment to address the complications of integrating various energy sources with the electric grid.

“Our approach was exhaustive and holistic,” says Mukherjee, who also directs UB’s OASIS Laboratory and serves as an adjunct assistant professor of electrical engineering and an affiliate faculty member of the Institute for Artificial Intelligence and Data Science. “I think that’s what made our entry stand apart.”

Mukherjee and Roy conducted a systematic review of more than 300 studies conducted worldwide.

“For example, in Europe they are much more advanced in terms of renewable energies,” Mukherjee explains. “So, we reviewed a lot of case studies conducted by different universities and research institutes in Europe, and we found some success stories.”

The biggest takeaway, she says, is that most studies focus on just the technical part of converting to renewable energy, not the social or economic aspects.

“All three areas need attention,” she says. “But the majority of the attention is given to the technical side right now, especially in the U.S.”

For their paper, the two researchers examined the various facets of the challenges and opportunities associated with integrating renewable energy into the grid and then compared them with the current industry outlook.

“First, we analyzed how the various studies are contributing value to the current landscape,” she says. “Then, we’ve identified the gaps, analyzed what we can but are not doing currently, and finally, made suggestions on how we could improve the renewable energy integration process.”

She notes that the technical aspects present significant challenges that will need to be rectified, such as integrating new types of renewable energy into an aging existing grid and transmitting energy from offshore wind and solar plants to the communities that need them.

The social and economic challenges, however, are just as significant.

“Let’s look at the installation of solar panels,” she says. “There’s a huge upfront cost. While there are many clean energy programs where the government subsidizes some of the initial costs, many homeowners and businesses are either unaware of such programs or don’t understand the benefits that they might earn from installing solar panels. Over the next five to 10 years, they may receive significant benefits because of lower electricity bills, but what they see now is how much the panels cost to install.”

The study also recommends various investment strategies, including pooled investments and green bonds, which could help raise funds to cover such upfront costs.

If a community wants to install microgrids, for instance, they could get subsidies to power several homes in that community, Mukherjee says.

“Starting small from the ground level is very important for any type of new technology to flourish,” she says. “But first, you have to get acceptance from the communities.”

The problem is that many discussions on renewable energy integration overlook this crucial step — engaging communities and involving them throughout the decision-making process, from inception to implementation.

“What I’ve learned from other research studies that I’ve conducted is that when you involve the communities in the decision-making process, you’re more successful,” she says. “It plays a major role in transitioning many of these different recommendations for renewable energy integration to policies that are actionable.”",https://www.buffalo.edu/content/shared/university/news/news-center-releases/2025/10/Sayanti-Mukherjee-DOE-Award/_jcr_content/par/image.img.512.auto.jpg/1760721157663.jpg,N,,2025-10-17 22:00:36.685106

(NRDC) and data from Cox Automotive, EV prices have fallen by about $14,000 in the past year, making them only about $2,800 more expensive upfront than new gas cars. However, the availability of charging infrastructure can significantly impact cost savings.

reports that there are 104 gas pumps per 1,000 road miles compared to just 22 EV charging ports in the U.S. This disparity means that in areas with limited charging options or heavy reliance on fast chargers, the cost benefits of EVs may diminish.

Despite the higher initial cost, EVs offer long-term savings, particularly in fuel and maintenance. A analysis found that driving 100 miles in a typical gas car costs about $13, while charging an EV at home costs just $5 on average, resulting in more than 60% savings per ""fill up."" Additionally, EVs require less maintenance, with the NRDC reporting that EV maintenance is about 40% cheaper per mile compared to gas vehicles.

Government incentives for EVs are phasing out, but the NRDC-backed Atlas Public Policy study indicates that EVs remain cheaper in four out of five vehicle categories over time, excluding pickup trucks, where gas models are still more affordable.

Fueling costs favor EVs, especially in states with like Washington and Oregon. However, in states with expensive electricity, such as California and Connecticut, the cost advantage may shift towards gas vehicles, particularly if relying on public fast chargers.

Ultimately, EVs are generally cheaper to drive over time, but actual savings depend on factors such as location, vehicle type, charging options, and local electricity versus gas prices. As EV technology and affordability improve, potential buyers should evaluate their personal circumstances before making the switch.",https://wcti12.com/resources/media2/16x9/6000/986/0x313/90/5176e027-061a-4031-b8a4-52aa2ffc8975-GettyImages2240446866.jpg,N,,2025-10-17 22:00:52.921899

“These funds were going to help low-income and rural North Carolinians save money on their energy bills,” he said.
“Thousands of families were going to have the option to install solar power, save money, and have another energy option after a major storm.
“The bottom line is this: EPA no longer has the statutory authority to administer the program or the appropriated funds to keep this boondoggle alive.
The solar energy industry employs over 9,000 North Carolinians and supports more than 200 businesses across the state.","On Thursday, Attorney General Jeff Jackson joined 21 other states and the District of Columbia in suing the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for canceling the $7 billion Solar for All program.

Created in 2022 by the Inflation Reduction Act, the program was designed to provide funding to 60 grant recipients, with the goal of helping an estimated 900,000 low-income households across the country utilize solar power to reduce their energy costs.

Jackson said in a press release that the funds would have helped more than 12,000 households in North Carolina save an average of 20% on their utility bills and supported energy jobs.

“These funds were going to help low-income and rural North Carolinians save money on their energy bills,” he said. “Thousands of families were going to have the option to install solar power, save money, and have another energy option after a major storm. Now the EPA has illegally cancelled those funds — so I’m going to court to bring $150 million back to our state.”

In 2024, the EnergizeNC coalition, led by the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality (NCDEQ), applied for and was awarded a $156 million Solar for All grant from the EPA. According to Jackson’s press release, over five years, the program would have helped create at least 43 megawatts of solar energy and offered financial assistance to help low-income, single-family homes, multifamily housing, households with medical needs, and community solar pilot programs install rooftop solar.

The cancellation, Jackson said, left the state without more than $150 million of the $156 million it had been awarded, and the grants were “abruptly cancelled without a valid legal basis, and the attorneys general are suing to win back this money that is legally due to North Carolina and other states.”

On Aug. 7, the EPA canceled the program, which was included in the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund. Lee Zeldin, administrator for the EPA, discussed the cancellation, which resulted from the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act.”

“In some cases, your tax dollars were diluted through up to FOUR pass-through entities, each taking their own cut off the top!” he said in a post on X. “The bottom line is this: EPA no longer has the statutory authority to administer the program or the appropriated funds to keep this boondoggle alive. Today, the Trump EPA is announcing that we are ending Solar for All for good, saving US taxpayers ANOTHER $7 BILLION!”

NCDEQ Secretary Reid Wilson said in the release that the cancellation of the program would eliminate the installation of rooftop solar panels for more than 12,000 low-and medium-income families.

“Rooftop solar drives down utility bills, reduces air pollution, and creates jobs,” he said. “The program’s cancellation would hurt the electric grid’s ability to be resilient to future disasters, and would hamper North Carolina’s efforts to ensure reliable, clean, and affordable energy supplies to meet the needs of a rapidly growing population and rising energy demand.”

The funds, the release said, would also have helped households transition to more reliable sources of energy and prevent power outages caused by natural disasters, like Hurricane Helene.

Additionally, it stated that the Solar for All program was also designed to help create an additional 140 new local jobs, including those for contractors, construction workers, and maintenance staff. The solar energy industry employs over 9,000 North Carolinians and supports more than 200 businesses across the state.

Jon Sanders, director of the Center for Food, Power, and Life at the Jon Locke Foundation, told Carolina Journal that although Jackson’s statement that the Solar for All program would have saved low-income people and their families on their power bills and created jobs is true, there is no reason for the attorney general to think that the Solar for All program is the only, or even a good, way to lower power bills and create jobs.

“With respect to helping low-income families pay for getting solar panels installed on their houses, the program could do so only for those low-income families that have a house,” he told CJ. “Others in low-income apartments and multifamily housing would not be able to avail themselves of any putative benefits. Also, the jobs he is talking about would be contract installation jobs chasing subsidized work, not full-time jobs from an expanding economy.”

Sanders said the economic research literature is filled with studies demonstrating that faster job growth happens in economies with less regulation, lower tax burdens, and greater protection of individual rights against the government.

“I would welcome a North Carolina attorney general adopting those goals for his vision of the state,” he said.

Sanders added that, given that electricity is a vital expense for all households and an input cost for every business in the state, resource decisions that result in lower power bills would lead to a stronger economy and more job creation than otherwise.",https://www.carolinajournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/solar-panels-943999_1280.jpg,N,,2025-10-17 23:59:37.887561

A Proclamation

From the Appalachian Mountains to the Mississippi River to the Great Plains and beyond, for nearly 250 years, America has been endlessly sustained and enriched by our abundance of precious natural resources like oil, clean coal, minerals, and natural gas. This National Energy Dominance Month, my Administration proudly recommits to harnessing the liquid gold and minerals under our feet and bountiful resources in our waters, forests, and fields, achieving American energy dominance, and forging a future defined by three simple words: “Drill, baby, drill.”

During my first term in office, America became the number one producer of oil and natural gas in the world and the coal industry was coming back — after eight hard years of Obama’s War on Coal. Tragically, after the conclusion of my first term, the previous administration launched a war on American energy — reversing all of my historic first term actions, leading all 50 States to hit record-high gas prices. Meanwhile, the Green New Scam shuttered dozens of coal plants leaving our power grid vulnerable, halted mining productions, and shipped our energy jobs from Texas to Tehran, from the Midwest to Moscow, and from Baton Rouge to Beijing. As I have stated many times before, energy security is national security. My predecessor outrageously depleted our Strategic Petroleum Reserve — emboldening our enemies and making us reliant on foreign nations while subjecting the American people to sky-high energy prices here at home.

This period of national self-destruction ended on January 20, 2025. As the 47th President of the United States, my energy policy is defined by maximum production, maximum prosperity, and maximum power. On my first day in office, I declared a National Energy Emergency to lower escalating energy prices. I signed an Executive Order to unleash American energy, which rolled back energy restrictions imposed by the previous administration. I established the National Energy Dominance Council to ensure the American energy industry maintains its global leadership in the decades to come. I also took action to revive America’s dominance in offshore critical minerals and resources, lift burdensome regulations on coal plants to ensure they can continue to run, launch the nuclear energy renaissance, and open up the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska, one of the largest drilling sites in the world. Every day, we are making good on our promise to restore the United States as a global energy superpower — and our work has only just begun. Now, under my Administration, our workers are drilling, mining, and producing like never before.

This month, we continue our crusade to bring back American energy dominance, uplift the American worker, protect the American industry, cherish American resources, and make America the most prosperous country on the face of the Earth.

NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 2025 as National Energy Dominance Month.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this

In light of the growing demand for electricity from data centers and artificial intelligence infrastructure, the initiative seeks to increase grid capacity and reliability.

With 5.6 million customers in 11 states, American Electric Power is one of the biggest utilities in the country. Its main energy sources are coal, natural gas, and nuclear power, with a small amount coming from renewable sources.

The project will guarantee ""affordable, reliable, and secure energy for decades,"" according to Energy Secretary Chris Wright, who emphasized the administration's emphasis on increasing conventional energy production and modernizing the grid.

The loan is the first of its kind authorized by the Trump administration and is made available through the new Energy Dominance Financing program.

In light of the recent cancellation of $7.6 billion in renewable energy grants across 16 states, Wright characterized it as an attempt to undo the clean energy agenda of the previous administration.

There will be a smaller portion in West Virginia, but more than 2,000 miles of lines will be replaced in Ohio, 1,400 miles in Indiana and Michigan, and another 1,400 miles in Oklahoma.

An estimated 1,100 construction jobs will be created by the project. According to AEP CEO Bill Fehrman, the improvements will boost regional economic growth, lower costs, and increase reliability.

What’s The Punctum Of The 2025 Hyundai Elantra Hybrid?","New cars are way too freaking expensive. Sure, they have more showroom appeal than ever before, but a lot of people who could spend about $30,000 on a new car ten years ago can still only spend about $30,000 on a new car. At the same time, fuel’s become more expensive, and the number of cars out there for less than 30,000 greenbacks is smaller than ever before. Thank goodness the Hyundai Elantra Hybrid still exists.

This isn’t the first time we’ve been behind the wheel of Hyundai’s electrified compact sedan, but a lot has changed since 2023. Not only did the Elantra get a facelift, the whole new car market has grown even more wild. Just last month, the average price of a new car in America crossed the $50,000 barrier, and while part of that was due to a rush on EVs before federal tax credits ended, it still means we’re living in a world where a four-figure car payment is increasingly normalized. So what can you still get for less than half that? An excellent daily driver, as it turns out.

[Full disclosure: Hyundai Canada brought this Elantra Hybrid to AJAC TestFest, where I was finally able to take it out for a proper evaluation.]

Why Does It Exist?

In case you haven’t looked at the new car market in a decade, hybrids are hotter than those glowing metal balls you see while doomscrolling, so it simply makes sense that Hyundai builds an Elantra Hybrid to do battle against the Toyota Corolla Hybrid and the Honda Civic Hybrid. When it comes to reasonably priced fuel-sippers, this is one of the big three.

How Does It Look?

You know how baby pangolins always look like they’re about to sheepishly deliver some mildly sad but not day-ruining news? I know we humans are prone to anthropomorphizing everything under the sun, but I swear there’s a hint of endangered scaly anteater to the look of the Elantra. Maybe it’s the interplay of the bulbous silhouette with the angular character lines, maybe it’s exacerbated by the diamond pattern in the C-pillar filler panels, but like the strange-looking animal, this is one strange-looking car. Still, sometimes good things come in strange-looking packages.

What About The Interior?

Maybe it’s just me, but as the average car continues to grow more expensive, I’m warming up to the cabin of Hyundai’s value sedan. Alright, I wouldn’t trust the console grab handle to withstand much more than the weight of a chicken shawarma platter, but apart from that, nothing inside the Elantra feels flimsy or egregiously cheap. Some of it’s properly nice, like real metal trim and available denim-like cloth on the door cards. The only real complaint I have when it comes to usability is the metal trim on the steering wheel. It’s right where the edge of your palms rest with your hands at nine-and-three, and it gets frigid when the mercury hits the zone that tells you who’s wearing too thin a shirt.

Besides, the big story here is space and comfort. It’s no secret the Elantra is big-boned for a compact, but that just means you can get three real adults in the rear seat, and all of their luggage for a weekend away fits in the 14.2 cu.-ft. trunk. Of course, the best seats in the house are still up front, with a surprising amount of support for compact car thrones. We’re talking cushions that don’t seem like topographical maps of Kansas and instead actually feel designed for real human beings, a good reason to consider the Elantra Hybrid over the Corolla Hybrid. I do wish the tilt-and-telescoping steering column telescoped further towards the driver, but the overall driving position is perfectly comfortable for someone of average height.

How Does It Drive?

Of course, if you’re considering making a Hyundai Elantra Hybrid your next daily driver, it’s probably not simply due to its spaciousness and out-there looks. After all, you can get those in a regular non-hybrid model, but the hybrid powertrain really is something special beyond its headline fuel economy figures.

On paper, it may only pump out 132 horsepower, but 195 lb.-ft. of combined torque mean that off the mark and when changing lanes, the Elantra Hybrid always feels perfectly quick enough. What’s more, because this sedan uses a six-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission instead of a CVT, you aren’t forced to listen to an atonal wall of sound should you need to put the skinny pedal to the carpet. Score. Of course, this test car has the big wheels that knock fuel economy down a touch, but it still returned an honest 51 MPG with journalists treating the throttle pedal like a stompbox all day.

Even though the Elantra Hybrid gets multilink rear suspension, don’t expect it to feel like a sport compact car with hybrid efficiency. This thing leans firmly toward comfort, because most people just want a smooth ride home after eight hours in the cubicle. It turns out that all the fuss Hyundai made about structural adhesives means the comfy suspension can actually do its job, so this compact sedan glides over bumps with the grace of a midsizer. See, the operative word here is “natural.”

The steering weighs up like you’d expect steering to. The brake pedal feels normal, almost like it doesn’t have to blend regenerative braking from the electric motor with hydraulic braking from the, um, brakes. Even the shifter’s normal, so you could give the Elantra Hybrid to someone who’s been driving a 2006 Civic for the past two decades, and nothing will seem weird to them. Fantastic.

Does It Have The Electronic Crap I Want?

Sort-of. All the gadgetry inside the Elantra Hybrid feels a bit five years ago, but in ways that aren’t exactly a letdown. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto only work over a wired USB-A connection, but Hyundai’s previous-generation infotainment system is still reasonably slick, with logical menus and plenty of physical controls. The digital gauge cluster might not show you what song’s currently playing, but you can set it to this fun cube-themed skin that delivers a bong hit of when-the-internet-was-fun nostalgia directly into your hippocampus.

This fully-loaded trim gets a moonroof, dual-zone climate control, wireless smartphone charging, GPS navigation, heated seats, a heated steering wheel, an eight-speaker Bose sound system that isn’t too shabby considering the segment, and ambient lighting, all for a shade over $31,000. That’s a lot of kit for the money.

Three Things To Know About The 2025 Hyundai Elantra Hybrid:

Diesel-like torque means it doesn’t feel slow.

It uses a subdivided section of its hybrid battery pack to power its 12-volt electrics, so you’ll never have to buy a replacement lead-acid battery for it.

You can get one loaded to the gills with toys for about the same price as the cheapest Civic Hybrid.

Does It Fulfill Its Purpose?

Absolutely. The Hyundai Elantra Hybrid is a lot of good, economical car for the sort of money normal people can actually justify. Whether you’re looking at the $26,695 Elantra Hybrid Blue or the $31,045 Elantra Hybrid Limited, it feels like your money’s going far. While a comparably equipped Honda Civic Hybrid is quicker and more premium-feeling, it’s also thousands of dollars more expensive. At the same time, a Corolla Hybrid doesn’t feel much nicer than the Elantra Hybrid, is a whole lot slower, isn’t as comfortable, and costs about the same as the Hyundai. Even though Toyota has a rock-solid hybrid system, you still have to sit in that driver’s seat every day, so the Elantra Hybrid gets my vote hands-down.

Believe it or not, the Elantra Hybrid is an even better deal in Canada, where its single loaded trim level undercuts the cheapest Civic Hybrid by several thousand loonies, and works out about even with a mid-range Corolla Hybrid on price while offering a handful of features unavailable on the Toyota.

What’s The Punctum Of The 2025 Hyundai Elantra Hybrid?

With loads of toys, a great price, proper hybrid fuel economy, and solid comfort, welcome to the happy medium of the hybrid compact sedan market.

In September, the House passed resolutions under the Congressional Review Act (CRA)—a little-known 1996 law that Congress enacted to overturn certain federal agency actions through a special review process—to roll back three resource management plans (RMPs) for managing public lands under the BLM for Montana, Alaska and North Dakota. Those plans collectively guide decisions on over 166 million acres, shaping oil and gas leasing, renewable energy, grazing and habitat protections. The Senate voted to approve all three rollbacks on Oct. 8 and 9.

‎While there are no BLM managed public lands in any Midwest states, those who track public land policy warned that if the CRA applies to BLM, for example, it could potentially also apply to U.S. Forest Service (USFS), the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and National Park Service plans. Those agencies oversee lands in Midwest, Southern and East Coast states.

“It would translate into potentially reviewing plans by the Forest Service as well as the Fish and Wildlife Service for the management of national wildlife refuges, as well as the National Park Service,” said Sam Kalen, McKinney Family Chair in Environmental Law at Indiana University McKinney School of Law. Kalen joined 30 other legal experts in signing an open letter opposing the resolutions last month.

“What you would see next is an effort to try to mirror what’s happening in the West to park lands, or wildlife lands, or forest lands…,” he said. “What we’re seeing is an effort by some in Congress, as well as potentially maybe some in the administration, to try to adversely affect how we’re going to be managing and protecting our resources in the future.”

Invoking the CRA in this manner would give Congress the final word on documents that have historically been crafted through years of federally mandated public comment, tribal and stakeholder consultation, on-the-ground land manager input and environmental review intended to balance multiple uses, such as grazing, energy development, recreation and conservation.

If the CRA application broadens as experts fear it will, every time a new plan is developed to determine the management objectives and activities allowed on those lands in the future, the agency will have to submit the plan changes to Congress.

Kalen gave the example of the BLM plan to end coal leasing in the Powder River Basin in Wyoming. “If you want to change the plan to allow coal leasing, what that would mean is you would go develop a new plan, and you’d have to submit that to Congress with a potential CRA possibility,” Kalen said. “What I think some of the Republicans want to do is be able to take a look at the plans issued under the Biden administration, such as the plan that effectively shut down coal leasing, and be able to overturn that plan.”

If an agency such as the USFS wanted to change an existing plan for activities that occur on public lands, the plan would be subject to congressional disapproval. This hasn’t been done in the past, and “it’s going to create a nightmare and considerable uncertainty for all affected parties if the agencies have to wait and see what happens in Congress under the CRA every time they change or amend their plans,” Kalen said.

This is worrisome, he said, because of the CRA’s “substantially similar” clause, which prohibits agencies from issuing new rules that are too much like those Congress has rejected using the act. However, the term is poorly defined, so plans could be struck down without explanation, making it more difficult for agencies to draft a new one.

If an agency goes through the process for developing a plan, including gathering public input and working on the plan for over a year and the plan gets thrown out, that agency has also wasted time, resources and expertise. This could deter them from developing new plans, he explained.

The CRA was intended to be used to overturn recently enacted federal regulations. Kalen speculated that Republicans’ objective is to more easily overturn plans passed during the Biden administration, as this is not the first time the Trump administration has used it. For example, Trump rescinded Obama-era methane rules, along with about 100 other environmental regulations, during his first term. But within months of Biden’s election, the Democratic-controlled Congress rescinded Trump’s rescission of the methane rules; it was one of three Trump actions lawmakers killed using the CRA.

Another expert who also signed the open letter explained that since BLM manages public lands under the Federal Land Policy and Management Act, invoking the CRA in this context could have long-term implications for management plans on other statutes.

“If Congress is successful in using the CRA to overturn a BLM resource management plan, they could then use the same principles to overturn other federal agencies’ planning documents,” said Alexandra Klass, a law professor at the University of Michigan Law School who also served as the deputy general counsel for energy efficiency and clean energy demonstrations at the Department of Energy from April 2022 to July 2023. “I don’t think it’s an appropriate use of the CRA for any of them, but it’d be the same idea.”

Klass added that although agencies like the USFS have their own planning processes under their respective enabling statutes, if Congress is able to invoke the CRA for BLM plans, “they could do it for the department of the Forest Service’s equivalent.”

“In theory, if they are successful in using the CRA to get rid of a resource management plan, they could do that anywhere,” she added, but specified that experts’ main concerns are currently about Western plans. Many land use plans in Midwest states, she explained, are decades old and less likely to be targeted than Biden-era plans in Western states.

Long term, Klass said that requiring plans to be approved by Congress could result in BLM lands that are not protective of the environment, as “it takes away some of the tools that the agency has to guide land use.” For example, BLM has a multiple-use mandate that requires an RMP to balance recreation, industry and environmental protection, setting priorities for different types of lands that have various features and resources.

“By taking those away you could have uncertainty for different types of activities,” Klass said, “and you also have much less ability to restrict certain types of development that can harm other uses of federal lands.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2240765539-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-10-17 19:03:23.267843

Sen. Curtis has earned a reputation as one of the few Republican political leaders to talk about climate change. He brings together people from all sides at the Conservative Climate Summit to talk about environmental issues and try to find solutions.

On Friday at the University of Utah, there were discussions about water demands, renewable energy sources, land issues and nuclear power.

The board’s approval of the rezoning conditions is nonbinding but indicates a favorable recommendation of the proposal to the Apex Town Council based on environmental impacts when the council considers the rezoning, if the conditions are met.
“We’re trying to work in a collaborative way with the town, with the community,” Natelli says.
Still, the impacts of emerging data storage facilities, used to power technology and increasingly powerful AI, are being felt across the country.
But the Town of Apex has its own local distribution and transmission rates.","At the heart of the debate over whether Apex should annex and rezone a parcel of land located in New Hill just south of Old U.S. Highway 1 for a proposed data storage facility is a central question: Do town leaders envision that property as a corridor for future industrial growth, or do they want it to remain rural pastureland?

If it’s the former, developer Michael Natelli argues, his company’s proposed New Hill Digital Campus is an ideal use for the site; if it’s the latter, he says, his business here is done.

The town’s long-range planning documents, including its Comprehensive Plan, have identified the site for industrial use for at least the past decade, but it is currently zoned for low-density residential.

On Thursday evening, the Town of Apex’s Environmental Advisory Board (EAB), working on the assumption that Apex leaders are still planning for that industrial use, voted 6–3 to side with Natelli after his company, Natelli Investments, LLC, submitted rezoning conditions aimed at addressing the environmental impacts of the project, including sound pollution, water and electricity usage, and the presence of diesel-fueled generators proposed for the site.

The board is composed of volunteers with expertise in conservation, environmental engineering, land use, and related areas. The board’s approval of the rezoning conditions is nonbinding but indicates a favorable recommendation of the proposal to the Apex Town Council based on environmental impacts when the council considers the rezoning, if the conditions are met. The town’s planning board will weigh in on the land use, and the town council will ultimately decide whether to grant the rezoning to industrial use. Continued opposition from residents is expected.

In an interview ahead of the board meeting earlier this week, Natelli told the INDY that he recognizes the proposal would be a major change for the area, but if the town is going to stick with its plan for an industrial use for the site, a data storage facility would be less disruptive than a manufacturing plant, recycling facility, or distribution warehouse, for example. He says the company will go beyond basic requirements for buffers, setbacks, and vegetation to minimize light and noise pollution, and at the board meeting, he committed to regular sound testing and monitoring.

“We’re trying to work in a collaborative way with the town, with the community,” Natelli says.

Still, the impacts of emerging data storage facilities, used to power technology and increasingly powerful AI, are being felt across the country. Large facilities like this one use staggering amounts of electricity and in some cases water, and for many Americans living close to them, the quality-of-life issues are real.

“As a founding member of this board, I don’t think there could possibly be enough zoning conditions to mitigate the negative effects of this proposal,” said EAB member Katie Schaaf, one of the dissenting voters, at Thursday’s meeting.

Natelli acknowledges that there is a lot of negative media coverage about data centers, much of it “rightly so, because there are a lot of projects that, for one reason or another, should be scrutinized for certain reasons.”

But he disagrees with the premise that data centers “are bad all the time.”

“Certain areas like this, I feel, are very compelling for data centers,” he says. “Other areas are not. If we can start looking at things on a project-by-project basis … I do think we can find a way to mitigate a lot of the concerns that are out there, if people are willing to have an open mind about it.”

Here’s a look at the plans for the facility so far, some of the environmental issues under discussion, the community’s concerns, and how the developer has proposed to address those concerns in the rezoning conditions.

Electricity usage

There’s no getting around it—data centers are power intensive, and this one especially so with a request for 300 megawatts from Duke Energy (for context, that’s about a third of the total energy output of the nearby Shearon Harris nuclear plant).

Natelli Investments submitted a load study to Duke Energy this spring, and Natelli says the company “feels comfortable” asking for that much power. Transmission lines already exist that could link the property to Shearon Harris, and the developer would pay for any infrastructure upgrades needed.

But residents worry that the massive electricity usage would cause their power bills to surge.

Natelli says the facility wouldn’t be taking power directly or exclusively from Shearon Harris but from several different power plants that serve Duke Energy’s grid, and the utility would figure out how to supply the 300 megawatts incrementally.

“Duke [Energy] … is evaluating the ability for them to serve our requested load, as well as what impacts that load might have on the transmission system, and any upgrades required to the transmission system—the extension of power, the substation, switching stations—we have to bear the cost of all that,” Natelli says. “It’s a very, very big commitment, but it’s a commitment that we’re making, and we’re not pushing that cost … on to other people in Apex.”

But a recent report from Bloomberg found that wholesale electricity costs up to 267 percent more than it did five years ago in areas located near data centers, especially in Northern Virginia and Maryland (where Natelli Investments is based), where data centers are highly concentrated.

“It’s an increasingly dramatic ripple effect of the AI boom as energy-hungry data centers send power costs to records in much of the US, pulling everyday households into paying for the digital economy,” the report states.

In North Carolina, as Duke Energy evaluates its capacity to provide power for data centers planned statewide, there’s a possibility that the state’s Utilities Commission will have to raise rates on all consumers. But the Town of Apex has its own local distribution and transmission rates.

“And we’re not touching that,” Natelli says. “There’s nothing we’re doing that’s going to influence the retail rates that [the town] is charging Apex residents.”

Water usage

Part of the draw of the New Hill site is its proximity to the Western Wake Regional Water Reclamation Facility, a wastewater treatment plant jointly owned by the towns of Apex and Cary that’s situated just a few hundred feet from the property.

With the plant, an 18 million–gallon-per-day facility with a reclaimed water system already on-site, a prospective client would have the option to use nonpotable treated wastewater —between 0.5 million and 1.5 million gallons per day—for cooling inside the data storage facility.

It’s likely the water would only be used for cooling during the hottest months, representatives for Natelli told the EAB, and the new facility could provide on-site storage for the treated wastewater in the case of an emergency.

It’s also likely that an end user for the site wouldn’t require water at all, as some companies have shifted to using air or fluid cooling systems for their equipment.

“A lot of users are moving away from using water altogether,” said Kraig Walsleben, a consultant for Natelli Investments.

If the site does end up using wastewater, about a third of the water used would evaporate during the cooling process.

“We would have to evaluate ecological impacts,” Walsleben said.

Diesel generators

Natelli’s proposal calls for 80 three-megawatt backup generators to be located on the site. Each would be housed inside a tractor-trailer-sized storage container, with a diesel fuel tank stored underneath.

The diesel generators have been a source of anxiety for residents. Burning diesel, a fossil fuel, releases nitrogen oxide, sulfur oxide, carbon monoxide, and particulate matter into the atmosphere.

“Air pollutants are silent killers,” said Michelle O’Connor, a resident of the neighboring Jordan Pointe community, at Apex’s regularly scheduled town council meeting this week. “These particulates are a unique threat as they not only are capable of penetrating lung and olfactory tissues but are small enough to cross the blood-brain barrier. There is no exposure level that is considered safe, just levels that are considered acceptable.”

In their zoning conditions, Natelli pledges to use Tier 4–equivalent generators, which are designed to meet the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s strictest emission standards. They are the most energy efficient and have particulate filters and internal processes to treat emissions, Natelli says.

The generators would all need to be permitted to meet standards set by the EPA and the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality, and they would be used rarely. The facility would be running on higher-voltage-transmission power lines rather than regular residential distribution lines, Walsleben explained, and transmission power lines are less impacted by weather or other emergencies that tend to knock out power.

Noise pollution

For a few of the EAB members, and for some members of the community, concerns over noise associated with the generators, cooling equipment, and other aspects of the data storage facility are some of the most pressing.

Natelli Investments has sought to address potential noise impacts in its rezoning conditions in several ways.

First of all, the company wants to work with the Town of Apex to create a more robust noise ordinance that will provide an objective way to measure noise output and make sure the facility is in compliance.

In addition to doing its own sound evaluations, the company committed at the board meeting to paying for an independent consultant hired by the town to work on sound attenuation and testing measures. Increased setbacks, the company’s representatives said, will also help, as will buffers with vegetation.

“We’re going to implement design measures like berming and landscaping and noise fencing if required,” Natelli told the INDY. “There are attenuation measures that can be built around the equipment. We’re fully committed to doing whatever we need to to ensure that the sound isn’t causing a problem, and it’s at levels that are deemed acceptable.”

He adds that at the property line, the noise could, at 55 or 60 decibels, sound like a normal conversation. The company plans to study how the sound travels to nearby neighborhoods like Jordan Pointe.

“It’ll hopefully put a number of people at ease,” Natelli says.

While the residents in attendance vocally disagreed, it did seem to put the majority of the EAB members at ease. Board member Bill Jensen said the digital campus could provide an opportunity for more Apex residents to work where they live rather than commuting to Raleigh or elsewhere.

“I’ll be frank, I think this property is a decent area for light industrial,” said Jensen before making a motion to approve the rezoning conditions. “‘I’m sorry, I know that’s probably going against the grain, but if you do these things right, and you make a live-work situation, then everybody can benefit. And that’s the critical thing, and that’s what we’re trying to do, is make this thing right.”",https://indyweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025-10-16-apex-data-center-eniviro-illo-npm-v3.jpg,N,,2025-10-17 19:03:31.954683

“That is absolutely ridiculous.” Gordon said the federal government and states need to get out of their own way, specifically with permitting new energy projects.
The current Trump administration has promised to bring it back with the attitude of “mine, baby, mine.” However, two recently scheduled federal coal lease sales in the region were a flop.","Republican governors discussed their plan for “Unleashing American Energy” at a recent Montana economic conference.

The panel, which included Wyoming’s Gov. Mark Gordon, Montana’s Gov. Greg Gianforte, Nebraska’s Gov. Jim Pillen and Gov. Puerto Rico’s Jennifer González-Colón, cheered on Pres. Trump’s executive orders that are rolling back federal oversight of industry.

“It's a new day in Washington with President Trump,” said Gianforte, who led the speakers.

The governors highlighted Trump’s efforts to fast track energy projects. For example, some review times on federal environmental assessments have been reduced from one year to 14 days, and for environmental impact statements, it’s truncated from two years to 28 days. This is part of the administration’s dismantling of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). It’s a 55-year-old federal act, often thought of as the Magna Carta of environmental policy, that requires federal agencies to consider and assess environmental impacts of a project.

Gordon also cheered the move to streamline the process. He brought up Wyoming’s TerraPower project, which will be a first of its kind nuclear power plant. The project was announced in 2020.

“It took, let me see, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, independent NEPA analyses between the NRC (Nuclear Regulatory Commission), the EPA (Environmental Protection Agency), and the Bureau of Land Management (BLM),” Gordon said. “That is absolutely ridiculous.”

Gordon said the federal government and states need to get out of their own way, specifically with permitting new energy projects.

“You can regulate by saying, ‘Here's what we would like you to do. However you get there, do it.’ That's cool. That's America,” Gordon said.

Nebraska’s Gov. Pillen said more can be done to get energy projects off the ground. He called for ending the federal permitting process for energy industries, which includes NEPA, citing a Nebraska transmission line project that’s been in limbo for more than a decade.

“We got people that are just continuing to create more roadblocks and roadblocks. We have to end the permitting,” Pillen said. “We gotta steamroll the permitting process.”

However, many conservation groups are raising red flags with Trump’s rollback of NEPA. Earthjustice said NEPA is key for government transparency and accountability, and that actions to dismantle it “fundamentally undermine the public’s ability to participate in federal decision-making processes.”

The governors also discussed the coal market, with an eye toward Montana and Wyoming. The states are home to the Powder River Basin, which is the top producing coal region in the country. The coal market has declined for more than 15 years, even during the first Trump administration. The current Trump administration has promised to bring it back with the attitude of “mine, baby, mine.” However, two recently scheduled federal coal lease sales in the region were a flop.

“We need to get coal leasing out there, and coal companies need to bid more than it costs for a new haul truck for those leases,” said Gordon.

The Montana sale was the first federal sale in the Powder River Basin in more than a decade. But the top bid was for less than a penny per ton. The federal government can only accept bids that are at or above “fair market value” and rejected the bid.

The scheduled Wyoming coal lease sale was postponed without a new date set.

As for generally bringing back economic growth and new energy development, Gianforte said Montana is encouraging it by loosening its tax structure – something opponents have said will only benefit higher income levels. According to Montana Free Press reporting, the Montana Entrepreneur Magnet Act “exempts shareholders of Montana-based businesses from paying capital gains taxes on stock options.”

“Our goal is to get entrepreneurial golden geese to fly here and lay golden W-2 eggs,” Gianforte said.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/66c6a7f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/640x336+0+72/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Flegacy%2Fsites%2Fwpr%2Ffiles%2FOil_well.jpg,N,,2025-10-17 19:03:09.922295

The decision comes just five weeks after NextDecade announced a positive investment on a fourth liquefaction train at the Rio Grande LNG facility, reflecting shifting regulatory priorities and more rapid decisions by project developers.

President Donald Trump, on the day he was inaugurated, issued Executive Order 14154, “Unleashing American Energy,” which aims to streamline permitting processes on energy infrastructure development as a matter of national security.

The president’s order directed the Secretary of Energy to immediately resume reviews of all pending applications for LNG export projects to countries without a free-trade agreement with the U.S., reversing a year-long “pause” in regulatory approvals initiated by the Biden administration.

On August 29, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) issued a final order affirming an earlier determination that the Rio Grande LNG terminal including trains four and five was in the public interest, clearing the last major regulatory hurdle. FERC’s order came about three months before the previously scheduled release date, according to S&P Global.

NextDecade projects the total cost of Train 5 and related infrastructure at about $6.7 billion. Train 5 is commercially supported by 20-year supply agreements with JERA, EQT Corp, and ConocoPhillips for a total of 4.5 million tons of LNG each year, with deliveries expected in the first half of 2031.

One graph showed the capacity factor at one location for August at , with the year so far showing an average of 14% output.

The concern: shouldn't that number, at least for summer, be much higher?

“Simply powering New York state with solar is just a large waste of land and a large waste of natural resources,"" said meteorology graduate Chris Martz, who is also a member of the Committee for a Constructive Tomorrow. ""Because I'm a land conservationist, I think we should have more natural landscape, more national parks. We should preserve that.""

Other farms show similar numbers, like Delaware River Solar, LLC on East River Road. Its capacity from February 2022 to November 2024 for electricity generated.

Martz said a good portion of the year in Upstate New York it can be overcast. He said solar on homes and businesses is a great idea, but large-scale solar projects? Not really. He said the average number for output varies, but seeing an average number in the 20s is about all you'll get at a maximum for our region.

""But on average, it's about 20% to 22% to 26% roughly,"" Martz said. ""That's probably a margin of error there.""

On its best day, he said, solar doesn’t match other energy sources like coal or nuclear.

""Solar power has the lowest power density,"" he said, adding, ""The amount of energy that solar generates is between 5.8 and 11.6 watts per square meter. And then coal power is 26.3 to 105.2, natural gas is 185 to 740, and nuclear fission is 228 to 760 watts per square meter of energy. That's just the power density, so solar is by far the lowest.""

Doreen Harris, president of the said New York actually leads the nation in solar power, producing about 7 gigawatts of combined distribution. She said It’s part of an energy portfolio to create a greener future and ease the energy load, adding solar projects and partnerships in the state can range from small to large-scale.

“We certainly do see a diversity of resources as being beneficial to New York's energy future,"" said Harris, adding, ""We're deploying many different technologies in order to get from here to there from the perspective of a reliable and affordable and clean grid.""

Harris said we will never have the same solar generation as say, Arizona or New Mexico, ""but we've really seen the ways in which this technology can continue to improve and benefit New Yorkers at the same time.""

She said the solar projects are actually a ""huge savings to New Yorkers during the heat waves this summer,” adding the amount came in at about $90 million.

Charlie Remelt owns 100 acres of farmland in Henrietta, and about a quarter of it is dedicated to solar and rented out to a company. As a farmer, he is still able to grow chrysanthemums between the panels, which can shift and move to draw in maximum sunlight. He said farms like his helps feed the strained summer grid.

“Air conditioners, air handlers, running those all draws a lot of lot of energy, and having that supplemental during that time of year is a big plus,"" he said.

Remelt added the town of Henrietta is very forward-thinking when it comes to green energy.

""Their farmland protection (allows) farmers to put solar on their property and generate some extra income to keep the properties from becoming all developed,"" he said.

Harris also said when it comes to solar, it is a major generator of jobs and billions of private investment.

The Montreal-based company said Oct. 9 that final site selection is expected this fall with construction of the facility to begin next year.

The first phase of the project, representing at least a $200 million investment, could remove 30,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide directly from the air per year, it said.

At full scale, the plan is for a facility with annual removal capacity of 500,000 tonnes.

Deep Sky recently began operations of its first facility in Alberta, testing various technologies with an annual capacity of 3,000 tonnes.

The company says Manitoba’s ideal geology, clean energy and welcoming legislation helped make it the choice for expanded operations.

“What Deep Sky is building in Manitoba isn’t just one of the world’s largest carbon removal facilities, it’s the foundation of an industry that will reshape our economy and our planet,” said chief executive Alex Petre in a statement.

The province passed legislation last year to allow for carbon dioxide storage, with regulations expected to be passed this fall, the company said.

Manitoba Premier Wab Kinew said the regulatory framework will allow companies to establish in the province and tap into federal tax credits to grow the industry.

“Technology is going to be part of the fight against global warming,” said Kinew, speaking to reporters in Winnipeg on Thursday.

“And if we can create some good jobs and economic opportunity here, at the same time that we are exploring a new technology that might help us in the fight to save the environment … I think we should do that.”

North Carolina's Solar for All program, dubbed EnergizeNC, planned to install at least 43 megawatts of solar energy over five years.","North Carolina and 22 other states are suing the Environmental Protection Agency, seeking to reinstate a $7 billion program meant to help low-income and disadvantaged communities install rooftop solar power systems.

The Solar for All program was created in 2022 by the Inflation Reduction Act, with states and local governments required to apply to receive funds from the program. North Carolina's $156 million award would have helped put solar panels on more than 12,000 homes, according to N.C. Department of Environmental Quality officials.

But in August, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin canceled the program, before states could spend billions of dollars from it.

N.C. Attorney General Jeff Jackson and 22 of his colleagues are arguing the the EPA did not have the authority to cancel the program and rescind funds that had already been appropriated by the U.S. Congress for a specific purpose.

Furthermore, Jackson said, while the EPA pointed to this summer's Big Beautiful Bill as the impetus to slash Solar for All, Congress was clear that it did not intend to rescind Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund money that had already been obligated with that legislation.

""This is a pretty straightforward case from a legal standpoint. I think EPA just decided that they would rather not spend this money, and they're willing to act in defiance of Congress, and we're just going to go to court and point that out,"" Jackson said in an interview.

When EPA canceled Solar for All, North Carolina had yet to receive over $150 million of its fund. Jackson said the state was just weeks away from drawing that money down.

""We had already been awarded the funds. The funds were sitting in an account marked for our state,"" Jackson said.

In an Aug. 8 video announcing that the EPA was canceling the Solar for All program, Zeldin pointed to H.R. 1, the sweeping spending and tax legislation Congress passed this summer.

""But the bottom line again is this: EPA no longer has the authority to administer the program or the appropriated funds to keep this boondoggle alive. With clear language and intent from Congress in the One Big Beautiful Bill, EPA is taking action to end this program for good,"" Zeldin said.

Jackson and the other attorneys general contend that Zeldin and EPA are misinterpreting what Congress intended under H.R. 1.

In fact, court filings say, members of Congress were very clear that any Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund awards that had already been obligated should be allowed to continue serving their originally intended purpose. Solar for All was part of that program.

The law itself says, ""Section 134 of the Clean Air Act ... is repealed and the unobligated balances of amounts made available to carry out that section ... are rescinded.""

And when the bill was being marked up before the House Energy and Commerce Committee's Subcommittee on the Environment in May, then-chair Rep. Morgan Griffiths, a Virginia Republican, said, ""These provisions that we are talking about only apply as far, as this bill is concerned, to the unobligated balances. So if a grant was already given, as far as this bill is concerned, then that would still be going forward.""

Impact in North Carolina

If Solar for All moved forward, state officials anticipate that it would help more than 12,000 households install solar panels, helping them save an average of 20% on utility bills. That's worth about $400 on average, according to the Clean Energy Fund of the Carolinas.

The N.C. Department of Environmental Quality also points to the potential for solar panels to be paired with storage systems, providing energy to a home in the case of a prolonged power outage.

""The program’s cancellation would hurt the electric grid’s ability to be resilient to future disasters, and would hamper North Carolina’s efforts to ensure reliable, clean and affordable energy supplies to meet the needs of a rapidly growing population and rising energy demand,"" DEQ Secretary Reid Wilson said in a statement.

North Carolina's Solar for All program, dubbed EnergizeNC, planned to install at least 43 megawatts of solar energy over five years. It would have focused on single family homes, as well as multifamily housing, homes where residents have medical needs and some community solar pilot programs.

""EnergizeNC was primed to deploy a pilot program for home solar and battery backup that would offer back-up power during grid outages for households with medical equipment needs. That battery backup equipment would do double-duty by helping utilities manage the electric grid on very hot or very cold days, when power needs surge,"" Melissa Malkin-Weber, the executive co-director of the Clean Energy Fund of the Carolinas, said in a statement.

The program was also expected to create about 140 jobs in North Carolina, with many of those concentrated in rural areas.

The 23 states challenging the EPA's cancellation of Solar for All filed two separate claims on Wednesday.

In the Western District of Washington, they argued that the EPA 's cancellation of the program violated the Administrative Procedure Act and U.S. Constitution's Separation of Powers Doctrine. States are asking the court to declare the EPA's interpretation of H.R. 1 unlawful and to reinstate the Solar for All program.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f5429f0/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4240x2226+0+303/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F20%2Fa4%2Fba587f9d4defab7b23f11fdd3d26%2Fap25183566192370.jpg,N,,2025-10-17 18:02:49.113821

Today, the Trump EPA is announcing that we are ending Solar for All for good, saving US taxpayers ANOTHER $7 BILLION!","24 states on Thursday commenced a lawsuit against the Trump administration for cancelling a $7 billion solar grant which would have brought solar energy to more than 900,000 low-income families across the country.

The complaint alleges that the termination of the grant program, Solar for All, contravened the contracts between the EPA and the plaintiffs, stating :

The EPA’s unilateral terminations breached the express terms of Plaintiffs’ Grant Agreements, which allowed for termination only in the narrow circumstances of substantial noncompliance that materially impairs performance, adequate evidence of waste, fraud or abuse, or material misrepresentation of eligibility status—none of which occurred.

The complaint also argues that the EPA breached its duty of good faith and fair dealing by “destroy[ing] Plaintiffs’ reasonable expectations regarding the fruits of their Grant Agreements.” Additionally, in a partner lawsuit filed in the Western District of Washington, plaintiffs allege violations of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), contending that the termination was arbitrary and capricious.

California Attorney General Rob Bonta reported California’s decision to join the coalition on Wednesday, condemning the grant termination:

At a time when energy bills are at a record high and only continuing to skyrocket, the Trump Administration is needlessly hampering an industry that can produce safe, reliable, and inexpensive energy. Solar for All was built to deliver relief for all Americans — by lowering energy bills for working families, reducing our carbon footprint, and creating high-quality union jobs that would bolster our economy. We will not let this illegal termination of the Solar for All Program stand. This Administration can try all they want to bend the law, but we will hold them accountable.

By February 2025, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) had entered into binding grant agreements with members of each of the 24 plaintiff states. In August, the EPA declared the cancellation of the Solar for All program and began withdrawing funds from the plaintiffs’ accounts. Lee Zeldin, Administrator of the EPA, announced the move on social media, stating:

Welcome to CleanLaw from the Environmental and Energy Law Program at Harvard Law School. I’m Hannah Perls, and in this episode I speak with environmental justice pioneer Charles Lee, former director of EPA’s Environmental Justice Office and principal author of the landmark 1987 report, Toxic Wastes and Race in the United States, and now a visiting scholar at Howard University School of Law. We’re also joined by Sean Moriarty, former deputy commissioner with the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection.

We discuss the growing field of cumulative impacts analysis and how states are increasingly using this tool in permitting and other programs to advance meaningful protections for overburdened communities across the country. And we should note both Sean and Charles are speaking in their personal capacity and their opinions and views in no way represent the views of their respective institutions. Well, Charles, Sean, thank you both so much for being on CleanLaw.

So a lot of our recent episodes have focused on these big changes to federal environmental law and policy, but today we’re going to shift gears and talk about what I think are some really exciting developments happening at the state level to protect public health and the environment by incorporating cumulative impacts’ analysis into government decision-making and in particular permitting. Now, before we dive in just two to three sentences, what is cumulative impacts analysis and why does it matter? Maybe Charles, we can start with you.

Charles Lee:

First of all, thank you for having me on the podcast. Cumulative impacts speak to the interaction between multiple environmental health and social stressors and their effects on human health, welfare, and quality of life. Cumulative impacts is really about the concentration of environmental and social burdens in certain areas. So places like the Ironbound community in Newark, New Jersey or the South Side of Chicago or Cancer Alley in Louisiana. And it is something that while many communities that are overburdened aren’t familiar with the term, they really know all the issues involved because this really reflects their lived reality.

Hannah Perls:

Sean, is there anything you would add?

Sean Moriarty:

Sure, I would love to add to that, just love adding anything to what Charles says. It’s an extreme pleasure in my life to work with this man. I think the only thing I would add, is that when you’re looking at cumulative impacts from the regulatory perspective, and certainly the way that I come to this, having spent time at New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection. I think what cumulative impacts attempts to do is really to account for impacts that are missed when you look at things through traditional media-based permitting approaches. So those media-based approaches, which is, for example, air or water, they’re more narrowly crafted and they look at specific impacts that any given facility has, but they don’t really consider the context in which those facilities exist.

So when Charles mentions the Ironbound community in Newark or the South Side of Chicago or these places, our traditional approach to permitting doesn’t consider the proximity of these facilities necessarily to vulnerable populations and particularly kind of their abundance or concentration in certain areas during permitting. And what cumulative impacts attempts to do is to take a broader view of these things and I think a more complete view of the impacts that facilities have and try to, through some of the various statutory and regulatory approaches that we’re seeing across the country, to try to remedy or remediate some of those disproportionate impacts.

Charles Lee:

So there’s a term that’s always used when people talk about cumulative impacts, which is talking about total burden. And so I think this is what Sean is speaking to. The idea here is to the extent that we can, we want to take into account all those burdens, particularly those that we normally don’t capture, either because of the regulations or because of the way that we currently do the analysis.

Hannah Perls:

I really appreciate that, and I think for a lot of our listeners, they’ll be familiar with the federal frameworks, which often think about pollutants either on a source by source basis or even a pollutant by pollutant basis. And what I hear you both talking about, and I think the way that we all experience pollution in our daily lives where this is sort of intuitive and common sense. We don’t experience just particulate matter and just lead in the water or in lead paint. We experience all of those things collectively. And then the impact will depend on who we are. It might depend on how much money we have. It might depend on our pre-existing vulnerabilities. So this is about taking that holistic view that better represents people’s reality.

And I wanted to pull out something you both said, which is you have the analysis itself that gives you that sense of what people are living in, in terms of the pollution or the background stressors, which we will get into. But then there’s also how you operationalize it. And I think, Charles, this is something that you’ve said that this research must go beyond merely proving existence of disproportionality. So I think a real focus of this conversation is once you have that assessment, how do you operationalize it? And in particular, how do you do that through legal frameworks? And in particular, permitting, which is the real example we have out of New Jersey.

And I do want to just tell our listeners a bit more about who you both are because I am extremely excited to have you both on the podcast given your expertise and experience. Charles, I want to start with you. So you of course are recognized as one of the foremost national experts on this cumulative impacts issue and a longtime participant and leader in the environmental justice movement in the United States. And just for listeners who might not be familiar with your work, you left EPA this year after 26 years with the agency to join the Environmental and Climate Justice Center at Howard University School of Law as a visiting scholar.

And of course, before joining EPA, you worked as an advocate and a researcher, notably as the principal author of Toxic Wastes and Race in the United States, this landmark 1987 report. And you helped organize the First National People of Color Environmental Leadership Summit in 1991. And this is an abbreviated biography. Charles, I’m just very, very grateful to you for being on this podcast and sharing your expertise with us. I wanted to ask you, as your decades of work show, this is not a new idea. The concept and assessment of cumulative impacts is ingrained in many of our federal environmental statutes. But I want to know how you started working on this issue and then if there’s anything that you’re seeing now in this moment that feels new.

Charles Lee:

Thanks for the question. I think this issue of cumulative impacts has always been part of the environmental justice conversation. It’s very natural because when we talk about environmental justice, we’re really talking about the lived reality or the lived experience of communities. And so as we said before, we don’t experience pollution one at a time. We experience it holistically. We live with all these pollution and other factors all at the same time. So this is really part of that conversation. So I think at the very beginning of when environmental justice emerged as an issue of national concern, this issue of cumulative impacts just kind of naturally grew up along with it.

For example, the National Environmental Justice Advisory Council, which is EPA’s formal advisory council on environmental justice, had its very first meeting in 1993, the issue got raised. And now virtually in every meeting since then, the issue gets raised over and over again. And just the way that people understand this issue and the ways to deal with the issue has evolved over the several decades that environmental justice has been on the national stage. It is not true that cumulative impacts that we’re just beginning to address this in government decision making. It’s been part of the conversation on that level for many years.

And in fact, going back to around 2010, 2012, California developed a cumulative impact mapping tool that now is used for allocating resources to the areas which are most overburdened. And that’s something that has been done in other states like New York and Illinois and during the Biden administration, that is what the Justice40 Initiative is all about, which calls for 40% of the benefits of a class of environmental and health programs that must go to benefit overburdened communities.

Hannah Perls:

Charles, one thing that you mentioned, I just want to pull out a little bit, is you talked about a lot of different ways that cumulative impacts analysis has been operationalized in state and federal programs. And I think there’s a helpful three-part framework that the Tishman Center at the New School offers, which is they group them into sort of three buckets and you touched on all three buckets, but just to sort of make that clear for listeners. One is this analytical function, just understanding how these disproportionate burdens map out. And so that is sort of what you were talking about with CalEnviroScreen, that mapping tool. Another is this redistributive mechanism, right?

We’re going to use this information to better understand how we can equitably allocate public resources to make sure people who are most impacted get the resources and investments they need. And that would be Justice40. And then I think, Sean, this is a great segue to your expertise. That third bucket is this regulatory operationalizing function where you actually integrate this analysis into how agencies make decisions. And of course, Sean, this is your expertise with the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection. So I’m going to provide you a brief introduction so our listeners have a sense of who you are and the expertise that you bring.

You, of course, come to this as a former state regulatory lawyer, which is a very specific type of lawyering.

Sean Moriarty:

Yes, it is.

Hannah Perls:

And I think our listeners would also love to hear a bit more about what does that mean to be a regulatory lawyer? But in particular, I think what’s really exciting about your expertise is you were one of the lead attorneys at the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection when the agency was tasked with implementing New Jersey’s landmark 2020 environmental justice law, which included a very explicit and complex cumulative impacts mandate that needed to be integrated into the state’s permitting program. So can you share just a little bit as we flagged, what does it mean to be a regulatory lawyer and then a little bit about that work in particular implementing the EJ law?

Sean Moriarty:

Sure. So first of all, putting my bio up next to Charles’ is kind of insane, right? Charles is going to do a whole book talking about where he comes from, and I can do my entire origin story in about two minutes. So I’m going to do that. So I worked for the state and I would say truly the best thing that ever happened to me in terms of changing kind of a professional trajectory to something that I think is really much more meaningful than what I might’ve otherwise been able to do. So I’d worked for the state for a good decade or so, and I was very fortunate to work my way up through the DEP to become the deputy commissioner and general counsel. And that’s like dream job scenario for me for any kind of regulatory lawyer.

You think that that’s unattainable in your little space and then you get a couple of lucky breaks and you find yourself in a position of great privilege honestly. So early in my tenure in that job as deputy commissioner, I was asked to take part in this meeting with community members from the Ironbound Community Corp on an issue. It was related to environmental compliance reviews for facilities eligible for renewable energy credits. At the time, did not think it was that big of a deal, to be honest with you. So met with staff, we prepared our fairly standard response, which if you’ve ever dealt with government, it’s probably not going to be all that fulfilling when you hear it.

And went to the meeting thinking that this would be kind of my typical interaction with advocates who’ve dealt with people repeatedly over the years and felt like I had a sense of what to expect. Very quickly realized that was not the case. So after giving kind of the department’s response, one of the community members, I’m not going to name her, but she’s very well known and a very powerful voice in this space, immediately and forcefully told me that I should be fired. And if you’ve never thought you were doing your job and thought you were doing it well, and then were told very directly that you did not deserve to sit in that position, I would recommend it because it really pushes you back and it makes you have to reconsider why you’re there.

So while that wasn’t the first time, and definitely not the last time I’d been yelled at as a state worker, this was different, right? There was an urgency and kind of, I don’t even know what the right word is, a power behind those words.

Hannah Perls:

That sort of moral imperative.

Sean Moriarty:

I wasn’t prepared for that, and I hadn’t felt that in these meetings before. So perhaps initially just out of self-preservation, we regrouped, we changed our tune, and went back to the drawing board on this. And over the next several months we worked to find what I felt was a better solution. But ultimately we were much more transparent, much more open about what our constraints were, what we could do, what we couldn’t do. And I think we found better common ground on the issue. And luckily for me, I kept my job. So what I took from that were really two lessons. First, that the department can and should do better in these spaces.

And secondly, that in my position, instead of just getting the information and delivering it, I had the ability to influence better outcomes. So while I’ve never confirmed that this is the case, I’m pretty certain that my handling of that issue was at least part of why our then commissioner, Catherine McCabe, came to me and said, “I think you need to be the person to handle this rule making process.” When the state environmental justice law was passed. So with those lessons, we began this process of engagement, and a big part of that process was a continuous and direct conversation with the community members and advocates who had championed the bill. This was their law.

They had worked they decades to get it passed. And I think that’s part of thinking about how we can do things better and how we can do things differently, was to talk to them directly every two weeks for the entirety of our rulemaking process. And in our first meeting, which was fun times during the height of COVID, so all this is happening on the computer. I just went in and just openly admitted that I am probably somebody who looks a lot like the people you interacted before that you felt let you down. And what I would never do in that situation is I would never ask them to trust me because that would not work. So what we committed to, I specifically and the rest of our team, is that we would work to earn their trust through this process.

And to make this slightly long story, slightly shorter, we got the rules done and the person who wanted me fired some five years later, we now count each other as friends, and we’re still trying to find ways to collaborate together. And to me, if you’re a regulatory lawyer in this space or any other space, I think the lessons there are at least pretty clear to me that you’re going to get a lot farther by being transparent, by being genuine, by being real with folks, letting them know what you can and can’t do, and ultimately working to earn that trust as opposed to just sitting there and being a bureaucrat. And I think that type of approach that we adopted as a department is really what helped us to be able to be successful in putting this rule together, in getting it adopted, and ultimately working on the implementation.

And I think that was a big deal for me. It really kind of changed the way that I approached all of this, and then I quit DEP and then Charles came calling and said, “Hey, let’s do some more of this work together.” And I said, “Yeah.” And I made a bunch of changes and now we’re here doing this podcast. So it’s all pretty cool.

Hannah Perls:

I think that’s another good universal rule. If Charles Lee asks you to do something, you do it.

Sean Moriarty:

Yes. The answer is always yes.

Hannah Perls:

The answer is always yes.

Charles Lee:

Can I add something to that?

Hannah Perls:

Absolutely.

Charles Lee:

So as part of the process that Sean led was a stakeholder engagement process that was, I think, in my mind, not just excellent, but really educational. And so they did a number of stakeholder meetings, which are recorded, and on the New Jersey DEP website, there’s a whole encyclopedia of all the recordings and you hear the advocates. And these were not just advocates, but the communities and other stakeholders all engaging with Sean and other members of New Jersey DEP over really substantive issues. And what you listen to if you listen carefully, is how these issues are worked through, not just in terms of what’s important to the communities involved, but what is practicable under the kind of laws and regulations that DEP has to work with.

So it is really an educational thing. And what I think I would draw from that is this has been this conversation in the environmental justice space about how environmental justice is not just a procedural matter, it has been to a large extent, still happening in many cases, is that government agencies would just hold a meeting and then they would check the box. There’s this is Fourth Circuit opinion about the Atlantic Coast Pipeline, where it basically says environmental justice is not a check-the-box exercise. And so moving beyond that to addressing these issues substantively is I think the heart of what the New Jersey DEP process is all about.

And I think that stands as a real hallmark as far as something that’s truly valuable that this whole process brings to good governance and to transparency and meaningful involvement.

Sean Moriarty:

Thank you for highlighting that, Charles. So I would always tell people, if you’re a glutton for punishment, you can watch all those videos because it’s a full day’s worth. I’m not joking, 24 hours of just my bald floating head talking about environmental justice stuff. But in all seriousness, I think that comes back to this idea that in doing this work, it’s okay to approach things differently, that it deserves a better approach. It deserves more because we’re trying to correct longstanding historical inequities. And that you can’t do that by just using the same approach and the same modus operandi that you always use. It has to be different. It has to be focused. If we’re going to talk that talk, we had to walk the walk.

So we did eight months of stakeholdering with everybody. We broke it down piece by piece, every single decision that we made there. And it didn’t mean that we were going to just do what everybody told us to do, but what we were going to do is sit there and take the time to explain exactly why we felt we wanted to move in a different direction, get feedback on that, present proposals. So before the rule was ever proposed, before things were finalized, everyone involved in that process had a really, really clear and strong understanding of what the rule was going to say. There were no surprises when the thing came out.

Charles Lee:

One thing maybe to add to that is that what I found really helpful for me was the idea that those conversations were really problem-solving conversations. That the whole way that the development of those regulations was approached was that it was a trying to solve problems and not just solve problems alone, but collectively.

Hannah Perls:

We’ve just been saying and using the words disproportionality, burden, stressors. And one thing this law is really trying to get at is the historical legacy of often governmental choices that decided where polluting facilities would be sited or decided where we would invest public dollars to build out sewer or wastewater infrastructure. And each state has its unique context, not just in terms of its current industrial mix, but also the particular communities that were excluded from democratic processes or excluded from the benefits of environmental decision making.

And so Charles, obviously, as one of the people who first documented this in that 1987 report, I was wondering if you could just talk a bit about how you understand disproportionality and why it’s so important that we not just understand it, but operationalize it in the way we make decisions now.

Charles Lee:

Thanks for that. I mean, I think one of the things that 1987 Toxic Wastes and Race report did was to really bring evidence to bear about this idea that environmental burdens and benefits, that there’s a distributional aspect to that. And this has been built upon in the 40, 50 years since then with a whole explosion of research. I mean, there’s probably thousands of peer reviewed journal articles in all aspects related to environment, health, sustainability, climate and transportation, healthcare, green space. And as you pointed out, it also offers us a way to understand not just what is, but how it got there.

So a great example of this would be the issue of redlining in the 1930s and all the research that’s being done ever since the University of Richmond digitized the redlining maps in the 1930s and the research that began to correlate our current environmental and health conditions with what grade you were in terms of the 1930s HOLC Maps, H-O-L-C, redlining maps.

Hannah Perls:

That was the Home Owners Loan Corporation, H-O-L-C?

Charles Lee:

That’s right. Home Owners Loan Corporation. And so it’s really remarkable to see that areas which were deemed the worst or the least desirable areas that ended up being areas where we disinvested in are the places that have the highest asthma rates or the greatest temperature rise. There’s heat islands and lack of tree cover, and these relationships really help to explain why current environmental conditions are the way they are today. And I think that the larger question behind all this is that in our environmental analysis and decision making process, we really need to think more about the distribution of environmental benefits and burdens.

Hannah Perls:

So I want to get to what that final product is because now we sort of built up and built up and built up all the anticipation.

Sean Moriarty:

Excitement is off the charts.

Hannah Perls:

This is a very extended movie trailer for the New Jersey DEP rules. And I want to start to dig into the complexity of the really concrete decision points that the regulators made as part of this engagement process. And I should say that, Sean, you and I and another one of our colleagues, Sarah Hart-Curren, we are working on a forthcoming legal guide that will just lay out the legal considerations for integrating cumulative impacts analysis into state permitting. So we’re not going to get into sort of the science and methodology of cumulative impacts analysis. There are a ton of really amazing resources. A lot of this is Charles’s work and his colleagues like Paul Mohai and others.

I want to talk about the legal framework. So if you’re a regulator and you’re starting from the authorizing statutory language, right? The New Jersey legislature says to New Jersey DEP, “Do this thing.” Sean, can you talk a little bit about what you saw as sort of the crucial decision points in designing this program and how you as a regulator look at statutory language and come out with a rulemaking process that as you said isn’t just process for process’s sake? It’s going to deliver concrete protections consistent with what the legislature demanded.

Sean Moriarty:

Sure. That sounds great. What the law kind of requires is it requires the department to consider how certain specific facilities operating in what we call overburdened communities, and those are set by specific demographic criteria, are going to contribute to environmental public health stressors in a way that is, as we term it, disproportionate when compared to what I would say is its neighbors, right? So what you’re doing is you’re looking at environmental conditions in specifically identified communities and trying to figure out if they are worse essentially than other communities. And what it allows you to do is consider those impacts on a facility-wide basis as opposed to the kind of more narrow way you would look at it.

If you’re looking at it from an air pollution perspective, you’re looking at stack emissions, or if you’re looking at it from water pollution perspective, you’re looking at a point source emission. This allows the department to consider things much more broadly on a facility-wide basis. And that lets you get at things that you can’t otherwise get at through traditional environmental permitting structures, particularly trying to address mobile sources and their impacts on PM2.5, diesel particulate matter. Some of these things that really affect quality of life in overburdened communities that we didn’t have the tools to really address previously. So when you ask what the big decision points are, the statute gives us some guidance.

It tells us what facilities to look at, largely solid waste facilities, major air sources. It tells us what communities to consider. We need to figure out, “Well, first and foremost, how do you do that in comparison?” And we do so by defining specific environmental and public health stressors. So we had a list from the statute that includes concentrated areas of pollution, mobile sources, sites, and then other things that may cause, being a critical term “may cause,” public health impacts, including asthma, cancer, elevated above levels, a bunch of things, right? We needed to be able to plot those out with data for the entirety of the state. So we had to look at a bunch of different data sources.

We started with 60, we ended with about 26. 26 pieces of data that would inform those statutory categories, those statutory stressor categories. Our goal in doing so was to use as much publicly available and kind of reliable data as possible, feeling that that would give us a more objective baseline upon which to begin to evaluate facility contributions. And setting that baseline is really, really important to ultimately determining whether just proportionality exists. So we created through that process the Environmental Justice, Mapping, Assessment, and Protection Tool or EJMAP.

And what that does is ultimately plots out the relative stressor levels for all of the communities in the state of New Jersey, the overburdened communities and non-overburdened communities, and then allows us to do a comparative analysis of those stressors between communities. And then for any of those individual stressors where the presence in an overburdened community is higher than it would otherwise be in a non-overburdened community, those are considered “adverse.” We’re able to sum those up through what we call the matrix method. So you could take each of the individual stressors, you can make a determination about whether they are higher than what you would see in non-overburdened communities.

And then you add those up and that gives us kind of an overall assessment of disproportionality across all of those communities. That’s the biggest and most crucial decision point. From there, what we really ask of facilities is to simply address their contributions to those stressors, particularly where they’re disproportionate. So through that process, you have a baseline assessment, you have an assessment of disproportionality, the department does all that work, makes that available, and then a facility comes in, and they have to make decisions about what they are or not going to be able to do to address their contributions.

In that way, I think it takes a fairly complex concept and makes it pretty simple and something that based on a chart that you can pull down from EJMAP, you can really understand exactly what the environmental conditions are in a particular community. And as a facility or as a community member, then you can start to make decisions on how you can work to lessen those areas of disproportionality or adversity. I think it’s a really, really powerful way to look at it and data being really the backbone and the critical component to that. That really unlocks a lot of the other aspects of the law that ultimately can work to lessen those impacts.

Hannah Perls:

Sean, I just want to emphasize one more part of the New Jersey program, there’s really crucial clear statutory language in the New Jersey law that requires New Jersey DEP to deny a permit if certain thresholds are met. So if you could imagine a community where you have an elementary school and there’s a facility that’s already there and it wants to expand and expanding that facility would mean that that community bears a much higher disproportionate pollution load cumulatively. New Jersey under the law, the DEP now has very concrete mandates about what to do in that situation. So I was wondering if you could briefly explain how that works.

And then Charles, I’m going to ask you why we don’t just copy and paste the New Jersey law for all the other 49 states.

Sean Moriarty:

So I think one of the aspects of the law that is important to understand is the difference in authorities with regard to denials. So the original version of the bill, and this is probably one of the reasons why you don’t just cut and paste it because you maybe could do a little bit better. But the original version of the bill would’ve had mandatory denials when you are causing a disproportionate impact. So impacting a community in a way that is going to make it have disproportionate burdens or is going to further exacerbate existing and disproportionate burdens. That was changed.

And the way that the law works now is that the department only has the authority and in fact has the mandate to deny permits for new facilities that are going to cause disproportionate impact unless they will meet the compelling public interest standard. So for those facilities, if you are seeking to site a new facility in the community you described, that’s already subject to significant adverse burdens, unless the facility can completely avoid contributions to those adverse burdens, it is denied unless it meets compelling public interest standard and that’s drawn narrowly. It focuses on really kind of critical public health or environmental needs of the community.

And I think when you’re thinking about critical statutory terminology when, in the definition of compelling public interest, it specifically uses the words “in the overburdened community.” I think that we highlighted that, we underlined it, we put it in different color every time we did a presentation because when you’re scoping out what that looks like, centering the needs of the community is absolutely critical to avoid continued kind of exacerbation of historic inequities.

Hannah Perls:

I think we’ve been using a lot of big terms, but I think this is fundamentally a public health bill. And when we talk about denying new facilities, it is a recognition that that contribution would dramatically impede people’s public health. Is that accurate?

Sean Moriarty:

Without question. We talk about reality, we talk about lived experience, all that stuff. It’s like what is it like to go outside your house? If you live in some of these communities that are considered overburdened that we’ve kind of mapped out and have not only meet specific demographic criteria but also have increased environmental and public health burdens. You might be walking outside of your house and you might see diesel trucks going to the nearby solid waste facility the entire day and how that impacts your quality of life.

They might technically raise particular levels of a particular pollutant, but at the end of the day, it’s like what does that feel like to live there and can we do better to make it so when people walk outside the air that they breathe is cleaner and that the water that they find around the corner in the stream is not incredibly dirty and all of the things that some of us are fortunate enough to take it for advantage. So you deny those facilities when it’s going to further impact the quality of life. For existing facilities, and one of the changes to the bill is that the department can only condition those permits.

So if an existing facility or that facility that is next to the elementary school that’s expanding, they effectively under the law have a right to expand. The department in turn has a right to impose additional conditions on that expansion that are intended to, and we set this out in the regulations. We set a hierarchy of avoidance, minimization, and in certain situations, net environmental benefit that requires a facility to go through and assess its impacts to those stressors and look at all feasible ways that they can avoid those impacts. And if they can’t avoid them, then they need to minimize them.

And if you’re expanding, then you need to do something else for the community to try to address the fact that an expansion that increases contributions to public health stressors, we are accepting that that is going to increase a level of disproportionality. So in that situation, what the rules ask is that if we’re going to accept that and we are going to agree that you can do that, then we’re going to ask you to do something else to try to reduce elsewhere because we can’t get around the fact that you’re adding. And to us, and to me, that was critical because you got to think about what the goals of the law ultimately are.

Preventing new facilities is a good and laudable goal, but how you deal with those existing facilities to me is just as critical because if you’re going to improve conditions over the long term, you’re ultimately going to need to reduce the contributions from those facilities. And that’s what we really sought to do through the regulatory process, is to drive those down at each renewal iteration or each expansion to try to minimize as best we could what those impacts would be. And hopefully over the long term see significant lessening of that documented disproportionality.

Hannah Perls:

I should say, it’s not prevent all new facilities, it’s preventing facilities that have negative public health consequences in areas that already are experiencing significant public health burdens and making sure that we don’t make it even worse, if that is fair.

Sean Moriarty:

That is very fair.

Charles Lee:

When I was at EPA and we would bring Sean over to present under New Jersey DEP’s regulations and methodology, and all the attorneys at EPA would say, one thing about this that really stands out in my mind. They called it, it was an approach that was elegantly simple, that it was really easy to see and to implement. To me one of the things that… It doesn’t have to be that complex. That you could do it in a way that’s legally and scientifically defensible and be very straightforward. So I think that’s one thing that we take away, lessons from what happened in New Jersey, that would be one of them in terms of what kind of tool or what kind of analysis method that we’re striving for that it’d be elegantly simple.

Sean Moriarty:

And I think on that point, so this is a cumulative impacts titled podcast. When Charles describes what that means, he talks about interactions of chemicals and how that affects inherent or population-based vulnerabilities. I think it’s important to distinguish what we did in New Jersey in our now called matrix approach from a true cumulative impacts analysis. It is not that. It does not attempt to account for the interactions of those chemicals in the air or in the water. It does not attempt to necessarily account for how those specific mixtures of chemicals will affect folks based on their vulnerabilities.

All it does is attempt to look at, we talked about this earlier, what is the reality of environmental and public health conditions in a particular community? And then it works to try to address those. So one of the big points of pushback in earlier department efforts to try to address cumulative impacts and ultimately was hanging over the idea of actually passing a bill in 2020, was whether you could actually do this. Because at that time, and things have advanced, and there’s reports coming out even yesterday showing how it kind of a true cumulative impacts analysis that work is advancing. At the time, now five years ago, there were people who could credibly say, “You actually can’t do this.”

And if you can’t do it, then what’s the point of passing a law that says you should? And what we were able to do, and I’ll give a lot of credit to folks like Steve Anderson, Sherry Driver who worked at the department for years and years and years on this work, quietly behind the scenes in their extra time. When we were negotiating the bill, they were able to show proof of concept on these things. They were able to say, “We know where all these facilities are and can plot them out based on this demographic criteria. We can show you that most of your major air facilities are concentrated in very specific places.”

And I think that the work that you do to carefully consider the data, carefully consider how you want to quantify these things, is really important in how it will ultimately be translated into regulation, into operation.

Hannah Perls:

You mentioned a report that came out yesterday. So we’re going to link to the report that just came out from the National Academies on cumulative impacts analysis, which we should say Charles played a part in. Charles, we’ve been talking about a lot of concepts that you’ve pioneered and I want to lift those up. So one piece I think as we look at other states that have adopted cumulative impacts programs or have bills moving through their legislature, and there’s a significant number. We have I think eight states that have cumulative impact requirements in their permitting program specifically, and then an additional 10 states that have bills moving that would adopt a similar framework.

And I think a common question is, well, why don’t we just copy and paste the New Jersey bill? And the response is this “fit for purpose” framework that you’ve pioneered. And so I just want to have you explain that a little bit. What does that mean and what are the different decision contexts that people should think about when they’re trying to apply this framework to their particular situation?

Charles Lee:

Thanks for that. I’ll try to do a good job on this.

Hannah Perls:

And I will say, to your research, I’m asking you to explain a lifetime of work in five minutes.

Charles Lee:

Well, first of all, I mean this idea of fit for purpose, I think it has been in the public health environmental analysis literature, it’s been in the risk assessment literature. And I came across it when I was thinking about how the environmental justice analysis has come about and evolved. And so I guess you can define this as that different types of decisions may require, probably will require different types of analysis, different types of data, different combinations of quantitative and qualitative analysis, different degrees of quantification to inform them. And what we want to do is not just to do an analysis for its own sake, but to inform decisions. So the analysis should be tailored to the decisions that we’re trying to make.

And so in the environmental justice space, when we first started to develop EJ mapping tools like CalEnviroScreen and US EPA’s EJSCREEN, we did this with the idea of just trying to identify places where you can go to do more outreach or analysis, and we never thought of it as something that can be used for any purpose other than that. And then what happened in California was that a law was passed as Senate Bill 535, that called for 25% of the proceeds of the greenhouse gas reduction fund in the state to benefit what they call disadvantaged communities. And CalEPA decided to use CalEnviroScreen to make those determinations.

And for me what that meant was that some of these tools that we originally developed that we didn’t know could be used for these type of purposes, it turned out that these tools can in fact be used for making very impactful decisions like where you allocate resources. And in California that has amounted to billions of dollars that goes into the communities where they are most in need, the most overburdened, and underserved communities. And that of course has been replicated in other states and became the approach behind the Justice40 Initiative during the Biden administration. But the kind of tools that are going to be necessary for a more regulatory context like permits or rules are probably going to be different.

And we’re seeing these emerge now with New Jersey DEP’s approach in terms of its cumulative impacts and methodology. Again, in the context of your question, different states are going to have different kind of statutory language, and out of that, you’re going to have to develop methods and regulations to suit those statutory goals. I think it’s fair to say that in Massachusetts the approach is somewhat different. It’s much more of a threshold-based, risk-based approach that’s based on health endpoints. And so we don’t need to get into all of that, but that is just to say that there are different approaches emerging even in the permit space.

And I think when we get to national rules, the kind of analysis, the scaled analysis, and the kind of data that’s going to be necessary, and the kind of questions you’re going to have to answer are going to be different. So it’s important to note that cumulative impact analysis is not just one thing, and the key to understanding how to make it so that it is practicable is to understand the decision context and to understand that you can tailor your analysis to suit those decision contexts. So there is a conversation that took place when EPA went to the Science Advisory Board, and I think this is back in 2021, 2022.

When around the recommendations, the Office of Research and Development’s recommendations around cumulative impacts research, and the members of the SAB all said, “This is a really laudable exercise.” But that it was nearly impossible except for one person, Dr. Kristi Pullen Fedinick who said, “It may seem that way, but actually if you start to understand the idea that you have decision context and you can tailor analysis to various decision contexts, then it becomes something you can get your hands around.”

Sean Moriarty:

I’m in love with Charles’s fit for purpose approach. When you think through the different implications of practicality, defensibility, all those things, and how different approaches, single score method out of California, or matrix method out of New Jersey, or risk-based thresholds out of Massachusetts, all of those are valid ways to do this. They all come with different risks, different practicalities, and you can kind of see when you plot them out on that fit for purpose continuum, you can see how they fit together and how they can be used to advance different but at times maybe concurrent priorities.

The other thing about… joke, of course, everybody’s should copy New Jersey because I’m from New Jersey, but I think it’s just important to know every state has communities that have specific needs and specific concerns. So there may be some broad validity to the idea that the approach we took in New Jersey can be kind of operationalized and used other places. But at the end of the day, what this requires, if we’re going to really address cumulative impacts, and we’re going to address these quality of life issues that we’re talking about, is you need to understand the specific types of stressors that are of concern in the communities within your given state, municipality, wherever.

And you need to understand what the types of facilities that are most of concern. So I wouldn’t cut and paste our list of facilities to everywhere else because I don’t think that would be valid, but I do think there are parts to this. There are principles at play that can be useful, but ultimately those things got to be crafted, I think, to meet the needs of the communities. And I think that will have better outcomes, but we can offer perspective and understanding of the tools that are available to folks to try to get at those outcomes.

Hannah Perls:

There’s a menu and you can sort of lay out what’s on the menu and then folks can sort of pick a la carte, what makes the most sense for them in their state.

Charles Lee:

Because the whole point of all this is not just to do the analysis, but it is to utilize them in terms of better decisions.

Sean Moriarty:

And on that menu, how those things interplay is important too. You might not want to select pineapple on pizza because that’s disgusting.

Hannah Perls:

Wow, hard take.

Sean Moriarty:

But those things might be great in other contexts, just maybe not combined all the time.

Hannah Perls:

It’s a very specific take. We might get our first hate mail from people who love Hawaiian pizza. So thanks for that, Sean. As we flagged this is a really exciting and sort of quickly moving tool in terms of seeing states in particular operationalize cumulative impacts analysis in their permitting programs. And so the last question I want to ask you both is if someone is coming to you saying, “We’re really excited about this idea. I’m living in X State, where do I start?” Or they’re coming to you to say, “I’ve looked at New Jersey’s program, I understand it, but I’m trying to figure out what am I not seeing? What am I missing?”

Are there any resources or people or ideas that you would want to make sure you point them towards as they go about this process?

Sean Moriarty:

I think some of the work that Charles has been doing, and I’ve been fortunate to work in collaboration with him on, it’s like trying to build a community of practice around this work and bringing together people with the experience and the perspectives and the understanding and how you define these issues, how you advocate for these issues, and ultimately how you operationalize permitting solutions in the long term. I think that approach is really, really critical to anybody who’s interested in this. If somebody came to me the first thing, I would want to make sure that either they were from the impacted communities or we’re speaking with them. I think that’s the first part.

This has to be driven by folks in those communities. You got to first start there, identify the concerns, and talk to folks and have them drive the bus on this. But I think the work that we’re doing now is to try to create a support system for folks who are on that bus and who want to see these things in their state. And I think you look at the work we did in New Jersey, you look at the work they did in Massachusetts, or look at the ongoing work in New York, Minnesota, Connecticut, you can see how these things are playing out. Everybody’s in different stages. Everybody has slightly different statute, slightly different approach, but all kind of aimed at the same goal of reducing these disproportionalities.

I think by engaging with those folks, by talking to them, by understanding what’s happening in other states and taking advantage of the resources, I think that can help to provide folks with the tools that they need to engage in this conversation, to answer the pushback that they’re going to get, to understand where folks are going to be uncomfortable, and try to figure out ways in which you can craft something that for your communities and in your particular political environment will be workable and move forward. I’ve started to believe that at least personally, having data is really, really critical to being able to identify and demonstrate this issue.

Folks have said, “Well, how do you get the agency to understand?” I would say, “Go for a walk, go out and walk around communities and understand what you’re actually regulating.” That’s one piece. But beyond that, I think having data available, having mapping in some case might be really useful as a first step to be able to demonstrate to folks that there actually is a problem. And then you have the tools available through these other approaches to begin to really address that.

Hannah Perls:

The Tishman Center just released a new dashboard that has a map where you can actually scroll through all the different state laws, rules, and then the bills that are moving. So we’ll make sure to link to that dashboard as well because it’s a really fantastic and easy to use resource. But Charles, I want you to have the last word.

Charles Lee:

I just wanted to build off of what Sean said. It is really important to be in touch with communities around an issue like this. I mean, I found that the interest in this issue, as communities become more aware and more developed in terms of their thinking about how to address these environmental justice and environmental injustice concerns, that cumulative impacts is really rising to the fore. And so it’s important to keep in touch with that. In that context, Sean said it, you can say it in another way. Communities have to be in the lead of the conversation and that we have to really tailor what we do based upon what they think are important, what their aspirations are, and how they want to see these types of issues become addressed.

In that context, we’re seeing this is no longer an area where there’s just a lot of activities. We’re beginning to see scholarship begin to emerge. There’s enough practice now to say that we can begin to understand the contours of what the solutions may look like. And so examples of that are you mentioned the New School’s Tishman Center, has developed a database that catalogs all the new policy on the state level and is a database that’s being added to on a daily basis. So that’s a great resource. Professor Paul Mohai, Megan Cunningham, who was a former deputy commissioner for the Chicago Department of Public Health, and I are co-editing a special issue of the Environmental Justice Journal on cumulative impacts and government decision-making.

That is going to be published in December, and it has 17 articles in it. So we could see that there’s a wide amount of, not just interest, but emerging scholarship and of course yesterday’s release of the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine report on the state of the science and future of cumulative impact assessment.

Hannah Perls:

There’s a lot of resources, a lot of homework for folks. But I think, Sean, just to bring back that community of practice idea, and I think Charles, to your point about the emerging scholarship, it’s not just that people are publishing these things in a bubble. There is a real collaborative community of folks who want to get this right. And so I’m just very grateful to you both for including me in that community, frankly. But I think also just for being willing to have this conversation and share this work, and hopefully this can be a resource for folks as well. So most importantly, thank you for all your work, but also thank you for being on CleanLaw today.

Charles Lee:

Thank you.

Sean Moriarty:

Thank you, Hannah. And thank you to all the folks at DEP who helped me get to this position where I get to have these really fun conversations with folks like you.

Hannah Perls:

In many ways, it’s similar to the AEP project, looking to wring more out of the existing grid to ease congestion.
The AEP project will also rewire the lines with new conductors.","The Department of Energy said Thursday that it had finalized a $1.6 billion loan guarantee to upgrade around 5,000 miles of transmission lines.

The grid upgrades would ease the flow of electricity in Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Oklahoma, and West Virginia. The project, which will address lines owned by American Electric Power (AEP), won’t add any new routes, but it will help existing ones carry more power.

AEP is one of the largest utilities and transmission line owners in the U.S., with operations spanning 11 states. The 5,000 miles that will be upgraded represent around 13% of the company’s total network.

The loan guarantee was initiated under the Biden administration just days before President Trump was inaugurated. Previously, the Trump administration has cited approvals occurring between Election Day and Inauguration Day as justification for canceling projects.

It’s unclear what distinguished this grid modernization project from others that the Trump administration is considering canceling or in the process of canceling.

In Minnesota, the Department of Energy is moving to cancel a $467 million grant that would have helped unlock 28 gigawatts of new generating capacity, most of which would have been solar and wind. Another in Oregon would have issued $250 million in grants to connect half a dozen renewable projects.

But the largest transmission project the Trump administration wants to axe is a $630 million grant to modernize California’s grid. In many ways, it’s similar to the AEP project, looking to wring more out of the existing grid to ease congestion. As planned, the California project would test advanced conductors and dynamic line rating devices, both of which would allow old rights-of-way to carry more electricity. That’s frequently a cheaper option than building new power lines.

The AEP project will also rewire the lines with new conductors. The loan guarantee will allow the utility giant to secure a lower interest rate, saving the company at least $275 million, which it says will benefit its customers.

Energy Secretary Chris Wright said that the loan will “ensure lower electricity costs across the Midwestern region of the United States.” Already, the states included in the project have among the lowest electricity rates in the nation.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/critical-infrastructure.jpg?resize=1200,675",N,,2025-10-17 18:02:42.727815

Starting in 2030, EU gas importers must demonstrate that volumes entering the bloc comply with a yet-to-be-determined methane intensity limit, with hefty fines expected for noncompliance.
The US is the largest exporter of LNG to Europe, shipping an average of about 160,000 tons per day so far this year.
Qatar, the EU’s third-largest LNG supplier behind the US and Russia, has warned it will stop sending LNG to the bloc should sustainability-focused regulations take effect as adopted.
Patrick Pouyanne, CEO of longtime QatarEnergy partner TotalEnergies, told the forum that he had spoken to European Commission Director-General for Energy Ditte Juul Jorgensen about CSDDD and the EU's pending methane regulations.","The flow of US LNG to European markets could be upended unless the EU quickly throttles back its new methane limits and corporate reporting regulations, top industry executives warned this week.

The bloc’s Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD) and related methane standard approved in May 2024 are “the worst, most irresponsible piece of legislation I've ever seen passed anywhere in the world,” Exxon Mobil CEO Darren Woods told delegates at the Energy Intelligence Forum 2025 in London.

The methane regulation extends to all producers, exporters and importers wanting to sell gas into the region, with importers required starting this year to report annual methane emissions data — including from countries and companies exporting to the EU.

Starting in 2030, EU gas importers must demonstrate that volumes entering the bloc comply with a yet-to-be-determined methane intensity limit, with hefty fines expected for noncompliance.

Similarly, financial penalties are expected to be issued for noncompliance with the CSDDD, which sets out sustainability reporting rules covering companies operating in the EU or doing business within it.

The EU is under intense pressure to scrap or drastically modify the regulations, which take effect Jan. 1, 2026, if it hopes to continue importing LNG from the US, which industry executives say can’t possibly comply with the stringent requirements.

The US is the largest exporter of LNG to Europe, shipping an average of about 160,000 tons per day so far this year. The US has accounted for 56% of the bloc’s LNG imports so far in 2025.

The EU is currently working on amending the CSDDD through the commission’s Omnibus Simplification Package, with Brussels having already announced that it is aiming to postpone the entry of CSDDD until 2028.

‘Sell Them Less’

Woods said Exxon is “supportive” of the human rights element of CSDDD but slammed the decarbonization element, as it requires plans that are “consistent with the objectives of the Paris accord, which today are unachievable with the existing set of technologies.”

The CEO also raised concerns with CSDDD’s requirement to reduce the emissions of its global customers, suggesting that the only way Exxon could do that would be to “sell them less.”

“And it requires us to do that, not only in Europe, but everywhere we operate around the world. … That, from my standpoint, is untenable,” Woods said.

Woods stressed that the industry is working to reduce pollutants on its own and isn’t opposed to reasonable government oversight. “Regulations that are overly prescriptive or unrealistic or that, frankly, aren't practical and can't be implemented in the short term — I think those are areas that the industry pushes back against,” he said.

‘I Appreciate the Intent’

Woodside CEO Meg O’Neill told the forum that she has no objection to the EU’s intent on being a “global leader in tackling climate change” and agreed that tackling methane emissions is “good business.”

“Why would you let a molecule that can be constructively used be emitted?” said O’Neill, whose Australian-based company owns the Louisiana LNG export project under construction on the US Gulf Coast.

However, O’Neill said the EU had “fallen short in a couple of areas,” including the complex approach it has taken with its energy policy and the proposal to impose financial penalties on companies failing to adhere to the methane regulation.

O’Neill said the legislation stands to inflate already expensive energy prices in Europe and that European industry “is going to be destroyed.”

""I appreciate the intent, but I'd encourage the European lawmakers to be thinking about unintended consequences because this would have, I think, disastrous ramifications across the continent,” O’Neill concluded.

‘Completely Uncompetitive’

ConocoPhillips CEO Ryan Lance echoed the sentiments of Woods and O’Neill, warning that US LNG producers will increasingly turn to Asia if these provisions remain in effect as adopted.

“[CSDDD] is going to make Europe completely uncompetitive. … We'll bypass Europe and go to Asia and to other parts of the world. It's that significant,” Lance told forum delegates.

But Lance said he is hopeful that “sanity” will prevail in the CSDDD conversation and that people will “move in a more constructive path.”

The Qatari Factor

The US isn’t the only major LNG supplier threatening to turn away from Europe. Qatar, the EU’s third-largest LNG supplier behind the US and Russia, has warned it will stop sending LNG to the bloc should sustainability-focused regulations take effect as adopted.

Qatari Energy Minister and QatarEnergy CEO Saad al-Kaabi has vehemently objected to the CSDDD if it faces financial risks for noncompliance. ""Put simply, if further changes are not made to CSDDD, the State of Qatar and QatarEnergy will have no choice but to seriously consider alternative markets outside of the EU for our LNG and other products, which offer a more stable and welcoming business environment,"" al-Kaabi wrote in a letter to the EU in May.

QatarEnergy owns 70% of the $10 billion Golden Pass LNG export terminal, with Exxon owning the remaining 30%. The companies expect the 18.1 million ton per year (2.5 billion cubic feet per day) Texas facility to begin operating by year’s end, with most offtake currently targeting Europe.

Patrick Pouyanne, CEO of longtime QatarEnergy partner TotalEnergies, told the forum that he had spoken to European Commission Director-General for Energy Ditte Juul Jorgensen about CSDDD and the EU's pending methane regulations.

“I told her, look, you need to make pragmatic things,” Pouyanne said, highlighting the complexity of measuring methane emissions in the US, where gas for LNG plants is generally sourced from the grid — meaning it is hard to pinpoint its origin.

Last month, Jorgensen said she was confident the commission can and will ""implement the methane regulation in a way that doesn't constitute an irritant in any way.”",https://energyintel.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/71ff191/2147483647/strip/true/crop/750x394+0+53/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fenergy-intelligence-brightspot.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com%2F4f%2Fd9%2F99fa1f0d404ca4635b7a687a0613%2Fss-2259427737-regulation.jpg,N,,2025-10-17 23:06:53.552429

In letters to Interior Secretary Doug Burgum and EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, Merkley and Pingree criticized the agency heads for continuing to put public health and public lands at risk while failing to fulfill the mission of the agencies. As senior members of the Senate and House Appropriations Committees, the leaders are carrying out critical Congressional oversight.

“The Agency’s ongoing failure to provide complete information and to work transparently with Congress is unacceptable. As a reminder any reorganization, reprogramming, or funding change is subject to the jurisdiction of the Appropriations Committee,” write Merkley and Pingree, respectively Ranking Members of the Senate and house Interior-Environment Appropriations Subcommittees.

“Decades of institutional knowledge and scientific expertise have been lost and are in further danger of being eroded. Losing staff with specialized training in toxicology, water quality science, and cumulative impact assessment is not efficient and does not achieve mission-critical goals like protecting Americans from environmental hazards, regardless of administration. These are not abstract bureaucratic concerns; these are matters of quality of life, cost of living, and public health,” the Ranking Members told EPA Administrator Zeldin.

In a second letter to Interior Secretary Burgum, Merkley and Pingree press the Secretary to respond ahead of reported RIFs coming as early as next week. Merkley and Pingree pointedly criticize the agency’s attempts to reorganize several offices without providing responses to questions from the subcommittees and its delay in scheduling briefings as required.

“Mr. Secretary, every dollar of funding, every reorganization, every reprogramming, and every funding change or transfer is the direct jurisdiction of Congress and specifically our Committees. The Committees did not receive any notifications, materials, briefings, or other information about this major change – or any of the previous major personnel changes – in order to evaluate it,” write Merkley and Pingree to Interior Secretary Burgum. “There is simply zero justification for the drastic staffing cuts that have already been implemented, let alone another RIF.”

“A staffing loss of this level would cripple our ability to appropriately manage public lands on behalf of the American people, meet tribal treaty and trust responsibilities, and respond to growing threats of wildfire across the landscape and in our communities,” Merkley and Pingree add. “Decades of institutional knowledge were destroyed in a matter of months and are in further danger of being eroded. Losing staff with expertise and experience is not efficient and does not achieve mission critical goals.”

Interior Appropriations Subcommittee Ranking Members Merkley and Pingree cite the critical function of the Interior workforce, many in public-facing roles such as park rangers, refuge staff, and recreation specialists on public lands that span 500 million acres in all 50 states and U.S. territories. Additionally, RIFs would delay Tribes from getting their funding from self-governance contracts.

It would shift the competitive benchmark from battery cost—where China excels—to technological superiority in performance, safety, and convenience.
Wrapping Up Toyota's pivot to mass-producing solid-state batteries is the culmination of its long and deliberate EV strategy.
Born from a deep-seated caution about the limitations of current battery technology, this move is a bold attempt to redefine the electric vehicle landscape.","For years, Toyota, the titan of the automotive world, has been viewed as a reluctant participant in the all-electric vehicle revolution. While competitors raced to launch new battery electric vehicles (BEVs), the Japanese giant seemed to be dragging its feet, earning criticism from environmental groups and EV enthusiasts alike. But a recent announcement signals a potential paradigm shift in its strategy, a high-stakes bet that could either redefine the market or cement its status as a laggard. In early October, Toyota announced a joint venture with Sumitomo Metal Mining to mass-produce cathode materials for solid-state batteries, with plans to launch cars featuring this breakthrough technology by 2027 or 2028. This isn't just an incremental update; it's a potential game-changer. Solid-state batteries promise to be a holy grail for EVs, replacing the flammable liquid electrolyte in current lithium-ion batteries with a solid material, offering higher energy density for longer range, significantly faster charging times, and enhanced safety.

Toyota's Calculated Hesitation

To understand the gravity of this move, one must first understand Toyota's long-standing skepticism towards a BEV-only future. The company that pioneered hybridization with the Prius has consistently advocated for a ""multi-pathway approach"" to decarbonization. For years, Toyota executives argued that a premature rush to all-electric vehicles was misguided. They pointed to several valid concerns: the high cost and environmental impact of battery production, the strain on global mineral supply chains, the lack of robust charging infrastructure in many parts of the world, and the fact that hybrids still offered a more immediate and accessible way for the masses to reduce emissions.

Instead of going all-in on BEVs, Toyota diversified its bets, continuing to refine its world-leading hybrid systems, developing plug-in hybrids (PHEVs), and investing heavily in hydrogen fuel cell technology, as seen with its Mirai sedan. This cautious strategy was often interpreted as stubbornness or a failure to innovate. In reality, it was a pragmatic, if conservative, calculation. Toyota was unwilling to commit its vast manufacturing empire to a technology it viewed as immature and fraught with logistical hurdles. They were waiting for a breakthrough that aligned with their core principles of reliability and mass-market viability. Solid-state batteries appear to be the breakthrough they were waiting for.

A Silver Bullet Against China's Dominance?

Toyota's timing is critical. While it has been cautious, Chinese automakers, led by giants like BYD, have stormed the global EV market. China now dominates the EV space, not just in sales but in the most critical component: the battery supply chain. Chinese companies control a huge portion of the mining and refining of essential minerals and are leaders in producing cost-effective and increasingly popular LFP (lithium iron phosphate) batteries. For Western and Japanese automakers, competing with China on the current lithium-ion playing field is a daunting uphill battle.

This is where Toyota’s solid-state strategy could be a stroke of genius. Instead of trying to catch up in a race they are already losing, they are attempting to change the race entirely. By successfully mass-producing solid-state batteries, Toyota could effectively ""leapfrog"" the current generation of EV technology. A Toyota EV in 2028 with a 600-plus-mile range that can recharge in minutes would represent a monumental advantage over any vehicle on the market today. It would shift the competitive benchmark from battery cost—where China excels—to technological superiority in performance, safety, and convenience. This move is a direct challenge not to match China’s current strengths, but to render them obsolete with a next-generation standard.

Is It Too Little, Too Late?

The multi-billion-dollar question is whether Toyota can pull it off in time. A 2027-2028 launch window feels both tantalizingly close and perilously far away. By then, competitors will have nearly a decade of experience in building and marketing EVs. They will have refined their software, built out their charging networks, and secured their own supply chains for current-generation batteries. Furthermore, lithium-ion technology is not standing still. Advances in battery chemistry and cell design are continuously improving energy density and charging speeds, potentially narrowing the performance gap that solid-state batteries promise to create.

Toyota is in a high-stakes race not just against other legacy automakers like VW and Honda, who also have solid-state ambitions, but against the relentless pace of incremental innovation. If production delays push the launch to 2030 or beyond, or if the cost of the technology remains too high for the mainstream market, Toyota's gamble could backfire spectacularly. In that scenario, they would have squandered precious years while their rivals solidified their positions in the defining automotive transition of our time. The company is betting the house that its technological leap will be significant enough to erase its late start.

Wrapping Up

Toyota's pivot to mass-producing solid-state batteries is the culmination of its long and deliberate EV strategy. Born from a deep-seated caution about the limitations of current battery technology, this move is a bold attempt to redefine the electric vehicle landscape. It serves as a direct counter-offensive to the market dominance established by Chinese manufacturers, aiming to shift the battleground from cost to next-generation performance. Whether this proves to be a visionary masterstroke or a desperate, delayed entry will depend entirely on execution. If Toyota can deliver a reliable, affordable solid-state EV by 2028, it will not only have caught up but will have positioned itself to lead the next phase of the electric era.

Summary: Toyota's plan to mass-produce solid-state batteries by 2028 is a high-stakes gamble to leapfrog current EV technology and challenge China's market dominance, but its success hinges on delivering the breakthrough on time and at a competitive cost.

Energy is not only a national security concern given the leverage it gives Beijing and Moscow, but it is also a massive business opportunity that touches all sectors of the economy, including critical minerals. Despite China and Russia’s advantage, the United States has an opportunity to reestablish itself as a serious competitor by focusing on the development of micro and small modular reactors (SMRs) and also working to coordinate better financing and private engagement to export this technology to its African partners.

600 million Africans lack access to electricity, which is nearly 40 percent of the continent. This shortage not only impacts health, with biomass pollution killing millions of African children every year and the lack of electricity limiting health services, but it also restricts economic development. Mines, data centers, and other economic projects driving economic growth on the continent are energy-intensive. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) estimates that economic growth in Africa will lead to electricity demand growing by 40 percent by 2030 and almost seven times its current level by 2050.

African countries are increasingly turning to nuclear energy, with half of the 30 IAEA “newcomer countries” located in Africa. Renewables, such as solar and wind, will surely feature in Africa’s future energy mix. However, larger energy base loads and more stable and economically efficient energy sources are needed to support the digitization, industrialization, and urbanization underpinning Africa’s economic growth.

While the will for nuclear energy clearly exists, African countries face various challenges in developing nuclear energy sources. First, large-scale powerplants cost billions, mostly in upfront investments, which many governments cannot afford. Additionally, many countries lack the expertise to support the engineering, operational, and regulatory functions involved with nuclear energy. Lastly, nuclear energy requires extensive infrastructure—both “hard” infrastructure to support nuclear facilities and an expanded electric grid, as well as “soft” infrastructure, consisting of the necessary regulatory and institutional frameworks.

Russia has positioned itself as a global leader in the nuclear energy market, including in Africa. The Kremlin is an attractive partner thanks to its comprehensive aid package, which includes generous financing options, educational training, and infrastructure support, all easily accessible through the state-owned energy company Rosatom.21 African countries have signed nuclear cooperation agreements with Russia in the last decade, including at least eight proposed or in progress large-scale nuclear power plants. The Kremlin is also pursuing uranium mining deals in Africa to increase its grip on the nuclear energy market, with the continent holding 20 percent of global uranium reserves.

China is increasingly exporting its expertise. Beijing has rapidly expanded state-backed “nuclear” or “green” Belt and Road initiatives abroad, including in Africa, despite not offering any public nuclear energy financing in Africa from 2012 to 2021. Of the six African countries that have reached at least phase two of the IAEA nuclear development milestones, China has deals with four—Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, and South Africa.In 2024, China held its first China-Africa Forum on the Peaceful Use of Nuclear Technology in Ethiopia and it would hold future fora as part of its 2025-2027 Beijing Action Plan.

Chinese and Russian dominance in the nuclear sector will translate to long-term partnerships and leverage. Beijing and Moscow are securing decades of influence due to the long timelines and wide-ranging scope of nuclear energy projects. Energy also equates to leverage. African countries relying on Chinese- or Russian-backed energy projects or fuel may feel compelled—or be coerced—to align with China and Russia on sensitive topics to protect their economies and overall national security. Moscow has weaponized energy reliance against the West since it invaded Ukraine.

The United States is also missing out on substantial business opportunities by failing to prioritize the energy sector. Africa’s energy sector is one of the fastest-growing sectors on the continent. US companies were involved in over $25 billion worth of deals and had another $20 billion in upcoming projects at the beginning of 2025.

Critical mineral supply chains are also intertwined with energy infrastructure. US energy investments can help establish the energy infrastructure needed to support mineral production and entice greater mine development, securing US mineral access in the process.

The advent of micro and small modular reactors presents an opportunity for the United States to get back into the game. SMRs are better suited for many African countries due to their cheaper up-front cost and better compatibility with smaller energy grids. Their modularity also makes them more resilient to supply chain disruptions and better able to be safely deployed in a wider array of locations, such as rural areas and energy-intensive economic sites.

Fortunately for the United States, SMRs are better suited to American strengths than larger power plants. SMRs are much more compatible with private investment and innovation due to their lower cost, modularity, and potential for mass production. Large-scale power plants, on the other hand, suit China’s and Russia’s state-owned nuclear energy enterprises and the vast sums of public funding they bring to bear.

The United States already has many of the resources it needs to ride the wave of the SMR revolution. The United States has invested billions into developing SMRs over the last decade, and the Trump administration re-approved $900 million in funding to support the domestic SMR development as part of President Trump’s initiative to “unleash” American energy and quadruple nuclear energy production.

The Trump administration has also supported efforts to export this technology through continued support for the FIRST program, a government initiative to leverage public-private partnerships to support partner countries with training and capacity building, regulatory support, and procurement for SMRs. FIRST supports American companies and have already helped the United States secure deals to develop SMR technology in Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, and Rwanda.

Still, the United States will be in fierce competition with China and Russia. Russia has deployed its first floating SMR domestically and is negotiating deals to export the technology to coastal African countries. China and Russia have both developed their first land-based SMRs and signed deals with South Africa and Zimbabwe, respectively, to eventually export SMR technology.

Given this position, the United States must focus on scaling up its efforts. Financing will remain a key issue, and joint funding arrangements—both for Western developers and African buyers—should be a focal point. The United States should work with its allies to help co-develop and co-finance SMR exports to Africa. Such partners include Argentina, Canada, Japan, and South Korea, all of which are FIRST contributing members with already-existing projects in Africa.

The United States’ engagement with Africa’s regional economic and power blocs will be critical. Africa has eight regional economic blocs and five regional power pools, which support cross-border electricity trading. Engaging these blocs will generate joint funding for multi-country projects. For SMRs, this could take the form bulk orders, which would make SMR exports more financially viable for private companies. Regional energy investments will also support other regional infrastructure, trade, and investment opportunities, including in the critical mineral sector.

Another financing option, public-private partnerships, are becoming increasingly viable. Development finance institutions such as the World Bank and European Bank for Reconstruction and Development have become more willing to fund nuclear energy projects in recent years. This shift will hopefully be mirrored by African and other international funding institutions that have avoided nuclear energy funding.

To support these various initiatives, the United States and its African partners should make better use of comprehensive tools already at their disposal—the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) and Power Africa. For African countries, AfCTFA will help mobilize capital to invest in regional public-private partnerships and make it easier for countries to export surplus energy, both of which encourage the scaling of energy projects. AfCTFA will also enable African countries, especially those in the FIRST program, to become leading partners with the United States in further spreading nuclear technology and expertise on the continent without trade restrictions. For US companies, AfCFTA has the potential to create a more unified market and regulatory system across national borders, further enabling bulk orders and making it easier to work with multiple countries.

The Trump administration should restore funding to Power Africa, a program clearly aligned with the President’s energy initiatives that was, unfortunately, collateral damage during the 2025 DOGE cuts. The program had incentivized more than $80 billion in commitments from other private and public funding streams since 2013, resulting in an added 14.3 gigawatts of electricity and a more than tenfold return on its funding. Renewing Power Africa would secure more joint funding, public-private partnerships, and support other de-risking tools­—such as loans and loan guarantees—to drive US investment.

African countries have identified nuclear energy as a promising energy source, and the United States should listen to its African partners. African countries do not want to be beholden to Beijing or Moscow, but Washington must offer competitive alternatives. The United States is well-positioned to do so with the advent of SMRs, but it must make better use of its tools to scale its current efforts.

(P&GJ) — The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) projects North America’s liquefied natural gas (LNG) export capacity could more than double by 2029, driven by major U.S., Canadian, and Mexican terminal expansions now under construction.

According to EIA data and trade reports, total North American LNG capacity is expected to rise from 11.4 Bcf/d in early 2024 to 28.7 Bcf/d by 2029 — with the United States accounting for nearly 14 Bcf/d of that growth. The region’s expansion represents more than 50% of anticipated global capacity additions through the end of the decade.

United States: Gulf Coast Expansion Leads Growth

U.S. additions are concentrated along the Gulf Coast, already the world’s largest LNG export hub. Several large-scale projects — including Port Arthur LNG Phase 1, Rio Grande LNG, Woodside Louisiana LNG, Golden Pass LNG, and CP2 Phase 1 — have reached final investment decisions and are under construction. Combined, they will add more than 10 Bcf/d of new capacity.

Plaquemines LNG and Corpus Christi Stage 3 began shipping cargoes earlier in 2025 but have not yet reached commercial operations. Pipeline infrastructure remains a key constraint, as new projects are needed to deliver gas from producing basins to coastal terminals.

Canada and Mexico Add West Coast and Floating Capacity

In Canada, LNG Canada shipped its first cargo in mid-2025, marking a milestone for the nation’s first LNG export facility. The project’s two trains will produce up to 1.84 Bcf/d, with a second phase planned to double capacity after 2029.

CHICAGO (October 17, 2025) – This week, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) began removing hazardous waste from the former Glycerin Traders facility at 3522 South State Route 104 in La Porte, Indiana. EPA estimates the work to remove hazardous waste will be completed this fall, weather dependent.

More than 700 containers of liquid waste are stored at the property, the contents of which are unknown. Labels on some containers indicated the potential presence of hydrochloric acid, organic peroxides, and potassium nitrate. Containers of acids, oxidizers, and flammable oxidizers were observed on pallets. Many containers of hazardous chemicals are in poor condition, open, corroded, or bulging. The improper storage of the chemicals could result in a release of hazardous substances into the environment or a fire, leading to EPA’s swift action to remove the immediate threat to public health and the environment.

EPA will identify the waste, and consolidate, package and remove any hazardous substances off-site for proper and safe disposal. Air monitoring will be conducted during the cleanup to ensure cleanup activities on-site do not impact air quality off-site. Nearby residents may notice increased vehicle activity in the area and workers in personal protective equipment.

Background:

Glycerin Traders operated as a waste-materials refining and processing facility between 2010 and 2024. The facility historically received waste oils, acids, flammables, solvents, and unknown materials to be processed into usable products. Indiana Department of Emergency Management (IDEM) found Glycerin Traders in violation of numerous Resource Conservation and Recovery Act waste management practices. IDEM requested EPA assistance to assess whether the site met the criteria for a time-critical removal action from the agency in April 2025.

More information about the response is available at the Glycerin Traders removal website.

A total of 223 projects were terminated after a review determined they did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs or were not economically viable, the Energy Department said.
Electric utilities that receive loans through the program must provide assurances to the government that financial benefits from the financing will be passed on to customers, the Energy Department said.
Wright, in a conference call with reporters, distinguished the AEP loan guarantee from a $4.9 billion federal loan guarantee the department cancelled in July.
The loan guarantee to AEP was among those conditionally approved under Biden, a fact Wright acknowledged to reporters.","WASHINGTON (AP) — The Department of Energy said Thursday it has finalized a $1.6 billion loan guarantee to a subsidiary of one of the nation’s largest power companies to upgrade nearly 5,000 miles of transmission lines across five states, mostly in the Midwest, for largely fossil fuel-run energy.

AEP Transmission will upgrade power lines in Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Oklahoma and West Virginia to enhance enhance grid reliability and capacity, the Energy Department said. The project, first offered under the Biden administration, is meant to help meet surging electricity demand from data centers and artificial intelligence.

Ohio-based American Electric Power, which owns AEP Transmission, is one of the nation’s largest utilities, serving 5.6 million customers in 11 states. It primarily produces electricity from coal, natural gas and nuclear power, along with renewable resources such as wind and hydroelectric power.

Thursday’s announcement deepens the Trump administration’s commitment to traditional, polluting energy sources even as it works to discourage the U.S. from clean energy use.

Earlier this month, the administration cancelled $7.6 billion in grants that supported hundreds of clean energy projects in 16 states, all of which voted for Democrat Kamala Harris in last year’s presidential election. A total of 223 projects were terminated after a review determined they did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs or were not economically viable, the Energy Department said.

The cancellations include up to $1.2 billion for California’s hydrogen hub aimed at developing clean-burning hydrogen fuels to power ships and heavy-duty trucks. A hydrogen project costing up to $1 billion in the Pacific Northwest also was cancelled.

The loan guarantee finalized Thursday is the first offered by the Trump administration under the recently renamed Energy Dominance Financing program created by the massive tax-and-spending law approved this summer by congressional Republicans and signed by President Donald Trump. Electric utilities that receive loans through the program must provide assurances to the government that financial benefits from the financing will be passed on to customers, the Energy Department said.

The project and others being considered will help ensure that Americans “will have access to affordable, reliable and secure energy for decades to come,” Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in a statement.

“The president has been clear: America must reverse course from the energy subtraction agenda of past administrations and strengthen our electrical grid,” Wright said, adding that modernizing the grid and expanding transmission capacity “will help position the United States to win the AI race and grow our manufacturing base.”

The upgrades supported by the federal financing will replace existing transmission lines in existing rights-of-way with new lines capable of carrying more energy, the power company said.

More than 2,000 miles of transmission lines in Ohio serving 1.5 million people will be replaced, along with more than 1,400 miles in Indiana and Michigan serving 600,000 customers, the company said. An additional 1,400 miles in Oklahoma, serving about 1.2 million people and 26 miles in West Virginia, serving 460,000 people, will be replaced.

The projects will create about 1,100 construction jobs, the company said.

The loan guarantee will save customers money and improve reliability while supporting economic growth in the five states, said Bill Fehrman, AEP’s chairman, president and chief executive officer. “The funds we will save through this program enable us to make additional investments to enhance service for our customers,” he added.

Wright, in a conference call with reporters, distinguished the AEP loan guarantee from a $4.9 billion federal loan guarantee the department cancelled in July. That money would have boosted the planned Grain Belt Express, a new high-voltage transmission line set to deliver solar and wind-generated electricity from the Midwest to eastern states.

The Energy Department said at the time it was “not critical for the federal government to have a role” in the first phase of the $11 billion project planned by Chicago-based Invenergy. The department also questioned whether the project could meet strict financial conditions required, a claim Wright repeated Thursday.

“Ultimately that is a commercial enterprise that needs private developers,” Wright said. The company has indicated the Grain Belt project will go forward.

Trump and Wright have repeatedly derided wind and solar energy as unreliable and opposed efforts to combat climate change by moving away from fossil fuels. Wright said the Grain Belt Express loan was among billions of dollars worth of commitments “rushed out the door” in the waning days of former President Joe Biden’s administration.

The loan guarantee to AEP was among those conditionally approved under Biden, a fact Wright acknowledged to reporters.

“Not all of the (Biden-era) projects were nonsense,” he said, adding that he was “happy to move forward” with the transmission upgrade.",https://www.louisianafirstnews.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/80/2025/10/68f1596ae6a417.68033726.jpeg?w=1280,N,,2025-10-17 16:02:46.368245

Despite numerous setbacks caused by the Trump administration, California is making its direction clear: electric vehicles are the future.
Of the 124,755 ZEVs purchased in Q3, 108,685 were battery electric vehicles (BEVs) - another all-time high.
Compared to Q2 2025, EV sales increased by nearly 30%.
About the California Energy Commission (CEC) The California Energy Commission is the state’s primary energy policy and planning agency.","Hydrogen and Electric Vehicles: California Breaks Sales Record for Zero-Emission Vehicles in Q3

Sacramento (USA) - Demand for zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs) in California is soaring, despite efforts by the Trump administration to hinder the Golden State’s pursuit of a 100% clean energy future. In the third quarter of 2025, 29.1% of all new car purchases were ZEVs - a new record.

As California Governor Gavin Newsom announced, Californians bought 124,755 zero-emission vehicles between July and September. Despite numerous setbacks caused by the Trump administration, California is making its direction clear: electric vehicles are the future.

Record EV Sales in California

“This is unprecedented - we’re nearing a third of all new vehicles sold in the fourth largest economy on the planet being clean cars,” said Governor Gavin Newsom. “ We’re setting new records because this state believes in innovation, not isolation. While Trump sells out American innovation to China, California will keep charging ahead on our path to a future of cleaner air.”

Nancy Skinner, Commissioner of the California Energy Commission (CEC), added: “This is a defining moment for California’s ZEV progress and sends a clear message to Washington: ZEVs are here to stay.” She emphasized that the work and investments of the CEC and its partners in expanding the state’s charging network have paid off, with almost every Californian now living within 10 minutes of a fast-charging station.

Skinner’s message is clear: “Now, new EV owners can enjoy a great driving experience bidding goodbye to smelly gas stations, messy oil changes, and costly engine tune-ups.”

Lauren Sanchez, Chair of the California Air Resources Board, added: “ While the federal government stumbles backward with reckless rollbacks and short-sighted policies, California charges ahead lighting the path to a cleaner, more prosperous future. From pioneering clean transportation in the 1970s to becoming the world’s 4th largest economy today, we’ve proven time and again that protecting air quality and the climate isn’t just the right thing to do, it’s smart economic policy.”

Diversity and Growth in the ZEV Market - Expanding Charging Infrastructure

The zero-emission vehicle market is becoming increasingly diverse: in Q1 2025, 146 ZEV models were available, compared to 105 the year before. Of the 124,755 ZEVs purchased in Q3, 108,685 were battery electric vehicles (BEVs) - another all-time high. Compared to Q2 2025, EV sales increased by nearly 30%. Consumer confidence in both the technology and the infrastructure is visibly growing.

California is the first U.S. state to implement binding reliability and reporting standards for public charging stations, improving the performance of publicly funded fast chargers and ensuring greater transparency across the state charging network.

On October 8, 2025, the California Energy Commission (CEC) approved the construction of 64 new fast chargers along key highway corridors under the NEVI program, helping to reduce range anxiety. Grants were also approved for the repair of 30 existing and installation of 30 new fast chargers. Three additional grants totaling over $10 million will fund the construction of more than 1,000 Level 2 chargers, primarily in multi-family housing for low-income and underserved communities.

Low-income Californians are also eligible for thousands of dollars in grants and rebates when purchasing a ZEV. The state is cutting red tape and prioritizing infrastructure development in hard-to-reach regions.

One Million Charging Points - The Gold Standard for American EV Infrastructure

While state funding programs continue to boost ZEV adoption, driving electric vehicles is becoming increasingly practical in everyday life. California now has over 200,000 publicly accessible charging stations, located at supermarkets, park-and-ride facilities, gas stations, apartment complexes, workplaces, clinics, and sports venues. This is complemented by around 800,000 private home chargers, a crucial factor for widespread EV adoption.

About the California Energy Commission (CEC)

The California Energy Commission is the state’s primary energy policy and planning agency.

Both lawsuits filed against the agency accuse the EPA of illegally revoking money promised under the Solar for All program without congressional approval.

Solar for All was established in 2022 with the Inflation Reduction Act, which granted $7 billion in federal funding to help lower-income families access solar panels and battery storage programs. The program was expected to save participants an estimated $1,740 annually on their utility bills. After President Trump took office in January, Solar for All grants were largely frozen. In August, the EPA formally terminated Solar for All, citing President Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act. According to EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, the EPA did not have the authority to administer the program or the appropriate funds to keep the program running.

The first lawsuit pushing back against the EPA’s cancellation of Solar for All came earlier this month when a group of plaintiffs comprised of solar energy companies, labor unions, and homeowners filed a lawsuit in Rhode Island accusing the EPA of ending Solar for All in violation of federal law. The plaintiffs assert the program was expected to secure 4,000 megawatts of new solar energy over five years, generate 200,000 new jobs, and would have helped save energy costs. Their complaint also accuses the Trump administration of attempting to recapture “billions of congressionally approved dollars in climate funding that was approved during the Biden administration.” The plaintiffs are seeking an injunction and for the EPA to reinstate the Solar for All program.

The latest lawsuit was filed Oct.13 by Harris County Attorney Christian Menefee. Harris County, which is comprised of Houston and the surrounding area, is contesting the cancellation of more than $400 million in solar energy grants earmarked for Texas-based organizations. Menefee’s complaint claims that the One Big Beautiful Bill Act did not give the EPA authority to cancel Solar for All grants as those funds had already been legally committed to the program. The complaint further asserts that the EPA’s cancellation of funding “jeopardizes the county’s ability to deliver critical infrastructure promised to create thousands of well-paying jobs, protect residents from extreme whether by reinforcing the county’s electrical grid, and reduce energy costs for tens of thousands of low-income households.”

The lawsuits are not the first to challenge the EPA’s termination of Biden-era climate grants. There have been numerous lawsuits filed since President Trump took office challenging the EPA’s termination of federal funding awarded through the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund (GGRF), most notable, Climate United Fund v. Citibank. In April, the District Court for the District of Columbia in the Climate United Fund Matter issued a preliminary injunction that prevented the EPA from effectuating GGRF grant terminations while the litigation was pending. In September, however, an appeals court set aside the preliminary injunction in its entirety, stating that “the grantees are not likely to succeed on the merits because their claims are essentially contractional,” asserting that the claims must be brought before a special court that handles contract disputes involving the federal government. The grantees are appealing that decision and proceeding with litigation.

The Climate United Fund matter is one to watch as more entities file suit against the EPA for the termination of funds under GGRF and the Solar for All program. While that litigation is pending, however, the EPA is likely to face additional lawsuits over its funding cuts.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.16177_1251.png,N,,2025-10-17 17:08:01.448546

A total of 223 projects were terminated after a review determined they did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs or were not economically viable, the Energy Department said.
The loan guarantee will save customers money and improve reliability while supporting economic growth in the five states, said Bill Fehrman, AEP’s chairman, president and chief executive officer.
Wright, in a conference call with reporters, distinguished the AEP loan guarantee from a $4.9 billion federal loan guarantee the department cancelled in July.
The loan guarantee to AEP was among those conditionally approved under Biden, a fact Wright acknowledged to reporters.","WASHINGTON — The Department of Energy said Thursday it has finalized a $1.6 billion loan guarantee to a subsidiary of one of the nation’s largest power companies to upgrade nearly 5,000 miles of transmission lines across five states, mostly in the Midwest, for largely fossil fuel-run energy.

AEP Transmission will upgrade power lines in Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Oklahoma and West Virginia to enhance grid reliability and capacity, the Energy Department said. The project, first offered under the Biden administration, is meant to help meet surging electricity demand from data centers and artificial intelligence.

Ohio-based American Electric Power, which owns AEP Transmission, is one of the nation’s largest utilities, serving 5.6 million customers in 11 states. It primarily produces electricity from coal, natural gas and nuclear power, along with renewable resources such as wind and hydroelectric power.

Thursday’s announcement deepens the Trump administration’s commitment to traditional, polluting energy sources even as it works to discourage the U.S. from clean energy use.

Earlier this month, the administration cancelled $7.6 billion in grants that supported hundreds of clean energy projects in 16 states, all of which voted for Democrat Kamala Harris in last year’s presidential election. A total of 223 projects were terminated after a review determined they did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs or were not economically viable, the Energy Department said.

The cancellations include up to $1.2 billion for California’s hydrogen hub aimed at developing clean-burning hydrogen fuels to power ships and heavy-duty trucks. A hydrogen project costing up to $1 billion in the Pacific Northwest also was cancelled.

The loan guarantee finalized Thursday is the first offered by the Trump administration under the recently renamed Energy Dominance Financing program created by the massive tax-and-spending law approved this summer by congressional Republicans and signed by President Donald Trump. Electric utilities that receive loans through the program must provide assurances to the government that financial benefits from the financing will be passed on to customers, the Energy Department said.

The project and others being considered will help ensure that Americans “will have access to affordable, reliable and secure energy for decades to come,” Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in a statement.

“The president has been clear: America must reverse course from the energy subtraction agenda of past administrations and strengthen our electrical grid,” Wright said, adding that modernizing the grid and expanding transmission capacity “will help position the United States to win the AI race and grow our manufacturing base.”

The upgrades supported by the federal financing will replace existing transmission lines in existing rights-of-way with new lines capable of carrying more energy, the power company said.

More than 2,000 miles of transmission lines in Ohio serving 1.5 million people will be replaced, along with more than 1,400 miles in Indiana and Michigan serving 600,000 customers, the company said. An additional 1,400 miles in Oklahoma, serving about 1.2 million people and 26 miles in West Virginia, serving 460,000 people, will be replaced.

The projects will create about 1,100 construction jobs, the company said.

The loan guarantee will save customers money and improve reliability while supporting economic growth in the five states, said Bill Fehrman, AEP’s chairman, president and chief executive officer. “The funds we will save through this program enable us to make additional investments to enhance service for our customers,” he added.

Wright, in a conference call with reporters, distinguished the AEP loan guarantee from a $4.9 billion federal loan guarantee the department cancelled in July. That money would have boosted the planned Grain Belt Express, a new high-voltage transmission line set to deliver solar and wind-generated electricity from the Midwest to eastern states.

The Energy Department said at the time it was “not critical for the federal government to have a role” in the first phase of the $11 billion project planned by Chicago-based Invenergy. The department also questioned whether the project could meet strict financial conditions required, a claim Wright repeated Thursday.

“Ultimately that is a commercial enterprise that needs private developers,” Wright said. The company has indicated the Grain Belt project will go forward.

Trump and Wright have repeatedly derided wind and solar energy as unreliable and opposed efforts to combat climate change by moving away from fossil fuels. Wright said the Grain Belt Express loan was among billions of dollars worth of commitments “rushed out the door” in the waning days of former President Joe Biden’s administration.

The loan guarantee to AEP was among those conditionally approved under Biden, a fact Wright acknowledged to reporters.

“Not all of the [Biden-era] projects were nonsense,” he said, adding that he was “happy to move forward” with the transmission upgrade.",https://finance-commerce.com/files/2025/10/Transmission.jpg,N,,2025-10-17 19:03:43.620708

From the September / October 2025 Issue

Arizona has continued to advance a robust set of economic development strategies designed to attract businesses and retain jobs across diverse industries. The state emphasizes both streamlined access for entrepreneurs and substantive incentives to assist both established firms and underserved communities.

One of the state’s flagship initiatives in 2025 has been the BuildItAZ Apprenticeship Initiative, administered by the Arizona Office of Economic Opportunity. This program targets workforce shortages in critical sectors such as construction, infrastructure, and advanced manufacturing.

By offering millions in competitive grants to registered apprenticeship programs, Arizona aims to double its apprenticeship participation by 2026. In 2025, the state awarded $3 million in new grants, supporting employer partnerships, training capacity, and wrap-around services like childcare and transportation for apprentices. A third round of grants was also launched to help programs expand facilities, hire instructors, and purchase training equipment.

The state has also expanded career pathways through Talent Ready AZ, a cross-agency initiative designed to align education with industry needs in high-demand fields like clean energy, IT, aerospace, and healthcare. The ReadyTechGo program, part of this initiative, launched accelerated technical training programs at community colleges, enabling Arizona residents to earn industry credentials within weeks rather than over years.

The Arizona Office of Economic Opportunity has proposed a key initiative called the Arizona Microbusiness Loan Program. Launched in 2024 and activated in 2025, this program supports microbusinesses—those with five or fewer employees—by providing loans to up to $50,000 through community lending partners. The program reinvests repayments back into the loan pool, ensuring sustained support for small-scale entrepreneurs across rural and urban communities.

Business One Stop is an online portal revamped in early 2025 to streamline business formation and compliance. The platform enables fast, multi-agency registration and filings, aimed at reducing manual processes. In 2025 so far, it auto-approved nearly 1,500 new businesses and eliminated over 13,000 business days of bureaucratic delay.

Innovative support for underserved entrepreneurs is exemplified by Impact AZ 2025, a minority business accelerator offering training, mentorship, and supplier-diversity readiness. Launched statewide in 2025, the program connects minority-owned businesses to public and private contracting opportunities, builds business capabilities, and fosters job growth.

Arizona: Where The Future Takes Shape

Arizona continues to set the pace for economic growth, leading the nation in high-tech investment and innovation.

As home to global companies across in-demand industries, the state has earned a reputation as a premier destination for technologies shaping the future.

In the fiscal year that ended on June 30, 2025, the Arizona Commerce Authority (ACA) and local economic development agencies worked with companies that committed to creating 24,285 projected new Arizona jobs and investing over $31 billion in Arizona communities.

“Arizona’s economic momentum has never been stronger, fueled by strategic initiatives that are supporting high-paying job growth in communities statewide,” said Sandra Watson, President and CEO of the Arizona Commerce Authority. “With our unmatched business climate, skilled workforce, top-tier education institutions, and strong industry clusters, Arizona continues to attract global leaders across high-tech industries, further supporting our local small businesses and suppliers.”

This success is no accident. It reflects years of smart policy, forward-looking investments, and a business-friendly environment that consistently attracts top talent and industry leaders. Arizona’s innovation ecosystem, bolstered by world-class universities and a highly-skilled workforce, offers the full package for companies seeking to scale and thrive.

Today, Arizona is globally recognized for its leadership in semiconductors, aerospace and defense, biosciences, batteries, AI, and more. As the state continues to attract global leaders in high-growth industries, it’s clear Arizona is the ideal location for business success.

Reliable energy powers sustainable growth. In addition to abundant talent and a pro-business climate, Arizona offers one of the most reliable and resilient energy grids in the nation—critical for advanced and large-scale operations. With minimal weather-related disruptions, Arizona experienced only six extreme weather-related power outages from 2000 to 2023, well below the national average.

And, more than 44% of Arizona’s power generation comes from clean or renewable sources. The state is home to the second-largest nuclear power plant in the U.S., the Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station, which generates more than 32 million megawatt-hours annually.

An epicenter for emerging technologies. Arizona is at the forefront of artificial intelligence (AI) and emerging technologies, with global leaders like Apple, Intel, TSMC, Avnet, Cognite, Microsoft, and more operating in the state. Innovation hubs such as Tech Parks Arizona, SkySong, Moonshot, and the Phoenix Bioscience Core are accelerating innovation growth across many sectors.

The state is also home to more than 230 AI-related startups—a number that continues to grow. In recognition of this momentum, the Arizona Commerce Authority selected 10 Software as a Service (SaaS)/AI startups as Fall 2025 Arizona Innovation Challenge awardees.

A premier event destination. Arizona will host SEMICON West, North America’s premier microelectronics exhibition and conference for the first time on October 7-9, 2025. Relocating to Phoenix for the first time after 50 years in San Francisco, the event shift showcases Arizona’s semiconductor leadership. This year’s conference is anticipated to attract more than 35,000 attendees, which would be its largest yet.

Looking ahead to 2026, Arizona will host Arizona Tech Week, the state’s first-ever decentralized tech conference from April 6-12, 2026. The first-of-its-kind conference in Arizona will emphasize the state’s prominent role in the global tech ecosystem and showcase its most compelling innovations and tech leaders.

Ford, GM, and Stellantis have banded together to ask his government to scrap Canada’s zero-emission vehicle mandate, pleading poverty and technological impossibility. Apparently, after a mere century of automotive innovation, these giants have forgotten how to build cars unless they’re permitted to keep belching emissions indefinitely. Their preferred business model involves Canada indefinitely subsidizing nostalgia, rather than seizing an obvious electric future.

Now Stellantis has announced it’s abandoning manufacturing of a major EV line in Brampton, impacting 5,000 Canadian workers.

Let’s be clear. The global automotive market is electrifying quickly, not slowly. Norway is already at nearly 100% electric passenger vehicle sales. China is at 50% of new vehicles being electric. Nepal — Nepal! Sherpas and Mount Everest Nepal! — is seeing 70% of new cars being fully electric now. Europe, China, and the rest of the world have decided that electric is not optional, it is inevitable.

Canada’s Big Three subsidiaries seem to be the last ones clinging desperately to internal combustion engines. Their request to Prime Minister Carney is transparently regressive, like Kodak asking governments to ban digital photography or Blockbuster demanding protection from streaming.

Ironically, these automakers’ insistence on business-as-usual threatens precisely the thing they claim to want: a prosperous Canadian automotive sector. Instead of confronting their own stagnation, they have elected to hold Canada hostage. The message is stark: give us special dispensation to fail, or our factories will fall silent and perhaps be withdrawn entirely. At least it’s an honest threat, albeit breathtakingly entitled.

In a letter to Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Lee Zeldin, the senators condemned the administration’s decision to cancel $7 billion in Solar for All funding in August. The program would have created tens of thousands of good-paying jobs in communities across the country, lowered residential electricity bills by at least 20 percent for more than 900,000 households, and saved working families more than $8.7 billion in electric costs over the lifetime of the panels.

“Your agency’s decision to terminate Solar for All is not only unlawful — given this funding was congressionally appropriated and fully obligated — but also ill-timed. Energy bills are soaring across the country and millions of families are facing higher living costs. Electricity bills are 6.2 percent higher than this time last year, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. EPA’s reckless decision to terminate Solar for All directly undermines efforts by Congress to reduce energy costs and improve grid resilience. It jeopardizes economic investments and inflicts severe job losses across the country while undermining the trust and financial certainty that communities, businesses, and local governments have placed in the federal government,” the senators wrote.

This joint letter, led by Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT), follows a letter sent by Senators Kelly and Gallego, Governor Katie Hobbs, and Representatives Greg Stanton and Yassamin Ansari when the program cancellation was first announced in August.

“The EPA’s illegal termination of Solar for All has left states, communities, and businesses across the country in limbo, with critical projects stalled and vulnerable households facing higher energy costs. We demand the EPA immediately reinstate the Solar for All program, rectify the damage caused by this termination, and ensure grantees can proceed with the swift implementation of residential solar projects to slash utility bills and create many thousands of good jobs. In the meantime, we require a full accounting of how the EPA will rectify the damage caused by this program’s disruptive termination,” the senators concluded. “The American people deserve transparency, accountability, and a government that honors its commitments.”

Washington, D.C. – A new resource from Climate Power revealed that Trump’s decision to cancel or threaten billions of dollars in investments in both red and blue states across the country will put 338,150 good-paying jobs and over $23.88 billion in total grant awards on the chopping block.

Household electric bills are up 10% nationally since Trump took office, and they are rising at twice the rate of inflation. Now, Trump and Republicans are making it worse by laying off workers and spiking costs for American families.

“The Trump administration is vindictively and callously destroying more than 300,000 good-paying American jobs, once again bending the knee to the fossil fuel industry instead of meeting the needs of the American people,” said Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer. “By canceling hundreds of DOE projects, Trump is ripping away billions of dollars that were flowing to both Republican and Democratic states to support domestic manufacturing, expanding our grid and energy supply, and so much more. Much of this funding stemmed from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which passed the Senate with support from 15 of my Republican colleagues that still serve in the Senate. We cannot let this stand. Americans know that canceling a project that is already underway is not how you save money, it is a waste, and it will only serve to drive up costs, kill jobs, and hurt American industry and investor confidence.”

In Leader Schumer’s state of New York, Trump has canceled or threatened 43 grants representing $338 million in investments.

By Mathieu Dion

General Motors Co. and a partner have paused the second phase of a cathode factory in Quebec, resulting in the cancellation of a nickel sulfate project by Vale SA.

GM agreed in 2022 to buy nickel supplies from the Brazilian miner as part of a strategy to build up its battery supply chain for electric vehicles. But weaker-than-expected demand and U.S. policy changes that make EVs less attractive have prompted companies to reconsider investment projects.

The automaker said this week it’s incurring US$1.6 billion in charges tied to its pullback from electric vehicles. Realigning EV capacity will lead to non-cash impairment and other charges of US$1.2 billion, the automaker said in a regulatory filing, while the rest of the costs relate to cancelling contracts and settling commercial arrangements linked to EV investments.

“GM’s long-term strategy is to build a profitable EV business in North America and in light of evolving market dynamics, GM and our partners will pause the second phase of the project,” which involved increasing production capacity of cathode active material, a GM spokesperson said in an emailed statement. The decision was reported earlier by the Canadian Broadcasting Corp.

The Detroit company’s partner in the Quebec venture is South Korea’s Posco Future M Co. The first phase is on track to begin producing material for EV batteries next year, the spokesperson said.

Vale said in a separate statement that GM’s move means it won’t need nickel sulfate for now. “As a result, Vale Base Metals must terminate its nickel sulfate plant project,” which was expected to cost $325 million.

Becancour, Quebec, has emerged as an electric-vehicle battery hub, but a number of projects have now been delayed, including a more than $1.2 billion cathode plant of the battery-materials maker Ecopro Group. Ford Motor Co. was initially part of that project, but pulled out.

In a pair of legal filings this week, the states argued that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) move to cut the $7 billion Solar for All (SFA) program was unlawful and unconstitutional and a breach of its contract with the states.
“EPA has no lawful authority to deobligate any of Plaintiffs’ funds because…Congress directed EPA to appropriate the SFA Funds, EPA obligated the SFA Funds, and Congress did not direct that the SFA Funds be deobligated,” one of the suits said.

The Trump administration said in August it would end the program as part of an effort to save money for the taxpayers.

Under the program written into the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, the money was distributed to 60 entities including states, nonprofits, tribes and local governments.

The Trump EPA argued that provisions in this year’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act that repealed “unobligated” balances of the program allowed it to take the funds back.

The states, in their suit, noted the provision only applies to “unobligated” funds and says that all of the funds in question had actually been obligated.

“Congress did not, however, rescind any funds that had been obligated by ‘the day before the date of enactment’ of H.R. 1, which is July 3, 2025. All of the funds awarded To Plaintiffs were obligated by August 16, 2024,” they wrote.

“Beyond the fact that this energy infrastructure funding has already been appropriated to our state and is owed to Arizonans, protecting solar projects and lower electricity bills is personal to me,” Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes said in a statement.

“Arizona families are already facing sky-high electricity bills, and I will not let the EPA wriggle out of its commitment to fund solar energy projects that would lower costs for more than 11,000 Arizona households,” Mayes said.

The suits came from Arizona, Washington state, Minnesota, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont and D.C.

Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear (D), Pennsylvania Energy Development Authority Chair Jessica Shirley and the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation also joined the suit.

This would be the largest private capital deal on record.

The ownership of the Hyperion data center in Richland Parish, Louisiana, will be split between Meta and alternative asset manager Blue Owl Capital, and the social media giant will only retain 20%. Morgan Stanley arranged more than $27 billion debt and about $2.5 billion equity into a special purpose vehicle to finance the build-out, according to the report.

Meta is not borrowing the capital itself, but the financing entity is, under the SPV structure. Meta will be the developer, operator and tenant of the project, to be completed in 2029. Reuters had previously reported that the social media giant tapped U.S. bond company PIMCO and Blue Owl Capital for $29 billion in financing for the data centers.

The parties took the final step to price the bonds with PIMCO as the anchor lender on October 16, according to Bloomberg News. A few other investors are receiving some allocations of the debt, which matures in 2049.

President Donald Trump had previously announced that Meta would be spending $50 billion for the Hyperion data center. Trump displayed a graphic—allegedly supplied by Mark Zuckerberg—showing the proposed Hyperion data center superimposed over Manhattan to highlight its massive scale, as he announced Meta’s investment in the project.

Neil Richardson, CEO and chairman of the St. Louis Development Corporation at the time, called the project a testament to the city’s investment into workforce development.
“We are starting to see a renaissance of our advanced manufacturing industries in north St. Louis city that will drive growth across the entire region,” Richardson said in 2024.
The Missouri Coalition for the Environment released a report on the project earlier this year calling it a compounding of environmental racism in north St. Louis.","A north St. Louis $500 million development planned to create more than 150 jobs is now in doubt after Trump administration cuts to energy grants across the country.

The Department of Energy has rescinded a $197 million federal grant planned to help ICL Group Ltd., an Israeli company that also operates a battery plant in Carondelet, build a new plant near the north riverfront in St. Louis.

The company reported on the possibility of discontinuing the project in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing last week and estimated it could garner a $40 million investment write-off if it did. However, no final decision has been made, the report stated.

Company officials could not immediately be reached for comment Friday.

In the report to shareholders, ICL states the Department of Energy’s decision is a result of a comprehensive review of funding eligibility for a number of projects that had received grants in the renewable energy sector and elsewhere. The company originally received the grant through a 2021 infrastructure bill during the Biden administration.

ICL group planned to produce materials for lithium batteries at the plant at 460 E. Carrie Ave. The group touted it as the first large-scale plant of its kind in the country. ICL planned to complete the project next year.

The project’s grant is just one of many facing the ax under the Trump administration and Energy Secretary Chris Wright’s plans. Wright said the slashes to the grants will cut $7.5 billion in spending through the termination of 321 financial awards funding 223 projects across the country.

In a statement, Wright called cutting the projects a “critical task” for the Trump administration.

The development community touted the $500 million plant as a big win for St. Louis. Neil Richardson, CEO and chairman of the St. Louis Development Corporation at the time, called the project a testament to the city’s investment into workforce development.

“We are starting to see a renaissance of our advanced manufacturing industries in north St. Louis city that will drive growth across the entire region,” Richardson said in 2024.

On Friday, SLDC spokesman Deion Broxton said the corporation hadn’t received any official confirmation from ICL or the federal government on the plant’s future.

The project had critics. Some community members and environmental groups pushed back against the development over environmental concerns and complaints of environmental racism.

The Missouri Coalition for the Environment released a report on the project earlier this year calling it a compounding of environmental racism in north St. Louis. The report noted the battery plant’s location on the north riverfront would put it in the middle of neighborhoods experiencing a high asthma hospitalization rate.

They pointed to a 2019 report, Environmental Racism in St. Louis, that showed most of the city’s air pollution sources are in predominantly Black neighborhoods.

The group’s policy coordinator, Maxine Gill, said the coalition is concerned about Trump’s freezing of renewable energy project grants but called ICL’s proposed development an “environmental injustice.”

“ICL misused President Biden’s Justice40 Executive Order to place a polluting facility in an already overburdened neighborhood, rather than ensuring that pollution is diverted from marginalized communities as the executive order intended,” she said Friday. “If they choose to cancel their project, we are glad that ICL will not further pollute a neighborhood with some of the highest hospitalization rates for asthma in the city.”

Previously, the Planned Industrial Expansion Authority, a development board of the SLDC, awarded the project a 90%, 10-year property tax abatement and touted the program as part of the city’s Economic Justice Action Plan to invest in marginalized areas in St. Louis.

“We will continue to assess the situation,” Broxton said.

The disclosure requirement became part of TSCA in 1976 to avoid situations like what happened with asbestos, when people became ill or died and society later learned that companies knew their chemical could be harmful, but failed to share that knowledge, said Jim Aidala, a senior government consultant with Bergeson & Campbell PC who formerly helped run the EPA’s chemicals and pesticide office.

EV struggles worldwide Changing U.S. policies aren’t only affecting the EV sales outlook here.","Between July and September, electric vehicle sales in the U.S. hit a record high.

That EV boom wasn’t just limited to the U.S., though: Global EV sales hit an all-time high of 2.1 million in September. Two-thirds of those sales were in China, the world’s largest EV market.

And yet, there’s still talk of an “EV retreat,” both in the U.S. and abroad. Automakers have expressed concerns about their EV profits, and policymakers in Canada and the European Union are pausing, or adjusting, their EV mandates.

There’s an “inherent duality of the market moment we’re in,” says Corey Cantor, research director of the Zero Emissions Transportation Association. “On the one hand, EV sales are higher than they have ever been, and yet automakers still remain concerned.”

Here’s why, and what’s going on in the electric vehicle landscape.

EV rush before tax credits expired

EVs counted for nearly 11% of total vehicle sales in the U.S. between July and September. That’s a big increase from the same time period last year, when their share was 8.6%, according to Cox Automotive, which recently released data about the country’s third quarter EV sales.

That jump wasn’t a surprise—it was expected, experts say. Americans were rushing to buy EVs before the federal tax credits expired on September 30.

The tax credits, part of President Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act, offered up to $7,500 back for Americans who bought a new EV, if the cars they purchased met certain conditions. There was also a credit of up to $4,000 available for used EVs.

President Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” eliminated those tax credits, killing what analysts say was a “key catalyst” for EV adoption. EVs are still seen as a “premium” purchase; in August, the average EV cost more than $57,000, according to Cox—$9,000 more than a similar gas car.

Concerns about future growth

Not every automaker benefited from all those third quarter EV sales, either. Cox Automotive notes that Mercedes-Benz EV sales in that time period were “mostly flat” year-over-year, and Toyota and Nissan sold fewer EVs during that boom than they did in the third quarter of 2024.

Despite the backlash Tesla has been dealing with throughout 2025, that carmaker actually saw an 8% sales increase year-over-year, but its share of total EV sales has fallen. Tesla once made up 49% of all EV sales in the third quarter of 2024, but its share this past quarter was 41%.

Volkswagen, General Motors, Honda, and Hyundai had notable increases in their EV sales. Volkswagen and GM’s sales were more than double the levels one year ago.

But those automakers still have concerns. This week, GM said it was taking a $1.6 billion hit from changing its EV rollout in the U.S. It changed its rollout in part because of Trump’s elimination of the tax credits, and his move to loosen emissions regulations.

These policies make the future far less certain for automakers. “Federal policies could tighten again in a couple of years or remain the same,” Cantor says. “The federal policy pathway is far less clear moving forward than it was a year ago.”

One thing experts do expect is that U.S. EV sales will slump after this quarter, because that surge to purchase before the tax credits expired “pulled forward” sales that would have been spread out over more time. Cox Automotive forecasts that EV sales will “drop notably” in Q4 and through the early months of 2026.

EV struggles worldwide

Changing U.S. policies aren’t only affecting the EV sales outlook here. Trump’s tariffs are also adding costs for automakers in international markets, like Canada and across the European Union.

The EU recently said it would review its 2035 target for cutting car emissions to zero. A policy note published before those talks highlighted challenges for the European car industry, “ including higher tariffs on shipments to the U.S.,” the Wall Street Journal reported, as well as low profit margins for EVs and the growth of cheaper Chinese offerings.

China has been dominating the EV market, not just in its own country but worldwide, in part because it offers extremely affordable EVs—some priced as low as $10,000.

But that could make the market oversaturated. While Chinese EV sales are increasing, that growth is happening more and more “at the expense of profitability,” the Wall Street Journal notes; more than 110 EV brands operated there in 2023, and they likely won’t all last.

Hope for the future

Even before Trump’s policies, there was talk of an EV sales slump in 2024. That’s because while sales were increasing, the rate at which they were growing slowed—a common issue for all new technologies as they vie for mainstream appeal. Early adopters drive that beginning growth, and then the industry has to figure out how to attract everyone else.

Now, changing federal policies are making that next step even more difficult. But EV experts still have hope.

“We’d expect the impact of these policy changes to be most acute during the forthcoming year,” Cantor says. “Overall, the global move towards electric vehicles continues.” The International Energy Agency said in May that it expects one in four cars sold worldwide this year to be electric.

Cox Automotive says EV sales are the future, too. “Cx Automotive continues to believe that over the long term—the next 10 years or more—sales of vehicles powered solely by internal combustion engines will continue to decline,” the company wrote in its Q3 EV sales report. “Electrified vehicles—hybrids, plug-in hybrids and pure EVs—are the future.”

We might not get to that future as fast as EV advocates hoped, though. Biden set a goal for EVs to make up 50% of all vehicle sales by 2030. Cox now says EV sales can hit 25% by then. So growth will be slower, “but certainly moving out of the ‘niche’ category,” Stephanie Valdez Streaty, director of industry insights at Cox, wrote in September.

And though the future of U.S. federal policy is up in the air, experts still say innovations will advance to help the EV market. “Continued innovation in battery technology, improved transparency in battery health and expanding infrastructure give reason for optimism,” Valdez Streaty wrote. “The road ahead will be challenging, but progress will continue.”","https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit,w_1024/wp-cms-2/2025/10/p-1-91423972-ev-sales-figures.jpg",N,,2025-10-17 15:03:00.482957

These incentives make clean energy investments and energy-saving upgrades more affordable for homeowners, renters and businesses to help better manage energy costs. But with many of them set to phase out or change significantly after 2025, now is the time to act.

Here’s how you can make the most of energy tax opportunities before they’re gone:

1. Install Solar Panels on Your Home

The Residential Clean Energy Credit offers a 30% federal tax credit for the cost of installing solar panels, solar water heaters and other eligible systems. This credit can significantly lower the upfront cost of switching to solar power.

2. Upgrade to Energy-Efficient HVAC and AppliancesThe Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit allows you to claim up to $3,200 annually for energy-saving upgrades. This includes:

Up to $2,000 for high-efficiency heat pumps and water heaters

Up to $1,200 for energy-efficient home improvements including insulation

Up to $600 for energy-efficient windows

Up to $150 for a home energy audit

✅ Act Now: Systems and improvements completed by Dec. 31, 2025, are eligible for the credits. After 2025, the credits are scheduled to expire unless Congress extends them.

3. Take Advantage of State and Local Incentives

Federal tax credits often stack with state or utility rebates, which can lower your costs even further. Many states offer rebates for:

Solar panel installations

Heat pumps

Weatherization

EV charging stations

Virginia just launched Virginia Energy Connect, a new online platform that consolidates federal, state and local energy incentive programs into a single hub where users can quickly identify relevant opportunities and understand application requirements.

North Carolina residents can utilize the Energy Saver NC website that helps income-eligible homeowners and renters across the state cover the cost of energy efficiency and electrification upgrades. The program is currently only available for Western North Carolina counties, but will soon be expanded to the rest of the state.

Customers of the Local Power Companies in the Tennessee Valley Authority region can use the Energy Right hub to manage energy costs by taking advantage of the incentives, rebates and tools it offers.

Residents of other states can visit the Database of State Incentives for Renewables & Efficiency to search for incentives in your area.

4. Small Businesses and Landlords: Don’t Miss Out

If you own rental property, farm or a small business, you may qualify for commercial clean energy tax credits, which have a different timeline for expiration due to the One Big Beautiful Bill Act rolling back a number of clean energy tax incentives.

Commercial tax credits under Section 48E: for wind and solar facilities that begin construction before July 4, 2026 or are placed in service by December 31, 2027. If construction begins before July 4, 2026, the project has 4 years to complete construction.

The Clean Electricity Production Tax Credit under Section 45Y: for wind and solar projects, construction must begin by July 4, 2026, or be placed in service by December 31, 2027. If construction begins before July 4, 2026, the project has 4 years to complete construction.

Please let us know if you have feedback.

Dive Brief:

A coalition of 16 Republican state attorneys general sent letters to Amazon, Google, Meta and Microsoft last month, probing the companies’ usage of renewable energy certificates to offset their own energy usage and account for emissions reductions.

The state officials, led by Montana AG Austin Knudsen, said in the Sept. 24 letter they were writing to “raise serious concerns” about the tech companies’ respective claims that they match 100% of their energy usage with renewable energy by utilizing renewable energy certificates that are not tied to a specific project.

The AGs said purchasing these type of certificates, known as unbundled RECs, “does not mean that the companies are using renewable energy, or that they are reducing emissions,” the letter said. The AGs said such claims “appear deceptive” based on rising energy demands from the sector and the current U.S. grid makeup.

Dive Insight:

Renewable energy certificates give companies the rights to “environmental, social and other non-power attributes” of renewables and are obtained when one megawatt-hour of renewable-generated electricity is delivered to the grid, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. Unbundled RECs, while not tied to a project, provide renewable energy projects additional sources of income to keep projects operating and incentivize new generation, according to trade group American Council on Renewable Energy.

In their letter, the attorneys general probed each company’s usage of unbundled RECs, including questions about how they analyzed if additional generation would come online; their energy usage for each of the five years, without considering RECs; how such certificates are used to calculate the company’s energy usage and scope 2 emissions. The AGs also asked the companies how they use RECs to substantiate public energy usage and emissions reductions claims.

“Major tech companies use unbundled RECs to claim that they have achieved 100% renewable energy ‘use’ or ‘consumption,’ and have reduced their emissions,” the letter said. “Both types of claims appear to be deceptive or misleading.”

In addition to Knudsen, attorneys general from Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Indiana, Iowa, Florida, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, West Virginia and Wyoming signed on.

The use of unbundled renewable energy certificates is credited as a part of each of the companies’ respective strategies for matching energy usage with renewable energy. Unbundled RECs represent “a growing proportion of total renewable project revenue” and are “the primary way for many entities to claim the environmental attributes represented by renewable electricity,” according to ACORE.

Amazon said in an email to ESG Dive Friday that it has received and is reviewing the letter from the state AGs. Additionally, it said it expects the number of unbundled RECs it purchases will decrease over time as additional projects come online.

Amazon announced last year that it matched 100% of its operational electricity usage with renewable energy in 2023, seven years ahead of its 2030 target. The e-commerce and tech company said at the time that it invested in more than 500 renewable energy projects, but also said it purchases both bundled — which are purchased in connection to a project — and unbundled RECs. Amazon said the usage of RECs allows it, and any other renewable energy purchaser, to account for energy it has bought, the company said in a 2024 blog post explaining how it reached its goal.

“No company with complex and growing operations is able today to only consume renewable energy — there simply aren’t enough sources in enough locations, and it takes a while for new projects to come online,” the blog said. “Like most companies with ambitious climate goals like ours, we also purchase RECs.”

Google said it first matched 100% of its operational electricity with renewable energy in 2017 by annually purchasing the same amount of renewable energy, through physical energy purchases and RECs, as it uses in megawatt-hours. The company also has a goal to run on 24/7 carbon-free energy on every grid it operates in by 2030 and reported reaching 70% hourly matching in the U.S. in 2024 in its latest sustainability report.

Meta also said in its most recent sustainability report it has maintained net-zero across its scope 1 and scope 2 emissions since 2020. The social media and tech conglomerate said it achieved that goal by becoming one of largest corporate procurers of renewable energy and making renewable procurement a key part of that strategy.

Microsoft has a goal to hit net-zero across its operations by 2025, which it plans to achieve through energy efficiency, decarbonization and reaching “100% direct renewable electricity by 2025,” according to a sustainability fact sheet. Microsoft said in the fact sheet it “procures enough renewable electricity to match 100% of our global electricity consumption” and, when it is unable to do so in markets it operates in, will look to purchase an equivalent volume of renewable electricity from nearby markets.

The world’s shipping regulator postponed a decision on adopting a landmark charge on vessel emissions, a shock move that highlights the Trump administration’s efforts to disrupt international climate diplomacy.

The postponement marks a setback for multilateral environmental regulations ahead of next month’s COP30 climate summit in Brazil.

Countries gathered at the International Maritime Organization’s London headquarters this week to decide on whether to make ships start paying for the more than 1 billion tons of greenhouse gases they emit each year. On Friday, they voted to push back that ballot for a year, following a proposal put forward by Saudi Arabia.

Industry insiders had previously expected the rules to pass, despite United States pressure. They’ve been years in the making, and would be the world’s first global, fixed charge on emissions for any industry. They would also pave the way for the end of oil as shipping’s dominant fuel and opened the door for cleaner alternatives like ammonia.

While the plan had clear international support back in April, that wavered this week as the U.S. dialed up pressure, threatening wide-ranging measures against those who backed the planned rules that President Donald Trump on Thursday said he was “outraged” about.

The International Chamber of Shipping, representing over 80 per cent of the world’s fleet, said it was disappointed with the result, and that uncertainty over the plan’s future threatens investments needed to make the sector cleaner.

US Pressure

The decision’s delay demonstrates the effect that pressure from the Trump administration can have. The U.S. strongly opposed the ship emissions charges, calling them a “global carbon tax” on Americans and warning of “disastrous” economic impacts. It had urged other nations to reject the regulations from “an unaccountable UN organization,” saying some estimates had forecast shipping costs to jump as much as 10 per cent or more.

The State Department had said it would consider measures such as port levies, visa restrictions, commercial penalties and sanctions on officials. It also previously mentioned tariffs as part of potential responses, though it became unclear if they remained on the table.

Trump said the U.S. wouldn’t adhere to the carbon tax “in any way, shape, or form,” and that he was “outraged” that the IMO was holding a vote.

The U.S. also put pressure on the plans this week by asking for another step in adopting the charge if countries voted in favour of it — proposing nations explicitly opt in after the vote in a shift from a “tacit acceptance” process. That would effectively add a further hurdle for them coming into force.

There were signs of wavering this week. Bloomberg reported Thursday that Athens, which had long been skeptical about the plan because of the impact on its maritime industry, was considering abstaining.

On Friday, Singapore — previously a supporter of the plan — proposed that nations delay voting on the charge. That was backed by Saudi Arabia, which was already against the rule.

Climate Impact

The plan’s failure is another example of the challenges that international climate diplomacy and regulation face. The Trump administration has been dismantling its domestic climate policy and attempting to disrupt efforts to cut emissions globally. Companies have also ditched climate commitments over the past year as the reality of meeting ambitious time frames becomes clear and the marketing benefits of having green credentials fade.

Though Trump has pulled the U.S. out of the Paris climate agreement, the withdrawal only takes formal effect in 2026. In practice, the U.S. will still be able to block efforts to reach consensus at the COP30 talks in November.

The maritime industry accounts for over four-fifths of the world’s trade and more than one per cent of all emissions, and the carbon levy was a key part of the IMO’s push for international shipping to reach net zero by around mid-century.

That goal now looks more difficult to achieve.

“We are disappointed that member states have not been able to agree a way forward at this meeting,” International Chamber of Shipping Secretary General Thomas Kazakos said in a statement. “Industry needs clarity to be able to make the investments needed to decarbonize the maritime sector, in line with the goals set out in the IMO GHG strategy.”

In this blog, we will address several common concerns about Proposition 4.
Moreover, this half of the funding would be split between the New Water Supply for Texas Fund and the State Water Implementation Fund for Texas (SWIFT).
To learn more about how to get engaged in regional planning, read our previous blogs about the State Water Plan and the State Flood Plan.
Proposition 4 would set up automatic deposits to the Texas Water Fund, which may limit legislative oversight, transparency, and adaptability to emergencies.","Proposition 4, which is set to appear on the ballot this fall, proposes a constitutional amendment that would allocate $1 billion annually to the Texas Water Fund starting in 2027 and through 2047. This proposition has sparked both hope and concern for Texas’ water future. In this blog, we will address several common concerns about Proposition 4.

At least half of the annual funding will be directed to controversial new water supply projects.

Proposition 4 allows funding for a wide range of new water supply projects, some of which raise serious concerns for public health and the environment - like oil and gas wastewater reuse and seawater desalination projects. However, this proposition also makes funding available for sustainable new water supply projects, such as aquifer storage and recovery (ASR) and water and wastewater reuse. Moreover, this half of the funding would be split between the New Water Supply for Texas Fund and the State Water Implementation Fund for Texas (SWIFT). The SWIFT funds regionally approved projects listed in the State Water Plan, which include many sustainable solutions like water conservation, water infrastructure improvements, nature-based solutions, and others. With at least part of this portion of the funding tied to projects approved by Texas communities, the potential for positive impact is real - but only if Texans come together to advocate for the money to be directed away from controversial projects.

Proposition 4 would make it easier to advance controversial projects like the Marvin Nichols Reservoir, water transfer from East Texas, and expansion of seawater desalination.

Proposition 4 does not favor any specific type of project, nor does it establish criteria for how projects will be prioritized. This makes public participation critically important. Much of the decision-making will happen through regional planning groups and TWDB established processes, which are open to the public. We encourage people to attend TWDB’s public meetings and get involved in regional water planning, where Texans help determine which projects move forward and best serve the needs of their communities. To learn more about how to get engaged in regional planning, read our previous blogs about the State Water Plan and the State Flood Plan. The more Texans speak up, the harder it is to ignore community needs and push political or industry agendas.

Funding allocation decisions will rest with the Texas Water Development Board (TWDB), which includes governor-appointed members.

We understand the concern that funding allocation decisions could be politically driven. That’s why public participation and advocacy are critically important - especially if Proposition 4 passes. It’s important to remember that many projects must go through established processes like public meetings, hearings, and comment periods, offering opportunities for community input. If Texans show up and speak up, the outcomes can change. The recent stalling of the Inner Harbor seawater desalination plant in Corpus Christi is an excellent example how public involvement can drive the desired change, even in the face of pressure from special interests and the support from the governor. For our part, we will continue to monitor how funds are allocated, attend public meetings, and engage with agencies like TWDB and TCEQ to ensure transparency and accountability.

Proposition 4 would set up automatic deposits to the Texas Water Fund, which may limit legislative oversight, transparency, and adaptability to emergencies.

Proposition 4 brings a long-term funding stream, but it doesn’t lock the Texas Legislature out. The automatic transfer simply creates predictable funding. The Legislature must still pass a budget bill every two years to authorize the appropriations. An additional provision outlined in the House Joint Resolution 7 (HJR 7) - from which Proposition 4 has resulted - allows the Legislature to temporarily suspend deposits during a declared state of disaster, thus giving the state flexibility to respond to emergencies. To ensure transparency in the spending process, the enabling legislation - Senate Bill 7 (SB 7) - established the Texas Water Fund Advisory Committee, composed of legislators and agency representatives, to oversee spending and make recommendations that keep investments transparent and aligned with the state’s water needs. In addition, the Legislature is free to make additional appropriations beyond the $1 billion to address specific needs or even projects if money is available from state or federal revenues.

Proposition 4 may take money away from other priorities.

Proposition 4 doesn’t raise taxes or take money away from existing priorities, like transportation or education. It uses surplus state sales tax revenue, money that’s only allocated once collections exceed $46.5 billion in a given year. In other words, this is extra money that the state already has, and Proposition 4 would direct $1 billion each year to water needs.

But the workers responsible for carrying out the president’s plans for more fossil fuels and less wind and solar power are still hard at work. Some are approving permits for companies that want to extract metals, coal, oil and gas from public lands and federal waters. Others are rolling back limits on the greenhouse gas emissions that are driving climate change.

On Thursday the Bureau of Land Management approved the expansion of a copper mine on public land in Utah. Earlier this week the Interior Department prepared to open more than 250,000 acres of land in Wyoming and Nebraska to oil drilling, and held a coal lease sale for access to Montana’s Powder River Basin. And at the Environmental Protection Agency, employees are finalizing a plan to allow more mercury emissions from coal plants, according to two people familiar with the work underway.

Charlotte Taylor, a spokeswoman for the Interior Department, said the agency was doing what was necessary in light of President Trump’s declaration in January of a national energy emergency.

“Work related to permitting, leasing and other essential energy operations is continuing as excepted work to help strengthen the nation’s energy security, maintain reliable supplies and protect American consumers from disruption,” Ms. Taylor said.

Most experts say that there is no national energy emergency, pointing to record amounts of oil and gas that is being produced in the United States. Electricity demand, however, is on the rise, driven largely by the explosion of data centers as well as population growth and the rise of artificial intelligence applications. At the same time, the Trump administration has been trying to slow or stop the expansion of renewable energy that could add to the nation’s electricity supply.

“If this is truly about keeping the lights on, then why suppress the cleanest and cheapest energy that’s coming online?” said Alexandra Adams, chief policy advocacy officer for the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group.

The continuation of work on fossil fuel projects during the shutdown is both legal and appropriate, said Rachel Cauley, a spokeswoman for the Office of Management and Budget.

“Approving energy development is no different than keeping open national parks — it can be done to the extent funds are available and at some point money will run out,” Ms. Cauley said. She blamed Democrats for the shutdown, which she said has forced Mr. Trump “to pick and choose which programs to fund with the dwindling dollars that remain carried over from last year.”

Mr. Trump “is showing us exactly who and what matters to him, which is industry executives and his political allies,” said Stephanie Kurose, deputy director of government affairs at the Center for Biological Diversity, an environmental group.

At the Energy Department, nearly 200 employees were told last week that their jobs were being eliminated. At the same time, department employees approved a plan to improve electric transmission lines across Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Oklahoma and West Virginia.

Most Environmental Protection Agency employees have been working through the shutdown. Union officials believe the agency has been able to do that by tapping into appropriated funds that have carried over from the previous funding period, but E.P.A. officials have declined to answer questions about what money they are using or how long it will last.

Employees working on weakening or repealing regulations that the Trump administration has called burdensome to oil, gas and coal companies have been told to press on, according to two E.P.A. officials who asked not to be named because they were not authorized to discuss agency work. One regulation nearing completion would loosen power plant limits on emissions of mercury, a neurotoxin that impairs brain development, the two officials said.

Brigit Hirsch, a spokeswoman for the E.P.A., said in a statement that the agency is continuing to fulfill legal obligations, meet emergency response and work on administration priorities.

“We are unwavering in our commitment to our mission of providing clean air, clean land, and clean water for all Americans,” she said. “Moreover, we’ll continue to dismantle the Biden Administration’s wasteful and costly agenda.”

And the Interior Department has furloughed about half of its 58,600 employees but exempted those who permit fossil fuel and mining projects on public lands and in federal waters. On Thursday it announced it had approved an expansion of the copper mining operations at the Lisbon Valley Copper Mine in San Juan County, Utah.

The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, which oversees offshore energy development, “will cease all renewable energy activities” during the shutdown, according to a copy of the bureau’s plan. But its plan calls for using carry-over funds to keep employees working on “priority conventional energy projects,” including offshore drilling permits and a five-year plan for selling drilling leases along the outer continental shelf.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/17/multimedia/17cli-shutdown-htcl/17cli-shutdown-htcl-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-10-17 14:10:32.686701

The Delivering on the UAE Consensus progress report, unveiled at a pre-COP30 high-level event in Brasília, finds that while 2024 saw an unprecedented 582 gigawatts (GW) of renewable energy added globally, the pace remains far short of what is needed to meet the COP28 UAE Consensus goal of tripling renewables capacity to 11.2 terawatts (TW) by 2030.

To stay on track, the world must now add a staggering 1,122 GW of new renewable capacity each year from 2025 onwards — requiring annual growth to accelerate to 16.6% throughout the remainder of the decade.

Energy efficiency progress is equally off pace. The report shows that global energy intensity improved by just 1% in 2024, well below the 4% annual improvement required to meet the UAE Consensus goal of doubling efficiency by 2030 and keeping the 1.5°C target within reach.

Urgent Call for Action

The report urges governments to integrate renewable targets into their national climate plans (NDC 3.0) ahead of COP30 in Belém, double their collective ambition to align with global goals, and significantly increase renewable investment. Between 2025 and 2030, at least USD 1.4 trillion in annual investment will be needed — more than twice the USD 624 billion recorded in 2024,

G20 nations, which are expected to account for over 80% of global renewables by 2030, are called upon to take the lead. The report highlights that G7 countries, in particular, must boost their share to around 20% of global capacity by the end of the decade while delivering on international climate finance commitments.

That includes meeting the new collective quantified goal (NCQG) of USD 300 billion per year and scaling up towards the aspirational USD 1.3 trillion figure confirmed at COP29 in Azerbaijan.

Beyond Renewables: Grids, Supply Chains, and Clean Tech

The report also stresses the urgent need to expand and modernise electricity grids, strengthen renewable supply chains, and scale clean-tech manufacturing in areas such as solar, wind, batteries, and hydrogen.

While renewable investment grew 7% in 2024, actual disbursements remain well below what is needed to sustain project pipelines and accelerate deployment. IRENA and its partners warn that fair and transparent trade practices must be secured for key materials and technologies to ensure stable supply chains.

Haustveit oversees Fossil Energy and National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) programs and manages a $5 billion research development portfolio that includes coal, oil, natural gas and critical minerals with the objective of advancing affordable and reliable energy solutions, according to the Department of Energy.
“Without more energy and without more reliable energy, America will face an energy disaster with affordability and reliability issues unlike anything we’ve experienced since the advent of electricity,” he said.
“As we improve our grid, we are committed to loading it with record supplies of reliable energy, including coal, nuclear and natural gas.
Make no mistake, the prior administration’s war on coal and neglect of nuclear energy are over,” he said.","The U.S. will need more reliable energy sources than ever before and the Trump administration will deliver, an assistant secretary at the U.S. Department of Energy said at a summit Thursday.

The Louisiana Energy Security Summit 2025 in New Orleans featured U.S. Sen. Bill Cassidy along with keynote speaker Kyle Haustveit and brought 70 thought leaders from around the country to discuss the state’s role in advancing U.S. energy dominance in the face of evolving global challenges.

“The president and our administration are determined to unleash greater energy production than ever before, utilizing every reliable energy source at our disposal,” said Haustveit, assistant secretary for Fossil Energy Department Management in the U.S. Department of Energy.

“And as we do this, we will unleash unparalleled prosperity across our nation, including this region,” said Haustveit, who addressed the summit by video because of the federal government shutdown.

Haustveit oversees Fossil Energy and National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) programs and manages a $5 billion research development portfolio that includes coal, oil, natural gas and critical minerals with the objective of advancing affordable and reliable energy solutions, according to the Department of Energy.

Haustveit said the previous administration pursued an anti-energy policy. “It restrained both energy production and the building of energy infrastructure such as natural gas pipelines.”

America needs both more energy and more energy diversity, said Haustveit, a North Dakota native whose family has worked in the energy industry for three generations.

“Thanks to the accelerating march of innovation and progress, including the president’s manufacturing revival and the coming rise in AI data center growth, a tidal wave of energy demand is headed our way and is about to wash over this nation and indeed the world,” Haustveit said.

Haustveit said the Energy Department’s Florence Berkeley National Lab estimated last year that data center demand for energy will double or triple by 2028. “The kind of energy we will need for these data centers will be rock solid energy that delivers 24-7 reliability. In other words, if we want to power these data centers and reindustrialize our country, we not only need more energy supply, we also need more energy diversity.,” said Haustveit.

“The United States needs to develop the most reliable energy sources on the planet, including coal and nuclear, oil and natural gas,” said Haustveit. “Without more energy and without more reliable energy, America will face an energy disaster with affordability and reliability issues unlike anything we’ve experienced since the advent of electricity,” he said.

Haustveit said Secretary of Energy Chris Wright has responded to the crisis by issuing eight emergency orders pursuant to Section 202c of the Federal Powers Act that have strengthened grid reliability during peak demand to prevent power outages and saved consumers at least $4.7 million in energy costs.

“We’re looking for stakeholder input on how best to utilize our funding programs and authorities to rapidly expand energy generation and transmission grid capacity,” the assistant secretary said. “As we improve our grid, we are committed to loading it with record supplies of reliable energy, including coal, nuclear and natural gas. Given the AI revolution alone and the coming surge in consumption, there is clearly no alternative to the pro energy course we are taking,” said Haustveit.

Haustveit said Energy Department leadership team has identified 16 potential sites at national labs and other DOE-owned land for AI data center development.

“We support removing regulations that constrain AI development, and we are unleashing DOE resources and the innovation of our national labs to ensure we have the resources to power the AI revolution. But again, none of this can be sustained without an unprecedented surge in energy supply,” said Haustveit.

Haustveit said the department is laser focused on fulfilling the president’s mandates on nuclear energy. He said the focus is on enabling the rapid deployment and export of next generation nuclear technology, bringing down operating costs for existing reactors, expanding the application of nuclear energy beyond electricity to support manufacturing and industry, strengthening nuclear fuel infrastructure, restarting reactors that were prematurely closed, and cutting regulations that have stifled the industry.

“Streamlining the permitting process will ensure nuclear developers get steel in the ground faster,” Hustveit said. “As vice chair of the new National Energy Dominance Council, Secretary Wright is working closely with the chair, Interior Secretary [Doug] Burgum, and other council members to unleash American energy through permitting reform. Make no mistake, the prior administration’s war on coal and neglect of nuclear energy are over,” he said.

Haustveit said the administration will also “unleash” another base load resource, natural gas.

“We are on the cusp of an LNG revolution that will fill the world with our LNG bounty. Several of the LNG export authorizations processed during the first Trump administration have now become actual exports, including the Plaquemines LNG project right here in Louisiana that has just come online,” said Haustveit.

Hospitality workers won a number of major victories including a $20/hour minimum wage—with increases that will bring workers to $22/hour by the end of the contract—job security protections, improved housekeeping workloads and improved safety standards. “This victory is an attestation of our members’ strength, their will, and determination. They held the line for over a month in the heat and rain, as they fought to secure better standards after being left behind for so long. It was an incredibly hard fight, and the outcome reflects just that. Now we expect all the players in Houston’s hospitality industry to follow suit and pay workers a living wage,” said Franchesca Caraballo, Texas Chapter President of Local 23.

Michigan Home Care Workers Win Election to Join SEIU: On Thursday, 32,000 home care workers voted to form a union with SEIU Healthcare Michigan, 13 years after former Gov. Rick Snyder ripped away their collective bargaining rights by reclassifying them. The current governor of Michigan, Gretchen Whitmer, reversed her predecessor’s attack on these workers last year, paving the way for them to fight for the wages and benefits they deserve. “This is a proud day for Michigan. If anyone needs a union, it’s home care workers. When the union was stolen from us, I was devastated. But I didn’t lose hope. I knew we would reclaim our union one day—and that day has finally come.” said Phyllis Pride, a home care worker from Ecorse. “This all happened because we took a stand: home care workers and the people we care for deserve better.

Sutter Health Workers Secure New Tentative Agreement: More than 4,700 SEIU-United Healthcare Workers West (SEIU-UHW) members at eight Sutter Health facilities across Northern California have successfully leveraged a major strike threat to reach a tentative agreement on their new contract. Nursing assistants, respiratory therapists, environmental services, food services, x-ray technicians, respiratory therapists and other essential staff voted overwhelmingly earlier this month to authorize a work stoppage in response to bad faith bargaining from Sutter executives. The power of their unity paid off, and members will now vote on a deal that includes wins like a 14% across-the-board raise, protections for health care and retirement benefits, and more. “This tentative agreement shows that when we stand united, we can win improvements that protect both healthcare workers and our patients,” said Dinora Garcia, a dietary clerk from Sutter Lakeside Hospital in Lakeport. “Reaching this agreement wasn’t easy but we stood together to advocate for worker and patient safety, improved staffing levels, and fair wages and benefits that reflect the vital work we do every day.”

At 3.99%, the newest versions of the Model S and Model X now have the same interest rates as the 2026 Tesla Model Y.
However, our analysis found that 2026 Tesla Model S and Model X lease prices remain completely unchanged.
Tesla raised MSRPs on both the Model S and Model X back in August by roughly $10,000.","Tesla lowered interest rates today on the Model S and Model X to as low as 3.99% APR. It's the most significant change since federal tax credits ended on September 30. While this isn't the best Tesla financing deal that we've ever seen, our analysis found that it could translate to a nearly $4,000 price cut for some EV buyers.

But The Financing Deal Has A Catch

Starting today, all 2026 Tesla Model S and Model X configurations are eligible for 3.99% APR for 72 months. Like past financing deals from Tesla, the catch is that you'll need to make a down payment to get the advertised interest rate. Currently, that's 3% of the purchase price. So on a $100,000 vehicle, that would be $3,000.

With a zero-down loan, the interest rate changes to 4.99%. Both rates are lower than the previous one of 5.14% APR, though the 3.99% deal clearly offers the biggest savings. On a $100,000 vehicle, today's change could translate to a roughly $3,700 price cut, assuming a buyer puts down the 3% minimum down payment.

We've Seen Better Incentives From Tesla

Having said that, we've seen better deals from Tesla. The most competitive offers have involved 0% financing, free FSD, and free Supercharging. However, today's change is far more moderate in our view. At 3.99%, the newest versions of the Model S and Model X now have the same interest rates as the 2026 Tesla Model Y.

For some buyers, we think today's interest rate drops could make it a good time to buy. However, our analysis found that 2026 Tesla Model S and Model X lease prices remain completely unchanged. The cheapest Model S lease has an effective cost of just over $2,000 a month, while the Model X lease comes in at over $2,300.

Both EVs are significantly more expensive after tax credits changed on October 1. While neither one qualified for the credit on purchases, they did take advantage of a $7,500 Commercial Clean Vehicle Credit that made leases more affordable. This month's elimination of the credit caused lease prices to surge up to $242 per month.

Tesla raised MSRPs on both the Model S and Model X back in August by roughly $10,000. The price hikes were largely the result of the inclusion of the standard Luxe Package with benefits like Full Self-Driving and Supercharging. At the time, our analysis found that Tesla's lease prices also increased by approximately 20%.

Her letter also noted that the “delay in issuing the PFNA report coincided with EPA’s decision, in May of this year, to rescind” drinking water limits for PFNA and several other forever chemicals, also known as PFAS.
“This seems to be more than coincidence given that there has been strong industry pushback on regulating PFAS,” Pingree wrote.
“Reading that piece made my blood boil.” Background: PFNA is in drinking water systems serving some 26 million people.
Although it was subject to a voluntary phaseout almost two decades ago, the chemical is now widespread in the environment.","What Happened: The ranking member of a key House subcommittee demanded answers this week from the Environmental Protection Agency about why it has yet to make public a report documenting the health risks posed by a forever chemical found in the water of millions of Americans.

In a letter sent to the EPA on Thursday, Rep. Chellie Pingree, D-Maine, cited a ProPublica story from last week that quoted government scientists saying the report had been ready for publishing in April but had yet to be released. Pingree — the top Democrat on the Appropriations Committee’s Subcommittee on the Interior, Environment and Related Agencies — asked EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin for “clear answers” about why the report had not been made public, who directed its delay and when Zeldin would commit to releasing it.

What They Said: Pingree referred to the delay in publishing the report as part of “a growing pattern of interference with the Agency’s scientific work” and pointed to the Integrated Risk Information System, the EPA program that wrote it. IRIS, which was created during Ronald Reagan’s presidency, analyzes the health harm chemicals can cause. “The Trump Administration, Republicans in Congress, and industry have been hostile to the IRIS program,” she wrote, asking whether scientists had been removed or reassigned from the program and, if so, why.

Her letter also noted that the “delay in issuing the PFNA report coincided with EPA’s decision, in May of this year, to rescind” drinking water limits for PFNA and several other forever chemicals, also known as PFAS. “This seems to be more than coincidence given that there has been strong industry pushback on regulating PFAS,” Pingree wrote.

Pingree noted that the delay appears to contradict Zeldin’s repeated public statements about protecting the public from PFAS compounds, which contaminate soil and water in Maine and throughout the country. “Our state is really hoping for help from the federal government. And when you see the federal government turn their back on you and decide to withhold the data … that’s really discouraging,” she told ProPublica. “Reading that piece made my blood boil.”

Background: PFNA is in drinking water systems serving some 26 million people. The report in question found that the chemical interferes with human development by causing lower birth weights and, based on animal evidence, likely causes damage to the liver and to male reproductive systems, including reductions in testosterone levels, sperm production and the size of reproductive organs.

PFNA was a component of firefighting foam and a processing aid to make a kind of plastic used in circuit boards, valves and pipes. Although it was subject to a voluntary phaseout almost two decades ago, the chemical is now widespread in the environment.

ProPublica’s reporting found that IRIS has been drastically reduced under the Trump administration. The program, which calculates values that can be used to set limits for pollutants in drinking water and cleanup levels for toxic sites, has been a frequent target of industry. Project 2025, the conservative blueprint that has set the direction for President Donald Trump’s second administration, called for IRIS to be eliminated. Earlier this year, Republicans in Congress introduced legislation called the “No IRIS Act.” Of 55 EPA scientists Publica identified as having worked on recent IRIS assessments, only eight remain in the office, according to a source familiar with the program.

Why It Matters: The report calculated the amount of PFNA that people can be exposed to without being harmed — a critical measurement that can be used to set limits for cleaning up PFNA in contaminated areas called Superfund sites and for removing the chemical from drinking water. This calculation will prove critical to communities around the country as they battle polluters over who will pay to remove PFNA and other forever chemicals from the environment.",https://img.assets-d.propublica.org/v5/images/AP22313127406391_maxHeight_3000_maxWidth_3000.jpg?crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&imgixProfile=propublicaAssetsV5&q=90&w=1200&s=f9f15155da7a44eeb89cd7f2e01f3d09,N,,2025-10-17 14:11:02.736112

Minneapolis-based Xcel Energy, which generates and distributes electricity and gas to customers across eight states, seeks proposals for power generation projects to increase the capacity of its Texas-New Mexico electric system.

The company said Oct. 10 it’s working to meet the forecasted increase in demand, as well as the needs of the growing regional economy.

“For more than a century, we’ve had the privilege of powering the growth of this region and supporting the communities and industries that call it home,” said Adrian J. Rodriguez, president of Xcel Energy Texas–New Mexico. “As economic activity continues to expand, we’re planning ahead to ensure we can meet our customers’ growing energy needs with reliable, cost-effective service and a balanced approach to our energy future.”

Xcel on Oct. 10 filed a request for proposals (RFP), opening the competitive bidding process for all sources of new power projects to add more than 2,000 megawatts to the system when those sources are operating at their intended design capacity.

The Texas-New Mexico RFP seeks resources to meet identified power needs from 2030 through 2032, the company said.

“Industries can’t grow without power, so we are taking an all-of-the-above approach to new generation projects,” Rodriguez said. “This process is the first step toward powering new jobs and supporting continued economic growth in our region.”

Xcel Energy operates a diverse mix of power generation facilities in its Texas–New Mexico service area, including conventional power generating stations and large-scale wind installations. The region’s energy mix also includes electricity supplied through power purchase agreements.

The company said it’s working with an independent monitor appointed by state regulators to ensure the design and execution of the RFP is fair, competitive, and transparent.

In addition to the need to increase generating capacity, the company also seeks proposals for projects that will provide renewable energy credits to meet New Mexico Renewable Portfolio Standard requirements, as well as projects that may lower costs or improve service to its customers.

Bids from developers are due by Jan. 13, 2026. All documents and guidance for submission may be found online.

Xcel Energy will evaluate submissions with proposed commercial operation dates before June 2032 and said it expects to file a bid evaluation report and recommended portfolio to the New Mexico Public Regulation Commission for review in the second quarter of 2026.

The attorneys general of more than a dozen states on Thursday sued the Trump administration over the termination of $7 billion in funding intended for affordable solar energy projects across the U.S.

The coalition, which also included the District of Columbia and other stakeholders, argued in the lawsuit that the Environmental Protection Agency’s cancellation of the Solar for All program violated the law governing federal agencies and the constitutional separation of powers. The program was introduced in 2022 as part of former President Joe Biden’s landmark climate law, intended to make the renewable energy accessible to nearly 1 million Americans.

Increasing the use of solar energy reduces reliance on coal, oil and natural gas. Burning these fossil fuels for electricity is a primary driver of climate change globally because they emit greenhouse gases that trap the Earth’s heat.

The EPA rescinded the Solar for All funds in August after President Donald Trump’s massive tax and spending law passed in Congress a month earlier, with Administrator Lee Zeldin calling the program a “boondoggle.”

The EPA said in an email Thursday that it does not comment on pending litigation.

Thursday’s filing in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington was led by Washington Attorney General Nick Brown, Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison and Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes, and argues the termination of the funding was unlawful. It names the EPA and Zeldin as defendants.

RELATED: Regulators know PG&amp;E, Edison are slow to hook up solar. Why are there no penalties?

Joining the lawsuit are the attorneys general in California, Colorado, Connecticut, the District of Columbia, Hawaii, Illinois, Massachusetts, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island and Vermont, all of whom are Democrats, as well as the governor of Kentucky, the chair of the Pennsylvania Energy Development Authority, and the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation.

“Congress passed a solar energy program to help make electricity costs more affordable, but the administration is ignoring the law and focused on the conspiracy theory that climate change is a hoax,” Brown said in a statement.

Advocates have touted the program not only for its benefits to lower-income communities needing access to money for clean-energy projects, but also for local workforces and to keep electricity prices reasonable.

“At a time when energy bills are at a record high and only continuing to skyrocket, the Trump Administration is needlessly hampering an industry that can produce safe, reliable, and inexpensive energy,” California Attorney General Rob Bonta said in a statement.

A similar group of states filed a separate lawsuit Wednesday in the Court of Federal Claims against the Trump administration arguing that the program funding cancellation is a breach of contract and said they are seeking to recover monetary damages.

This week’s litigation ramps up the pressure on the Trump administration over the program. Nonprofit organizations and other groups sued over Solar for All funding for similar reasoning earlier this month, and Harris County in Texas filed a lawsuit last week over its award. More than two dozen Democratic senators also wrote a letter to Zeldin this week calling for the program to be restored.

Solar for All was affiliated with another $20 billion in green funding, formally known as the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, terminated by the Trump administration in March.

The canceled $27 billion is just one example of the efforts the administration has taken against clean energy. Trump has invested in fossil fuels such as oil, natural gas and coal while slashing climate regulation, standing in the way of clean energy developments and reversing environmental policy.

Lifecyle audit challenges in power grid projects As power-grid projects escalate in scale and complexity, traditional auditing approaches struggle to address the multifaceted challenges of modern infrastructure development.
The research focused on managing power-grid projects and controlling risks throughout the project lifecycle, using 29 completed power-grid projects in 2023 as the primary empirical context.
The power-grid projects were located across different geographical areas within Jiangsu Province, including urban centers, suburban regions, and rural areas.
Challenges and achievements of the LAud framework The case study on implementing the LAud framework at State Grid Jiangsu Electric Power Company faced several challenges.","Lifecycle auditing

The concept of LAud emerged as an extension of continuous auditing (CA), building upon foundational work by Groomer and Murthy16 and Vasarhelyi and Halper17. While early definitions of CA focused on financial reporting, LAud broadens this scope to encompass holistic project oversight. Rezaee et al.18 described CA as a systematic process for gathering electronic audit evidence to evaluate financial statements in real-time systems, a foundation that LAud expands by integrating cross-functional operational data. Eulerich and Kalinichenko19 framed CA as an automated monitoring system for detecting deviations from standards, a concept LAud extends to track multidimensional performance metrics across project lifecycles. In power-grid engineering contexts, LAud leverages advanced technology to enhance the timeliness and accuracy of financial and operational reporting, detect errors and fraud, and provide actionable insights for decision-making11,12,20. This evolution addresses the limitations of traditional risk management methods in power-grid projects, which often lack robust evaluation frameworks13.

Auditors now face demands for real-time assurance not only over financial data but also operational integrity, requiring continuous assessment of control systems for anomalies and risks21,22. Traditional auditing methodologies, designed for periodic reviews, struggle to meet these dynamic requirements23. LAud overcomes these constraints by enabling concurrent monitoring of project schedules, budgets, quality benchmarks, and risk indicators throughout the asset lifecycle24. In power-grid projects, this facilitates immediate corrective actions and proactive risk mitigation through data integration from project management software, financial systems, and operational logs. The principles of LAud build upon those articulated for CA25,26, enhanced for lifecycle applications27. These include:

High-frequency audit cycles aligned with project milestones.

Automated monitoring of technical, financial, and operational parameters.

Exception-based auditing supplemented by human expertise for complex judgments.

Integration of predictive analytics for risk identification in engineering workflows.

Real-time assurance over both financial and non-financial performance indicators.

Continuous data modeling using inputs from IoT sensors, ERP systems, and maintenance records.

As a technology-dependent methodology, LAud requires sophisticated tools for implementation. Auditors employ computer-assisted audit techniques to analyze heterogeneous data streams, assess risks, and validate compliance across project phases28. Successful deployment depends on secure integration with client systems for installing monitoring modules, collecting evidence, and generating alerts29. In power-grid contexts, this necessitates interoperability with specialized engineering platforms and Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems. Critical success factors include executive sponsorship, mature IT infrastructure, adaptive internal audit structures, and workforce upskilling in both audit principles and engineering operations26,30.

The implementation of LAud is particularly valuable in addressing the complex risk landscape of power-grid projects. Effective lifecycle risk management requires integrated systems capable of processing technical, environmental, and financial data streams—a capability inherent in LAud frameworks13. Adoption success depends on technological readiness, regulatory alignment, and organizational culture30,31. Recent studies highlight LAud’s growing relevance in critical infrastructure sectors, where it enhances resilience through continuous compliance monitoring and predictive analytics12,32.

Audit of power grid projects

The audit of power grid projects constitutes a critical mechanism for ensuring operational efficiency, regulatory compliance, and sustainable development in the energy sector. Various dimensions of power-grid auditing emphasize the integration of technical and financial oversight33, while the role of energy audits in optimizing household electricity consumption in Amman, Jordan—a framework adaptable to broader distribution network efficiency34. Zhou et al.35 advanced risk assessment methodologies through a two-layer neural network model capable of processing multi-attribute, low-correlation data, addressing a key challenge in auditing complex infrastructure projects.

LAud extends these foundations by embedding continuous, technology-driven oversight across all project phases. Abdel-Hadi et al.36 laid groundwork for this approach through a holistic audit framework that synthesizes financial, technical, and operational metrics—principles now operationalized in LAud through real-time data integration from SCADA systems, IoT sensors, and project management platforms. Energy performance indicators gain enhanced relevance in LAud frameworks37, where they are dynamically tracked against evolving benchmarks. Early innovations in automation, such as intelligent auditing system38, foreshadowed LAud’s reliance on artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning to minimize human error and accelerate anomaly detection33,39,40.

Diverging from prior literature, this research investigates the implementation of LAud based on a full lifecycle model that integrates:

Design-phase risk forecasting using predictive analytics.

Construction-phase compliance tracking via IoT-enabled progress monitoring.

Operational-phase resilience auditing through SCADA system interoperability.

Post-completion performance evaluation with machine learning-driven benchmarks.

This framework is underpinned by collaborative digital ecosystems that unify stakeholders—engineers, auditors, and policymakers—on shared data platforms. By demonstrating LAud’s capacity to synchronize technical specifications (e.g., substation load thresholds) with financial constraints (e.g., budget allocations), our work addresses a critical gap identified by Bosu et al. (2023)41 in aligning engineering priorities with fiscal accountability. Furthermore, the study elucidates how LAud’s proactive risk identification mechanisms, leveraging AI-augmented analysis of operational logs and environmental data, mitigate the systemic vulnerabilities in power transmission systems13.

Lifecyle audit challenges in power grid projects

As power-grid projects escalate in scale and complexity, traditional auditing approaches struggle to address the multifaceted challenges of modern infrastructure development. These challenges underscore the imperative for adopting LAud frameworks that integrate continuous monitoring and predictive analytics.

Current practices disproportionately focus on post-completion financial reviews, neglecting critical front-end nodes such as design validation, procurement oversight, and contractor selection35. This fragmented approach fails to detect risks embedded in early project phases, such as design flaws or bid-rigging, which later manifest as cost overruns or operational failures13. LAud addresses this gap through real-time monitoring of all lifecycle stages, leveraging IoT-enabled progress tracking and predictive modeling to identify deviations during design and construction25. For instance, SCADA system interoperability allows auditors to validate equipment specifications against live operational data, ensuring alignment between design intent and implementation36.

Audit findings often remain siloed within departmental boundaries, lacking integration with strategic decision-making processes. This disconnection stems from inadequate digital infrastructure to disseminate insights across engineering, finance, and risk management teams26. LAud transforms audit outcomes into actionable intelligence by deploying centralized digital platforms that automate report generation and distribute findings to stakeholders in real time. Machine learning algorithms33 enable predictive risk scoring, allowing preemptive interventions in procurement or contractor performance. Furthermore, blockchain-based audit trails32, enhance transparency in corrective action tracking, addressing the feedback loop deficiencies41.

Last but not least, the exponential growth of audit scope—spanning environmental compliance, cybersecurity, and supply chain ethics—has strained traditional audit teams39. While outsourcing to intermediaries temporarily alleviates resource shortages, it introduces governance gaps, such as inconsistent data standards and misaligned incentives12. LAud mitigates these issues through digitalization-driven automation, reducing manual workloads by 40–60% in routine compliance checks40. For example, natural language processing tools audit contractual documents against regulatory databases, while computer vision systems validate construction milestones via drone-captured imagery. This shift enables internal teams to focus on high-value tasks like fraud pattern analysis and resilience stress-testing, aligning with the proactive risk culture30.

By transitioning from reactive compliance checks to a lifecycle assurance model, power-grid enterprises can reduce project risks at early stages, as evidenced by pilot implementations in state-owned utilities37,38. This evolution positions LAud not merely as an audit methodology but as a cornerstone of sustainable infrastructure governance.

This study employed a qualitative case study approach to investigate the implementation of a full-process LAud model within a state-owned organization’s internal audit framework. The research focused on managing power-grid projects and controlling risks throughout the project lifecycle, using 29 completed power-grid projects in 2023 as the primary empirical context. This case study design was selected to enable an in-depth exploration of the LAud framework’s operational dynamics and its alignment with audit needs throughout the project lifecycle.

Data collection and analysis

The primary data were collected through two methods, namely, document analysis and expert interviews. Regarding the document analysis, a purposive sample of the completed power-grid projects was selected based on their relevance to the LAud framework’s implementation. Internal audit reports, project records, and post-audit evaluations were systematically reviewed to identify patterns in governance practices, digital tool utilization, and audit outcomes42. Meanwhile, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 11 stakeholders, including internal auditors, project managers, IT specialists, and senior executives involved in the power-grid company as shown in Table 1. Interviews focused on validating the framework’s efficacy, uncovering challenges in collaborative governance, and evaluating the role of digital tools in enhancing audit transparency and efficiency.

The interviewees were selected purposively to capture audit perspectives from the 29 completed power-grid projects. Selection criteria for these interviewees were (a) direct involvement in at least one of the completed power-grid projects and (b) functional role in internal audit, project management, IT systems, or executive oversight, and with a minimum of five years’ experience. Recruitment continued until thematic saturation was reached—no new concepts emerged after the ninth interview, and two confirmatory interviews were added, yielding the final sample of 11 stakeholders.

Thematic analysis was then applied to documentary and interview data. Iterative code development focused on project lifecycle stages. Interview transcripts were triangulated with project documentation for consistency and reliability. Emerging patterns were mapped to the LAud framework’s theoretical foundations, with discrepancies resolved through research team discussions.

Case study context, LAud framework Implementation, and digital platform development

The study was conducted at State Grid Jiangsu Electric Power Company, a prominent provincial power grid company within the State Grid Corporation of China. This state-owned enterprise was deliberately chosen because such organizations are both the dominant investors in China’s power-grid infrastructure and subject to stringent public-sector auditing standards, thereby providing a high-stakes, high-visibility environment in which the benefits and constraints of a full-process LAud model can be rigorously examined and transparently validated. This company plays a crucial role in the region’s energy infrastructure, overseeing 13 municipal and 59 county-level branches, and serving a substantial customer base of over 50.77 million. In 2023, the company successfully completed 29 power-grid projects, which provided a rich empirical context for developing and testing the LAud framework.

The power-grid projects were located across different geographical areas within Jiangsu Province, including urban centers, suburban regions, and rural areas. This geographical diversity posed unique challenges in terms of environmental conditions, land acquisition, and coordination with local stakeholders. For instance, projects in urban areas had to navigate complex underground utility networks and meet higher safety and environmental standards, while rural projects faced challenges related to transportation of materials and limited local infrastructure support.

The company operates in a highly regulated and dynamic environment, with increasing demands for power supply reliability and quality. It faces intense competition in the electricity market and growing expectations from customers and regulators regarding project cost-effectiveness, environmental sustainability, and social responsibility. These factors made the power-grid projects not only technically challenging but also strategically critical for the company’s long-term development and reputation.

The successful completion of these projects was essential for enhancing the power supply capacity, improving grid stability, and supporting the economic growth of the region. However, the projects also carried significant risks, such as cost overruns, schedule delays, and quality issues, which necessitated effective governance and risk control mechanisms.

Against this backdrop, the study proposed a holistic LAud framework covering six critical stages of power-grid projects’ lifecycle after expert verification: Project Initiation, Survey and Design, Bidding, Tendering and Procurement, Implementation of Engineering Project, Engineering Completion, and Post-Completion Audit.

Throughout the pilot program, the company developed a new workflow to streamline the audit process. This workflow incorporated the principles of the LAud framework and emphasized mid-process and pre-process engagement. It involved various stages, from audit planning and implementation to reporting and follow-up, ensuring continuous tracking and on-site audits throughout the construction process.

Post-pilot, a fully functional digital LAud platform was developed to support the implementation of the LAud framework. This platform enhanced off-site data analysis for engineering audits, characterized by “full-volume scanning, precise positioning, systematic analysis, and focused verification” to accurately identify project issues. It automatically collected data across three layers: decision-making, business, and support, providing a comprehensive digital solution for auditing power-grid projects.

The current study provides an in-depth exploration of implementing the LAud framework in a state-owned power-grid enterprise. By offering detailed insights into the case study background and implementation process, the study highlights the practical application and effectiveness of the LAud framework in enhancing project governance and sustainability through continuous auditing practices and digital innovation.

Backgrounds and cases

State Grid Jiangsu Electric Power Company was selected as the power-grid enterprise in this study, which is a preeminent provincial power grid company within the State Grid Corporation of China. In 2023, they had completed 29 power-grid projects, which were used as the main source of data for developing the LAud framework. Some of the completed power-grid projects included Yangzhou Power Supply Branch Maintenance Facility Project, Zhenjiang Junbei 110 kV Substation Expansion, Nantong Haidong 110 kV Substation Expansion, Qidong Yongyang 220 kV Substation Supporting Grid Project, and so on as illustrated in Fig. 1.

In its pursuit of operational excellence and risk management, they implemented a comprehensive auditing strategy tailored to different types of projects. This strategy ensured rigorous oversight throughout the project lifecycle. Particularly, the tender control price, a critical component of project cost management, was identified as a key focus area for the process tracking management audit, with a separate and detailed audit report issued to provide transparent and actionable insights. These data served as useful information and references in clarifying the process involved in LAud.

Development of LAud framework

As a result, a holistic LAud framework is proposed that covers various critical stages of power-grid projects’ lifecycle after verifying the details with the experts in the company. Figure 2 illustrates the details of the LAud framework. The details of each stage and how they should be implemented in power-grid projects throughout the project lifecycle are as follows:

I.

Stage 1: Project Initiation.

The project initiation stage establishes the foundational framework for power grid development by addressing planning approvals, feasibility study reviews, and compliance with regulatory prerequisites. During this phase, project teams prepare and submit documentation for land use pre-approval, policy alignment, and investment plan formulation. Auditors rigorously evaluate adherence to national policies and corporate governance mandates, ensuring procedural legality, transparency in fund allocation, and alignment with strategic decisions issued by the organization’s leadership. Emphasis is placed on verifying that pre-construction conditions, such as environmental clearances and stakeholder consultations, are fully satisfied before advancing to subsequent stages.

II.

Stage 2: Survey and Design.

The survey and design phase focuses on translating conceptual plans into actionable engineering blueprints. Engineers develop preliminary designs and construction drawings, which undergo iterative reviews to optimize technical specifications, cost efficiency, and safety protocols. Auditors assess the adequacy of geological surveys, structural calculations, and risk mitigation strategies embedded within the designs, ensuring alignment with industry standards and project objectives. This stage also involves oversight of third-party design contractors to prevent deviations from approved parameters. Critical attention is directed toward identifying discrepancies between design iterations and their implications for project timelines, budgets, and operational resilience.

III.

Stage 3: Bidding, Tendering and Procurement.

During the procurement phase, project managers formulate bidding strategies, draft procurement documents, and evaluate vendor qualifications to secure cost-effective and compliant contracts. Auditors monitor the entire procurement lifecycle, from bid solicitation to contract execution, to prevent irregularities such as collusion, inflated pricing, or non-competitive practices. A key audit activity involves comparing winning bid prices with pre-established control benchmarks to detect anomalies. Additionally, auditors scrutinize the fairness of bid evaluation criteria, the accuracy of technical specifications, and the integrity of award decisions. Post-award audits ensure that contractual terms, including delivery schedules and quality guarantees, are explicitly defined and legally binding.

IV.

Stage 4: Implementation of Engineering Project.

The implementation phase prioritizes adherence to safety regulations, contractual obligations, and environmental safeguards. Auditors conduct on-site inspections to verify compliance with land acquisition protocols, migrant worker wage disbursements, and construction quality standards. They validate work volumes through physical measurements, particularly for concealed elements like underground foundations, and assess the legitimacy of design changes or cost adjustments. Contractual deviations, such as unauthorized subcontracting or unapproved scope expansions, are flagged to mitigate financial and operational risks.

Material audits ensure traceability and quality control across the supply chain. Auditors review equipment supervision logs, material distribution records, and storage practices to prevent losses or misuse. They verify tax compliance in material settlements and investigate discrepancies such as inflated procurement costs or off-book inventory. Special attention is given to the disposal of surplus or scrap materials to ensure compliance with waste management regulations.

Financial oversight focuses on budget adherence, tax accountability, and fraud prevention. Auditors reconcile expenditures against feasibility estimates, design budgets, and final settlements to detect overruns. Pre-audit mechanisms are applied to critical payments, including land compensation and contractor invoices, to block unauthorized fund diversion. Rigorous reviews of affiliated entities’ expenses, such as subcontractors or design consultants, further safeguard against fraudulent accounting practices. Ensuring compliance in settlement management and providing a sufficient basis for settlements are also critical. To maintain financial transparency and prevent misuse, pre-audit processes are implemented at various payment stages, including land compensation, construction payments, and material payments. Furthermore, extended audits are conducted on the cost expenditures of affiliated construction, design, and supervisory units. This comprehensive approach helps preventing the establishment of unauthorized funds, commonly referred to as “slush funds,” ensuring that all financial activities are legitimate and properly accounted for.

V.

Stage 5: Engineering Completion.

The completion phase involves a two-tier audit process to finalize project costs and validate deliverables. The settlement audit cross-references completed work with contractual terms through document reviews and on-site inspections, verifying labor costs, material consumption, and scope deviations. The final account audit then reconciles initial budgets with actual expenditures, ensuring adherence to approved scales and timelines. Auditors confirm asset registrations and financial closures, formally certifying the project’s readiness for operational handover.

VI.

Stage 6: Post Completion Audit.

The post-completion audit evaluates the project’s long-term viability and societal impact. Auditors analyze economic returns, environmental sustainability, and grid reliability to identify inefficiencies in planning or execution. Recommendations are formulated to enhance future investment decisions, optimize asset utilization, and align projects with regional development goals. This retrospective assessment ensures accountability, fosters continuous improvement, and strengthens the alignment of power grid investments with national energy strategies.

Testing of LAud framework and proposal of additional workflow

After acceptance of the Laud framework by the power-grid company, a pilot program was initiated to implement full-process auditing using the principles in the LAud framework. This initiative expanded audit supervision to cover the entire project lifecycle, from the initial stages of planning, scheduling, and procurement, through construction, completion, and eventual operation. By adopting an interventionist approach that emphasized mid-process and pre-process engagement, the company carried out ongoing tracking and on-site audits throughout the construction process. As a result, a new workflow was developed to further streamline the audit process. The workflow is illustrated in Fig. 3.

During the project initiation phase, the company’s audit department developed an audit work plan based on the annual audit project schedule. In the audit implementation phase, the audit department formed an audit team as required and issued an audit notice to the audited enterprise, which acknowledged receipt. The audit team then prepared an audit implementation plan, conducting pre-audit surveys when necessary to define the audit scope and focus. On-site audits began with an opening meeting, during which the audited enterprise was expected to provide full cooperation. The audit team conducted the on-site audit, generating audit records and working papers, while the audited enterprise supplied the necessary documents and confirmed the accuracy of the working papers. The audit team also conducted interviews as needed, and the audit department provided project guidance when required.

In the audit report phase, the audit team drafted interim audit reports based on the findings from the on-site audit, and the audited enterprise implemented corrective actions accordingly. After project completion, the audit team prepared the engineering tracking audit report, incorporating insights from both on-site and interim reports and seeking input from relevant departments. Management recommendations were provided based on identified issues, and the audit department reviewed the report before finalizing it. The final audit report was then shared with the audited enterprise for feedback before being officially delivered.

In the post-report phase, the audited unit was responsible for implementing the recommended audit corrections and submitting a detailed feedback report to the audit department. Upon receiving the feedback, the audit department archived all audit project materials in accordance with established requirements, thereby concluding the audit process.

Overall, the new workflow had streamlined the auditing process and strengthened risk mitigation strategies, ensuring that projects were completed successfully and in compliance with established standards and regulations. It also facilitated the timely identification and rectification of issues, significantly enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of project management.

Digital platform of LAud

After successful completion of the pilot program, a full-functional digital platform of LAud was developed to realize all required processes in the practice. It would increase the depth and breadth of off-site data analysis for engineering audit, delving deeper into the value of data. This platform serves as a comprehensive digital audit approach characterized by “full-volume scanning, precise positioning, systematic analysis, and focused verification” to accurately identify issues within engineering projects. It allowed for a comprehensive understanding of the trends in problem risks, providing a basis for targeted tasks in engineering audit. It could automatically collect the necessary data based on three main layers, namely, decision-making layer, business layer and support layer.

The digital platform of LAud is built on a robust technical architecture that ensures seamless integration with existing enterprise systems. It incorporates advanced integration mechanisms to connect with systems such as ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) and BIM (Building Information Modeling), enabling smooth data exchange and collaboration. The platform employs standardized interfaces and data protocols to ensure compatibility and efficient data flow between systems. This integration allows for real-time data sharing, eliminating information silos and enhancing the overall efficiency of project management and auditing processes.

In terms of cybersecurity, the platform implements multiple layers of security measures to protect sensitive project and financial data. These include encryption of data in transit and at rest, strict access controls based on user roles and permissions, and continuous monitoring for potential threats. The platform also undergoes regular security audits and vulnerability assessments to ensure its resilience against evolving cyber threats.

The technical roadmap of the digital platform of LAud is shown in Fig. 4.

Decision-making layer

The decision making level played a pivotal role in offering high - level guidance and devising strategic plans for audit work in the digital platform. The project analysis module conducted an in - depth examination of various aspects of engineering projects. Cost - benefit analysis was performed to evaluate whether the benefits justified the costs. Schedule control was implemented to ensure projects were completed in a timely manner. Risk assessment was carried out to identify potential threats and develop mitigation strategies. The accountability analysis module functioned to ensure clear assignment of responsibility during the audit process. It accurately identified any violations, enhancing transparency and accountability. The issue analysis module was dedicated to pinpointing and analyzing potential problems within engineering projects, allowing for early detection and mitigation of issues. The talent analysis module assessed the capabilities of the audit team. It ensured that audit tasks were executed by individuals with the right skills and knowledge, sometimes even prompting the organization to tailor training programs and professional development initiatives to enhance the skills of the staff.

Business layer

The business layer constituted the central component of the digital audit platform, directly facilitating the execution of audit workflows. For example, the project management module structured the audit lifecycle by encompassing initiation, planning, execution, and monitoring phases. It ensured adherence to predefined objectives and standards through embedded governance frameworks, enabling systematic progress tracking and resource allocation. The rectification management module prioritized issue resolution through a structured feedback loop. Identified discrepancies were logged, tracked, and validated against corrective actions, ensuring accountability and timely remediation. Collectively, these modules synergized to enhance audit efficiency, compliance, and transparency. The business layer’s architecture not only digitized manual processes but also embedded continuous improvement mechanisms, positioning the platform as a scalable solution for evolving audit demands.

Support layer

In the completed platform, the support layer played a crucial in role providing essential backing and resources for the audit work.

The audit knowledge base functioned as a repository. It contained policy regulations, issue classification libraries, and standard working paper templates, serving as a reference and guidance source for auditors. The outcomes repository was utilized to store audit records, issue databases, and international reference materials, supplying historical data and case analyses for future audits. The data resource library, which included a data resource catalog, data quality management, data application scenarios, and data access management, ensured the accuracy and security of audit data.

Within the support and assurance module, the audit knowledge base was divided into a standards library and an outcomes library. The standards library was composed of policy and regulation databases, issue classification libraries, standard working paper templates, template libraries, audit task libraries, standard record templates, audit matter libraries, audit system guidance libraries, rectification standard libraries, regulatory penalty libraries, and rectification standard libraries. The outcomes library consisted of audit case libraries, project material libraries, working paper libraries, audit record libraries, issue libraries, entity material libraries, audit label libraries, audit training libraries, and international reference libraries. It is worth noting that the audit training library had been planned to be launched in the third phase of the platform.

In summary, the digital audit platform had been designed with a multi - role workstation approach, empowered stakeholders to access particular functions and information in line with their needs. This not only enhanced the efficiency and quality of the audit work but also, through in - depth data analysis and mining, lent strong support and assurance to engineering project management. Figure 5 illustrates the main interface of the digital platform of LAud.

Challenges and achievements of the LAud framework

The case study on implementing the LAud framework at State Grid Jiangsu Electric Power Company faced several challenges. The power-grid projects’ complexity, varying in scale and technical requirements, demanded auditors to possess extensive technical and managerial knowledge. For instance, substation expansion required coordinating multiple technical systems, while smart grid implementation needed advanced technology integration. Additionally, data integration from diverse sources like project management software and financial systems was hindered by inconsistency and incompatibility, necessitating unified data standards. Resistance to change from staff accustomed to traditional auditing also posed a challenge, requiring extensive communication and training. Ensuring the digital platform’s security and stability was another critical concern, demanding significant investment in cybersecurity measures.

However, the LAud framework also brings remarkable achievements. In 2023, State Grid Jiangsu Electric Power Company audited 111,400 engineering projects, covering a total investment of 78.047 billion yuan, and achieved cost savings and revenue increments of 2.902 billion yuan through measures such as reducing engineering costs. The full-process auditing work not only enhanced the efficiency and quality of audits but also significantly improved the management level of engineering projects and the efficiency of fund utilization. Furthermore, the LAud framework played a crucial role in these achievements by providing comprehensive oversight throughout the project lifecycle, enabling early issue identification and risk reduction. The digital platform significantly improved audit efficiency through automated data analysis and report generation, allowing for more accurate and timely project issue identification. The framework strengthened risk control by enabling proactive risk monitoring and mitigation strategies across all project stages, minimizing potential losses. It also supported the company’s sustainability goals by ensuring environmental compliance and efficient resource utilization. The post-completion audit offered insights into projects’ long-term viability and societal impact, guiding future investment decisions. Furthermore, the digital platform marked a significant step in the company’s digital transformation, demonstrating how technology can enhance traditional auditing practices. Finally, the framework fostered better collaboration among stakeholders, improving communication and coordination among various roles within the company.

Theoretical contributions

This research has made significant strides in exploring the application of LAud in power-grid projects. Through a qualitative case study approach, we examined the implementation of a full-process LAud model within a state-owned organization’s internal audit framework. The study analyzed data from 29 completed power-grid projects and incorporated expert interviews to validate the framework and investigate collaborative governance mechanisms and digital empowerment strategies. The core outcome is the development of a comprehensive LAud framework that covers all critical stages of power-grid projects’ lifecycle, from initiation to post-completion audit. This framework has been tested and refined through a pilot program, leading to the creation of a new workflow and a fully functional digital platform for LAud. The results demonstrate that LAud can enhance project governance and sustainability by enabling real-time monitoring, proactive risk mitigation, and continuous data integration, thereby addressing the limitations of traditional auditing methods.

The study advances theoretical discourse by redefining lifecycle auditing as a dynamic, technology-driven governance mechanism rather than a static compliance tool. Traditional auditing frameworks, as critiqued, often prioritize periodic financial reviews, neglecting operational risks embedded in early project phases23. By contrast, this research operationalizes LAud as a holistic system that embeds real-time assurance across design, procurement, construction, and operational stages—a paradigm shift aligning the call for resilience-oriented auditing in critical infrastructure32. The integration of SCADA systems and IoT sensors for compliance tracking extends foundational work on continuous auditing25, bridging the gap between financial reporting and engineering integrity. Furthermore, the framework’s emphasis on predictive analytics for risk forecasting (e.g., design-phase anomalies) responds to advocacy for AI-enhanced evaluation methods in power projects14. This contribution repositions LAud as a cornerstone of sustainable infrastructure governance, harmonizing technical specifications with fiscal accountability.

The second theoretical contribution lies in elucidating the role of collaborative digital ecosystems in overcoming siloed audit practices. Prior studies, such as those by Zhou et al.35, identified fragmented oversight as a key barrier to infrastructure risk management. This research demonstrates how LAud’s digital platform fosters interdisciplinary collaboration among engineers, auditors, and policymakers through shared data interfaces and automated reporting. By aligning real-time audit findings with strategic decision-making, the framework operationalizes the “collaborative assurance” concept proposed by Wahdan et al.31, which emphasizes cross-functional transparency. These findings extend holistic audit model36 by embedding stakeholder synergy into lifecycle governance, thereby addressing the feedback loop deficiencies.

The third theoretical contribution is the exploration of the digital empowerment mechanisms within the LAud framework. This research highlights the critical role of technology in enhancing audit efficiency and effectiveness. The developed digital platform for LAud incorporates advanced technologies such as IoT sensors, SCADA systems, and machine learning algorithms. These technologies enable high-frequency audit cycles aligned with project milestones, automated monitoring of technical, financial, and operational parameters, and exception-based auditing supplemented by human expertise for complex judgments25. The platform also supports continuous data modeling using inputs from various sources, providing real-time assurance over both financial and non-financial performance indicators. This technological integration addresses the limitations of traditional auditing methods, which often struggle with the dynamic and complex nature of power-grid projects23,43. The digital empowerment mechanisms developed in this study provide a theoretical foundation for how technology can transform audit practices in critical infrastructure sectors.

Practical implementations

The implementation of the LAud framework can lead to improved project governance and sustainability by enabling proactive risk identification and immediate corrective actions throughout the project lifecycle. For project managers and auditors, the framework provides a structured approach to tracking progress against planned schedules, budgets, and quality benchmarks, facilitating better decision-making. The digital platform developed in this study offers a scalable solution for continuous auditing and enhances the accuracy and timeliness of audit reports. This can result in significant cost savings and improved project outcomes. Additionally, the collaborative governance mechanisms within the LAud framework promote transparency and accountability among stakeholders, fostering a culture of continuous improvement and alignment with organizational goals.

The LAud framework has enormous potential for widespread application. It can be adapted for use in other types of organizations and industries, though some modifications may be necessary. State-owned enterprises typically prioritize regulatory compliance, public accountability, and long-term societal impacts, aligning with centralized governance structures. In contrast, private enterprises often emphasize cost efficiency, shareholder returns, and agile decision-making, necessitating streamlined audit workflows and faster return-on-investment justification. For example, private enterprises may need to adjust the framework to suit their unique governance models and operational dynamics. Future development of LAud should consider the different needs in private enterprises, while retaining its core principles of real-time monitoring and proactive risk management during its implementation.

The implementation of the LAud framework may encounter several obstacles, such as high costs, training demands, and organizational resistance to innovation. Organizations might be reluctant to invest in new technologies and training programs due to budget constraints. Additionally, integrating the LAud digital platform with existing systems like ERP and BIM can be complex. To address these issues, organizations should conduct thorough cost-benefit analyses to demonstrate the long-term advantages of adopting LAud. Developing comprehensive training programs and effective change management strategies can help overcome resistance and ensure a smooth implementation process.

When compared to other contemporary audit models, the LAud framework offers several advantages. Traditional audit models typically focus on periodic financial reviews, often overlooking operational risks across project phases. In contrast, this framework provides continuous, real-time monitoring across all project stages, from design to operation. This holistic approach enables early risk detection and timely corrective actions. While other models may offer valuable insights, LAud uniquely combines technical, financial, and operational data using advanced technologies like IoT sensors and machine learning algorithms, providing a more comprehensive view of project performance. The framework’s emphasis on proactive risk mitigation and continuous improvement further distinguishes it from models that primarily rely on post-hoc analysis. These features make the LAud framework a superior choice for auditing complex infrastructure projects.",https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-025-20389-9/MediaObjects/41598_2025_20389_Fig1_HTML.png,N,,2025-10-17 17:07:47.615205

We just wrapped up the IUCN World Conservation Congress in Abu Dhabi, after a packed, inspirational and exhausting seven days, working with passionate and knowledgeable advocates for nature from across the globe, within and beyond the BirdLife Partnership.

Dr Lesley Dickie, Executive Vice President for Conservation and the Regions at BirdLife International, said:

“Bringing thousands of conservationists together, the IUCN World Conservation Congress has stimulated vital debate about how we shape our world. It is an ever more important imperative that open dialogue takes place when the stakes are so high. The IUCN Congress gives space for the conversations we must have to save our precious nature. Now, we get back to action.”

The Congress in numbers:

Over 10,000 participants with representation from more than 45 BirdLife Partners (totalling over 80 BirdLife Partnership delegates)

147 resolutions adopted (and 17 motions co-sponsored by BirdLife Partnership)

1,360 bird species reassessed as part of the IUCN Red List Update

100+ new IUCN Members welcomed, including six new State Members

100+ Indigenous Leaders gathered for landmark World Summit

New IUCN leadership (2026-2029) elected with various BirdLife Partners and supporters on board

A unique forum happening only every four years, the Congress is a big deal for the future of our planet. The world’s largest and most influential gathering on nature, it brought together around 10,000 participants from governments, civil society, Indigenous Peoples’ organisations, donors, academia and business. Together we raised the alarm on pressing threats to nature, highlighted solutions and innovations, and set the agenda for policy and action on the ground, endorsing a new 20-year vision for the Union.

The BirdLife Partnership – the world’s oldest and largest global partnership for nature, with 123 national NGO Partners around the world – was there in force, with more than 80 staff from over 45 IUCN Member/BirdLife Partners joining forces for nature. This is always the biggest BirdLife delegation we see in any global meeting, which allows us to catch up with each other as a Partnership and to learn from what is working in different parts of the world.

Taking stock halfway to 2030

This Congress came at a key juncture, midway to 2030. It was a moment to take stock of progress toward the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework, the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration, the Paris Agreement on Climate, and the Sustainable Development Goals. The ongoing geopolitics and financial climate continue to challenge the current operating environment. However, an emergency motion reaffirming the importance of IUCN’s role in multilateralism and international cooperation highlighted the need for us to work together. It called on us to underscore the importance of nature as the foundation of economies and societies, and to make clear the links to climate ahead of the COP30 climate talks in Brazil next month.

The power of many: scale and collaboration

We at BirdLife went into the Congress having launched an incredibly exciting new partnership with the World Bank, working with a strategic network of more than 50 of our Partners to scale up implementation and innovative finance for nature across the Africa-Eurasia flyway. It’s exactly this idea of scale and collaboration, which is at the heart of IUCN, BirdLife and our wider partnerships, that are needed to deliver action and finance at the necessary scale and pace to reverse the loss of biodiversity by 2030.

The BirdLife Partnership was involved in events across the Forum, which took place on the first days of the Congress, and co-sponsored 17 motions. These were discussed in groups and then voted on in the Members’ Assembly over the final three days.

Highlighting issues and showcasing solutions

Many motions and events highlighted key issues and solutions relating to species, sites, systems and society and covering science, partnership, advocacy, and implementation. With the latest update of the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species revealing increasing declines in birds and other taxa, we highlighted how citizen science, such as birding, can help us understand the status and trends of birds and biodiversity to inform policy and action.

Like BirdLife, IUCN continues to champion species and the importance of species data, which underpins some of the critical knowledge products (including the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species and Key Biodiversity Areas) and tools (such as IBAT – the Integrated Biodiversity Assessment Tool, AVISTEP – the Avian Sensitivity for Energy Planning, and TESSA – the Toolkit for Ecosystem Service Site-Based Assessment), that help guide conservation and development to ensure optimal and efficient outcomes for nature, climate and people.

Throughout the Congress, we highlighted some of the big initiatives that apply this knowledge and experience together with on-ground expertise through our Partners. We shared insights about our regional flyways initiatives and the Conserva Aves initiative focused on identifying, designating and effectively managing locally-led protected and conserved areas across 11 countries in the Americas. We also talked about our Forest Impact Accelerator initiative, which has just received funding from the UK government to establish sustainable finance initiatives in priority tropical forest landscapes to help secure 1 million hectares of Key Biodiversity Areas alongside economic benefits for 200,000 local people.

We held a side-meeting of the Convention on Migratory Species Energy Task Force, which we coordinate, where we discussed and showcased ways to achieve a just renewable energy transition that contributes to both net zero and nature positive global goals. And we discussed how our new Nature Action Tracker can hold governments to account, understand what works and incentivise efforts, and shared our new guidance on just and effective engagement in landscape restoration.

The business-end of the Congress

One of the most important outcomes of the Congress is the discussion and agreement of motions, which, if passed, become resolutions or recommendations and guide the work and advocacy of the Union over the coming quadrennium. IUCN members passed 147 motions in total, 97 through an electronic vote last month, and the remainder following discussions in small ‘contact groups’ and when necessary, in plenary before being taken to the vote. While emotions ran high on some, with varying opinions reflecting the diversity of IUCN, the tone remained civil and constructive, enabling compromise to be reached in nearly every case.

Successful motions covered a wide range of issues. We proposed one which passed through the e-vote on ensuring companies disclose and take action to minimise negative impacts on biodiversity in ways that will achieve the goals of the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (KMGBF). This highlights the importance of global biodiversity data, such as the IUCN Red List and Key Biodiversity Areas, in helping to guide both development and conservation. It also links to other motions on the need for businesses, sectors such as renewable energy and mechanisms such as biodiversity credits to contribute to the nature positive global goal, which is aligned with the KMGBF mission of halting and reversing the loss of biodiversity by 2030.

Christine Dragisic, Managing Director of Global Policy at Audubon Society (one of our BirdLife Partners in the US) added: “The IUCN World Conservation Congress 2025 was a powerful reminder of what’s possible when we work together for nature. It was inspiring for Audubon to stand alongside our BirdLife partners to showcase innovative conservation and advance resolutions that will benefit birds, people, and the planet across the Americas and beyond.”

Several motions debated and voted on at the Congress focused on area-based conservation. They called for stronger protections against unsustainable tourism, such as the proposal from PPNEA, our Partner in Albania. Other motions addressed the protection of seamounts, the integrity of mesopelagic ecosystems in the oceans, and forest integrity in the Congo Basin. Together, these efforts highlighted the need to deliver both the qualitative and quantitative aspects of the ‘30×30’ target of the KMGBF — to effectively and equitably protect and conserve at least 30% of terrestrial, inland water, coastal, and marine areas by 2030. This includes key areas for biodiversity and ecosystem services, while also beginning to look ahead to more ambitious targets beyond 2030.

There were also several motions relating to the rights of nature, as well as one calling for recognition of the crime of ecocide – interesting developments which would provide additional legal channels to protect nature.

Finally, key motions supporting the non-proliferation of fossil fuels (and an urgent, just, nature-positive renewable energy transition), the need to address plastic pollution following the collapse of negotiations to agree a plastics treaty, and the endorsement of an IUCN policy on synthetic biology provide a strong legacy of this Congress.

Joseph Onoja, Director General of the Nigerian Conservation Foundation, said:

“From over 40 countries, one flock, one purpose. At the IUCN World Conservation Congress, BirdLife Partners stood united — speaking for nature, people, and the planet we all share.

It was, as always, a great pleasure to join the BirdLife flock at the IUCN World Conservation Congress. We demonstrated remarkable camaraderie, working with clear purpose and unity. Together, we supported motions that not only strengthen the work of IUCN but also advance our shared mission to conserve nature and improve the wellbeing of people.”

Dive Brief:

A coalition of 22 states and the District of Columbia on Wednesday sued the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin for ending the $7 billion Solar for All Program.

Separately, a coalition of 24 Solar for All grant recipients on Tuesday filed a breach-of-contract complaint in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims to recover damages for the EPA’s termination of Solar for All grants.

The states’ legal actions follow similar lawsuits filed Monday by Harris County, Texas, and last week by solar companies and community and labor groups arguing that the EPA’s termination of the Solar for All program strips local governments of critical clean energy funding

Dive Insight:

The lawsuit, filed by 22 states in U.S. District Court in the Western District of Washington, alleges the EPA has “unilaterally and illegally terminated a multi-billion-dollar program designed to bring low-cost distributed solar energy to over 900,000 households in low-income and disadvantaged communities.”

The EPA abruptly ended the Solar for All program, created under the Clean Air Act’s Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund to help low-income communities adopt clean energy, as part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act in July, the plaintiffs said in the court filing.

Because all $7 billion in Solar for All grants had already been obligated by August 2024 — before the OBBBA became law — the plaintiffs contend the EPA acted illegally by terminating the program and blocking access to their awarded funds, the states contend.

“Plaintiffs relied upon the SFA Program to meet benchmarks for clean energy production, to create jobs, to limit environmental damage caused by pollutants, and to generate energy cost savings for households, including in low-income and disadvantaged communities,” the lawsuit states.

The attorneys general of Arizona, Minnesota and Washington are leading the complaint, which was joined by the attorneys general of California, Colorado, Connecticut, the District of Columbia, Hawaiʻi, Illinois, Massachusetts, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island and Vermont. The governors of Kentucky and Pennsylvania, as well as the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation, also joined the complaint.

Connecticut Attorney General William Tong said in a statement that the EPA awarded the funds, which were created by Congress, so Connecticut could help low-income residents save millions of dollars on their energy bills. “Trump cannot unilaterally reverse course now, and we’re suing to make sure Connecticut gets every penny we are owed,” he said.

Connecticut was awarded $62.5 million last year in Solar for All funding to increase access to solar and energy storage for low-income communities, including multifamily affordable housing.

″As public servants, it is incumbent upon us to fight for fairness and justice, and that is what this lawsuit sets out to do,” California Energy Commission Chair David Hochschild said in a statement. “The state’s goal to advance a 100% clean energy future depends on programs like this that make solar and storage affordable for all.”

The EPA is terminating nearly $250 million in funds awarded to California, including $200 million to build community solar systems, primarily for lower- and middle-income families, and $9 million for workforce training.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/Sd5zkBpjElCjYc0OBkXEjiIm7ZfqDj1RA2oLgDR_LFs/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0yMTUwMTg0NzUzLmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-10-17 13:11:43.216295

The failed sales mark a setback in President Donald Trump's push to revive a coal mining industry that's been in decline for almost two decades.

The Interior Department rejected the sole bid it received for two tracts of federal coal reserves on the Manti-La Sal National Forest near central Utah's Skyline Mine because it did not meet the requirements of the Mineral Leasing Act, agency spokesperson Alyse Sharpe said.

The leasing act requires companies to pay fair market value for coal mined on public lands. Sharpe declined to say how much was bid.

The coal tracts were requested by a subsidiary of Utah mining company Wolverine Fuels LLC, which operates the Skyline Mine and other coal mines in central Utah.

Could mining boom days return to small Utah towns?

Officials had offered a lease on one tract, with 1.3 million tons of coal, during an Oct. 1 competitive sale. The other tract, with 5 million tons of coal, was a modification to an existing lease. The rejected bid covered both tracts, Sharpe said.

Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said two weeks ago that the government will open 13 million acres of federal lands for coal mining. But it's unclear who would want that fuel as utilities turn to cheaper natural gas and renewables such as wind and solar to generate electricity.

Emissions from burning coal are a leading driver of climate change that's raising sea levels and making weather more extreme.

On Oct. 6, a coal sale from public lands in Montana that would have been the largest by the government in more than a decade drew a single bid of $186,000, or about one-tenth of a penny per ton of coal, and was later rejected. That lease held 167 million tons of coal in southeastern Montana near the Navajo Transition Energy Co.'s Spring Creek mine.

Two days later the Interior Department postponed an even bigger sale — 440 million tons next to the Navajo Nation-owned company's Antelope Mine in Wyoming.

Sharpe repeated the Republican Trump administration's assertion that the policies of former Presidents Joe Biden and Barack Obama were to blame for the failed sales, saying the Democrats tried ""to dismantle domestic production and shake investor confidence in the industry.""

Both Democrats attempted to curb sales of coal from public lands, only to have those policies reversed by Trump.

Three other coal lease sales from public lands under Trump were successful. The largest, in Alabama, involved 54 million tons of coal used in steelmaking that sold last month for $46 million, or about 87 cents per ton. Two recent sales in North Dakota of leases containing a combined 30 million tons of coal brought in $186,000 total, or less than a penny per ton.

""As demand for reliable, dispatchable power grows, coal remains a critical component of ensuring affordable and dependable energy for the American people,"" Sharpe said in a statement.

But industry analysts and economists say the biggest driver of coal's retreat has been market forces that make other fuels more economical. Many power plants served by large mines on public lands in the West are nearing retirement.

Environmentalists have fought for years against the expansion of Utah's Skyline Mine. Emma Yip with the Center for Biological Diversity described the bid rejection as ""yet another face-plant for the Trump administration"" as it tries to prop up a dying industry.

To the Editor:

During my 35-year career in environmental advocacy, I’ve opposed the privatization of natural resources numerous times. Clean air, land, and water are essential natural resources that must be managed in trust for everyone, and I have always believed strongly in public management.

When it comes to the ballot question regarding whether or not Hopewell Borough should sell its water system to New Jersey American Water, however, I will be voting yes.

I’m grateful to live in a town where residents—and our elected officials—take such decisions seriously. The large crowd that turned out to hear a presentation from opponents of the sale is evidence that participatory democracy is alive and well in Hopewell. I appreciate the diligence, commitment, and sincerity of the opponents.

I am also sympathetic to some of the arguments against the sale. The idea of local control of resources resonates with me.

But there is nothing more essential to the health of our families than the delivery of clean, safe, and healthy water. Let’s be honest with ourselves. Our beloved town is simply not up to this job. We can appreciate the staff who manage our water system. But the system is suffering from decades of deferred maintenance, and we’ve been hit with several violations from the NJ Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP).

In May, Hopewell residents received a mailing informing us that for 274 days in 2024, managers of our system failed to adequately treat our water with an additive that is used to prevent lead and other metals from leaching into our drinking water.

Change is scary. But so is lead and the forever chemical PFAS that persist in our water system.

New Jersey American Water (NJAW) is already delivering water to Hopewell to supplement our municipal well and that water meets the state of New Jersey’s standards for PFAS compounds. Moreover, the company is committed to meeting the US Environmental Protection Agency’s more stringent standards set under the Biden Administration, despite action by the Trump Administration to postpone the deadline for water systems to meet this stricter standard. According to NJAW “The recently announced plan by the EPA to extend the timeline for compliance would not impact New Jersey American Water’s PFAS compliance or capital plan as the company is committed to complying with the standards in a timely manner.”

Regarding removal of lead from Hopewell’s water system, assuming that the town votes in favor of the referendum, NJAW “intends to complete all replacements within 18-24 months (dependent on resident cooperation), ahead of the NJDEP 2031 deadline.”

Some have suggested that if Hopewell’s water infrastructure is sold to NJAW we would be left to the mercy of the company without any protection for the public interest. This is false.

New Jersey is fortunate to have several public agencies, in addition to NJDEP, that work to protect public health and the public interest.

The New Jersey Water Supply Authority (NJWSA) is charged with preserving both the quantity and quality of the source water that is refined and delivered to the state’s residents by private and public water companies. NJWSA manages the Spruce Run and Round Valley reservoirs on the Raritan River as well as the D&R Canal, another important source of drinking water.

NJWSA works in partnership with NJAW and other private and public water providers, NJDEP, nonprofit organizations like The Watershed Institute, academic institutions, and others to protect watersheds and surface waters through planning and preservation programs.

A second public body, the NJ Board of Public Utilities (BPU), is charged with regulating utilities like NJAW to provide safe, reliable, and reasonably priced services to the public.

In addition, the New Jersey Ratepayer Advocate serves as a watchdog to protect consumers from unfair pricing practices. These agencies and programs are certainly not perfect, but they exist to protect the public interest.

Hopewell residents need to decide for themselves how to vote on the Hopewell water referendum. I’ve decided to vote yes, and I hope that you will join me. The status quo is not acceptable.

Sincerely,

Jim Waltman

The investments aim to span multiple projects under U.S. oversight, foster transatlantic cooperation that enhances energy security, and focus on creating a robust and resilient fuel ecosystem. Specific projects and investment amounts will be detailed in forthcoming definitive agreements.

The partnership strengthens all parties' abilities to supply the growing global demand for energy. This effort includes co-investment into, and co-location of, fuel fabrication facilities and could include repurposing surplus plutonium in a manner consistent with established U.S. safety and security requirements.

“Fissioning surplus plutonium is the best way to eliminate a legacy liability while creating an abundant near-term fuel source. It can accelerate the deployment of multiple gigawatts of advanced reactors and serve as a bridge fuel until uranium enrichment and recycling scale up,” said Jacob DeWitte, co-founder and CEO of Oklo.

“This strategic partnership proves that energy independence relies on advanced fuels and promotes an integrated closed-loop fuel cycle. newcleo and its partners are ready to add value to the transatlantic cooperation in providing clean, safe and secure energy. The agreement proves that the U.S. and Europe can lead in this sector,” said Stefano Buono, founder and CEO of newcleo.

By channeling large-scale transatlantic investments into the American advanced nuclear industry, the partnership exemplifies newcleo’s and Blykalla’s interest in the U.S. market and supports the domestic expansion of Oklo’s fuel and fast-reactor technologies. Partnerships like this show how allied collaboration can strengthen energy innovation, leadership, and dominance in the United States.

“This agreement to implement newcleo's advanced fuel expertise into Oklo's powerhouses and invest $2 billion into American infrastructure and advanced fuel solutions is yet another win for President Donald J. Trump's American Energy Dominance Agenda,” said Secretary of the Interior and Chairman of the National Energy Dominance Council Doug Burgum. “This administration is committed to enhancing energy security, creating more American jobs, and ensuring that the United States remains at the forefront of global energy production and innovation, and I'm honored to support today's announcement to advance these goals.”

The partnership aligns private capital with federal priorities to accelerate advanced nuclear deployment while bolstering U.S. energy security and transatlantic cooperation and strengthening the domestic fuel supply.

The image, reposted from X, shows an EV charging station missing its cords, with one commenter quipping, ""I didn't realize that EV wireless charging was a thing now.""

The original Reddit poster asked a question many have been wondering: ""What's the solution? Anti-cutting cable wrap? Cameras to passively capture after the theft?""

Below the post, drivers debated whether this kind of damage counts as vandalism or theft — and what can realistically be done about it.

""Is it vandalism, or theft?"" one user asked, suggesting that some thieves might be targeting cables for copper. ""There are ones on light poles, way above the ground that spool.""

Others countered that even switching to aluminum wiring isn't a fix. ""That... won't solve the problem,"" one commenter said. ""Thieves don't steal copper — they steal things that they think are copper. Even if they abandon it because it's aluminum, it's still cut.""

These incidents aren't isolated. While this post is from three years ago, similar reports continue to surface from Los Angeles to Atlanta, with stations temporarily disabled for weeks while parts are replaced. Beyond inconvenience, the trend highlights a larger barrier to electric vehicle adoption: reliability. When chargers are damaged or out of service, drivers lose trust in the public charging network, which is a critical piece of infrastructure needed to transition away from dirty energy.

Electric vehicles remain one of the cleanest transportation options available, even factoring in battery manufacturing and charging emissions. Mining for battery minerals carries an environmental cost, but it replaces the far greater toll of extracting billions of tons of coal, oil, and gas each year.

For those charging at home, pairing an EV with solar panels can cut both costs and emissions even further. Drivers who install solar panels can effectively power their cars with sunlight, and companies like EnergySage make it easy to compare local quotes and find reliable installers vetted by The Cool Down.

While no single fix exists yet, experts say that protecting public chargers and the trust they represent is vital to keeping EV progress on track toward a cleaner, more sustainable future.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/cut-charging-cablesimage-recqjJTSPDfBkHNYP-1.jpg,N,,2025-10-17 20:07:30.008715

In North Carolina, state regulators are trying to figure out how to meet this unprecedented demand while also protecting the average ratepayer. Earlier this week, the North Carolina Utilities Commission held a two-day 'large load technical conference' to talk about these issues.

This conversation has been edited lightly for clarity.

Let’s start by introducing the players here. Who or what is the North Carolina Utilities Commission? Who was at the meeting this week?

The utilities commission is a five-person regulatory agency. They regulate public utilities in North Carolina, the largest being Duke Energy, which provides energy to the vast majority of the state.

The meeting held this week was focused on how to best serve large load customers like data centers. Several different stakeholders presented their ideas to the commission, including Duke Energy, Dominion Energy, clean energy advocates, and representatives from the data center industry.

In this context, what is the term 'large load'?

A large load customer is a customer that requires a lot of energy. According to a congressional report, data centers across the U.S. in 2023 used about 176 terawatt hours of energy, or about 4.4% of the country’s total electricity consumption that year. Some projections show the energy consumption from data centers could double or triple by 2028.

And why is that? Data centers have been around for years already. Why are they going to need so much more energy now?

Because of the rise of AI. At the meeting this week, I heard over and over again that right now, we're at an inflection point. How we choose to respond to this situation is going to have ramifications on energy production, infrastructure, and on the climate for decades to come.

What else did you hear at this week’s meeting? What are some of your biggest takeaways?

It seems that right now in North Carolina, there are a lot more questions than answers. Some of the biggest questions are: How much more energy are we going to need? By when do we need it? How are we going to generate that energy, and who’s going to pay for it?

Something else that stood out to me is that there are a lot of different balancing acts going on. Political leaders and Duke Energy representatives say data centers want to come to North Carolina because we have such a business friendly climate. These are million, and in some cases, billion dollar investments that provide good paying jobs for local families.

But that economic opportunity has to be balanced with consumer protections. The utilities commission wants to make sure the average person isn’t paying for additional energy infrastructure that’s ultimately meant to support data centers.

This is often what we hear when utilities have to generate more electricity. They talk about raising rates on ratepayers. Did this meeting provide any clarification on whether ratepayers will be paying more?

I think it’s fair to assume that yes, ratepayers can expect to keep seeing higher prices. Duke Energy representatives emphasized that they have to make upgrades to existing resources to increase reliability, while at the same time adding new resources to generate more energy.

Company representatives also really stressed that over the long term, as more large load customers join the system, that should alleviate rates. But it’s my understanding that that downward pressure won’t happen until at least another 15 years.

Another important topic that was discussed is energy generation. How are we going to produce all this energy? Data centers want energy as quickly as possible, and fossil fuels like natural gas and coal can meet this large demand quickly. But we have to remember that there’s a backdrop here of reaching net zero carbon emissions in North Carolina by 2050. Under state law, Duke Energy has to be carbon free by then.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a8ea988/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2048x1075+0+230/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F35%2F5c%2Ff7d0261440238241cca7e61e5356%2Fimg-6981.JPEG,N,,2025-10-17 12:13:37.691490

A Cameron Parish judge has ruled that state officials violated the Louisiana Constitution when they issued a permit for a liquified gas export terminal, which has halted construction on the facility.

The decision, reached Friday, found that the Louisiana Department of Conservation and Energy (formerly Energy and Natural Resources) failed to consider the environmental impacts on surrounding communities when it approved a permit for the Commonwealth LNG export facility.

The halted Commonwealth facility is one of six LNG export projects proposed, approved or operating along Cameron’s coast. Construction of the pipelines, storage tanks and shipping facilities that make up the facility would dig up or fill nearly 200 acres of wetlands and water bottoms, according to the project’s coastal use permit application.

Judge Penelope Richard cited the close vicinity of other export terminals as a factor in her decision, saying the state “failed to consider the secondary and cumulative impacts” of these facilities on climate change in the coastal zone.

“We hope this ruling shakes Louisiana to its senses,” said Anne Rolfes, director of Louisiana Bucket Brigade. “The coastal use permit needs to be revoked.”

Rolfes’s organization, the Sierra Club and the Turtle Island Restoration Network filed the suit in August 2024.

“This is an area of the Louisiana coastline that is being devastated by LNG facilities,” said Joanie Steinhaus, ocean program director for Turtle Island Restoration Network. “These agencies have long ignored the cumulative impact to air and water quality and the health of the local community members and the environment”

There was no immediate response to attempts Tuesday to reach Commonwealth LNG about the court ruling.

Another lawsuit in a U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit rejected the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s approval of the project, citing its pollution impact. The decision delayed construction for two months until a new permit reevaluated the full impact of air pollution harms.

The state permit for Commonwealth LNG will be suspended until the Office of Coastal Management considers climate change and environmental justice concerns in its evaluation, according to Judge Richard’s ruling.

The plan outlines strategies for improving environmental, social, political and economic conditions to safeguard communities along a waterfront.

In Ontario, coastal climate impacts are evident through increased water levels, erosion and flooding, threatening homes, businesses and essential infrastructure.

Recent climate events have caused billions of dollars in flooding damage to Lake Ontario communities, including torrential rains in 2024 and record-high 100-year water levels in 2019.

“When we talk about most coastal communities down here in Niagara, we’re talking about built environments, natural environments, diversity of agriculture and economy, and also the social connection to the lake itself and the environment,” said Leilani Lee-Yates, the chief administrative officer of the Niagara Peninsula Conservation Authority.

The authority is partnering with Conservation Halton and the Hamilton Conservation Authority on the project. They operate under Conservation Ontario, which represents the province’s 36 conservation authorities.

Conservation authorities are local, nonprofit organizations with jurisdiction over a particular watershed.

They help communities create coastal resilience plans through science-based research to support growth and shoreline protection into the future, Lee-Yates said.

They are also exploring other types of shoreline protection measures.

Nature-based solutions use natural resources to prevent further shoreline erosion, unlike gray infrastructure, which relies on materials like metal or concrete.

The Lake Ontario Coastal Resilience Pilot Project will determine the most optimal course of action, which may use a combination of both techniques.

The authority will also collaborate with the Global Centre for Climate Change and Transboundary Waters and the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence Cities Initiative. These organizations approach coastal resiliency from complementary angles.

“Our side is we’re looking at what are the socio-demographic, economic, governance and policy challenges that these climate imperatives are going to present for governance and community and political action in these areas,” said co-principal investigator Carolyn Johns of the Global Centre for Climate Change and Transboundary Waters .

The Lake Ontario Coastal Resilience Pilot Project is one of three pilot projects under Natural Resource Canada’s Climate-Resilient Coastal Communities Program. The multi-jurisdictional collaboration on this project spans northern Lake Superior, southern Lake Huron and western Lake Ontario.

“We’re really interested in populations that may not historically or traditionally be engaged in conservation authority work in watershed work, environmental work and specifically coastal resilience work,” Johns said.

Groups to be included are farmers, developers, anglers, Indigenous communities and youth.

Combined, the three projects have secured $4.9 million in funding. The Southern Lake Huron Littoral Cell Adaptation Plan is the furthest along, with two of its five years completed.

“Part of our project is teasing out what are all the current policies and laws that affect coastal resilience,” Johns said.

Johns and her team are identifying which policies could help local communities become more resilient. They are also examining which policies require innovation and adaptation.

“For instance, they might be designed to regulate flood zones, and those flood zones may have been based on some historical information and not really based on the current climate context,” Johns said.

The Niagara Peninsula Conservation Authority has connected with other diverse partners on the project to achieve these goals. One is the Mississaugas of the Credit First Nation, which “is so happy to join our partners in stewardship to restore, preserve and protect our coastal areas within our treaty territory,” Chief Claire Sault said in an email.

“I’m grateful that we have many valued allies who value this important work and initiative,” Sault said.

The name “Mississaugas” comes from the Anishinaabemowin word, “Missisakis,” which means “many river mouths.” The Mississaugas trace their name to the Trent, Moira, Shannon, Napanee, Kingston and Gananoque rivers.

Part of their vision is to safeguard the environment for future generations, a goal shared by the Lake Ontario Coastal Resilience Pilot Project.

By evaluating the current factors that contribute to coastal resilience in lakes Ontario, Huron and Superior, the Climate-Resilient Coastal Communities Program seeks to share best practices across all Ontario coastal communities.

“It’s very important because the Great Lakes are facing climate change and the communities that are going to grapple with that and need to adapt the most are the coastal communities,” Johns said. “The scale of this is really important because it’s really where the impacts are felt.”",https://greatlakesecho.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/COASTAL-RESILIENCE-AUTHORITIES-1170x780.jpg,N,,2025-10-17 13:12:30.015110

About Bruce Power","The Provincial Building and Construction Trades Council of Ontario is bullish on the opportunities ahead for skilled tradespeople with Bruce Power’s ongoing Life-Extension Program, Major Component Replacement (MCR), and Bruce C Projects.

Continuing long-standing support for Bruce Power and its operations and projects, delegates to the Building Trades’ 68th Annual Convention in Windsor passed a resolution re-affirming their commitment to collaborating to further the company’s Life-Extension Program and MCR project, as well as new opportunities with the Bruce C Project, which could see the development of a new nuclear build on the Bruce Power site.

“The Ontario government’s Integrated Energy Plan – Energy for Generations – recognizes Bruce Power’s critical role in securing the future of the province’s clean energy supply, as well as the possibility of new nuclear through its Bruce C project,” said Marc Arsenault, Business Manager and Secretary-Treasurer of the Provincial Building and Construction Trades Council of Ontario. “Thanks to the hard work and dedication of Building Trades workers at Bruce Power, refurbishments are advancing safely, with quality, and on schedule, and the Bruce C project would create and sustain thousands of direct and indirect jobs during construction and operation.”

During the design and construction phase of Bruce C, it is estimated that more than 20,000 jobs would be created or supported nationally each year. Across the entire project lifespan, an estimated 12,000 full-time equivalent jobs would be created or supported annually in Canada.

The Building Trades Council resolution also called on the government to bolster its plans through policy certainty by “unlocking investment through Investment Tax Credits (ITCs) and other innovative financing models, Indigenous participation, and supply chain and workforce collaboration.”

As part of its resolution, the Building Trades highlighted the large economic footprint that Bruce Power projects have, including creating an estimated 22,000 jobs directly and indirectly from operations, and an additional 5,000 jobs annually throughout the investment program. The Building Trades are proactively collaborating with Bruce Power, site contractors, and the local community to help diversify the construction workforce needed to supply these projects, to include more Indigenous employees, women, returning veterans and reservists, and underemployed youth.

,EVs,2025-10-17 14:57:50+00:00,InsideEVs,'That Goal Has Been Achieved': Norway's Shift To EVs Is Nearly Complete - InsideEVs,Andrei Nedelea,,,,,https://insideevs.com/news/776141/norway-phase-out-ev-incentives/,"Norway's finance minister argues the country's transition to electric propulsion is pretty much complete and the incentive isn't needed anymore.
New EVs bought in the Nordic nation are exempt from import duties, paying road tax, registration tax and value-added tax (VAT).
If you buy a new EV in Norway and it exceeds 500,000 crowns ($49,600), you will pay full VAT for anything above that value.
So if a vehicle costs 600,000 crowns ($$59,500), then you have to pay 25% tax on the 100,000 crowns ($9,920) over the limit, so an additional 25,000 crowns ($2,480).
According to Reuters, Norway wants to proceed toward eliminating incentives because the country has already achieved its EV goal.","Nearly all new cars in Norway are electric now, so a plan to phase out subsidies is underway. There's now a proposal to phase out a tax exemption for EVs by 2027.

The plan is to lower the threshold for eligibility in 2026 before completely removing this benefit the following year.

Norway's finance minister argues the country's transition to electric propulsion is pretty much complete and the incentive isn't needed anymore.

The end of the $7,500 federal tax credit for electric vehicles in the U.S. was definitely premature since the market is not even close to reaching a turning point in the shift to EVs. It was a useful incentive that made a difference. But in Norway, the EV shift has happened almost completely, so the subsidy phaseout will happen because government officials say the country no longer needs it.

Most new cars bought in Norway have been electric for a few years, and that won’t change once the government no longer actively incentivizes people to go electric. New EVs bought in the Nordic nation are exempt from import duties, paying road tax, registration tax and value-added tax (VAT). The latter alone is 25% so it makes for significant savings for the buyer.

This is all money that the Norwegian government could have collected, but instead opted not to in order to help accelerate EV adoption. And accelerate it did, with EV sales outpacing combustion cars for a few years now. The proportion of new cars that are electric grows from month to month and in September it reached 98.3%. These are pure electric vehicles, so they do not include plug-in hybrids.

If you buy a new EV in Norway and it exceeds 500,000 crowns ($49,600), you will pay full VAT for anything above that value. So if a vehicle costs 600,000 crowns ($$59,500), then you have to pay 25% tax on the 100,000 crowns ($9,920) over the limit, so an additional 25,000 crowns ($2,480).

For an electric vehicle costing 500,000 crowns, Norwegian buyers save 125,000 crowns ($12,400) in tax, which makes it one of the best EV incentives available anywhere in the world. This is before factoring in any of the exemptions, which sweeten the deal further.

Now there is a proposal to lower the threshold for the all-important VAT exemption as of next year, where only vehicles costing less than 300,000 crowns ($29,800) would be fully exempt. EV buyers would pay full VAT for anything over. This means most vehicles among the top 10 best-selling models would no longer qualify, so the price the buyer would end up paying would be significantly higher than today.

According to Reuters, Norway wants to proceed toward eliminating incentives because the country has already achieved its EV goal. The country’s finance minister, Jens Stoltenberg, said ""We have had a goal that all new passenger cars should be electric by 2025, and... we can say that the goal has been achieved. Therefore, the time is ripe to phase out the benefits.""

The plan is to completely eliminate the VAT exemption by 2027, but the news has been met with resistance from pro-EV groups in Norway, like the Norwegian EV Association. It points to the fact that even though EVs dominate new car sales in the country, 70% of all cars on the road still burn fuel—so it’s hard to say that the shift to EVs has been completed. It's going to take a long time to replace all of them, if that can even be done.

All these benefits have definitely helped Norway go electric more quickly than without them. The same is true in the U.S., where the federal tax credit resulted in more EV purchases. Now that it’s been phased out, the rate of EV adoption in the U.S. will slow down, although it did see a final spike in September, the last month when people could still claim $7,500 on a new EV or up to $4,000 if they were buying used.

Meanwhile, Germany has announced plans to reintroduce a new EV subsidy program in the form of a purchase incentive of up to €4,000 ($4,675) starting in 2026. The only caveat is that buyers here will be eligible depending on their income.

Germany’s EV incentive is relatively small by European standards, as many countries will subsidize up to €10,000, although usually not more than half of the vehicle’s value and some places like Romania require you to scrap an old car to qualify for the incentive.",https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/P3oZO4/s1/hyundai-ioniq-5-powers-reindeer-farm-in-northern-norway.jpg,N,,2025-10-17 13:11:09.359415

The State of Michigan and 23 other grant recipients also filed suit in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims to recover damages (PDF) for the EPA’s unlawful breach of the grant agreements that were executed under this program.

Congress created the Solar for All program in 2022 as part of the Inflation Reduction Act, directing the EPA to make competitive grants to states and other entities to deploy solar projects in low-income and disadvantaged areas. The EPA selected recipients and awarded all of the program funds to plaintiff states and other grant recipients by August 2024. Michigan and the other plaintiffs moved forward with planning projects and working with stakeholders to develop their solar programs, but the EPA abruptly and unlawfully terminated the program two months ago and clawed back the vast majority of the money already awarded. That has left Michigan and the other plaintiffs without access to the funds to proceed with their solar programs, after the states spent significant time planning and launching programs and committing state funds.

In 2024, Michigan’s Solar for All program was awarded approximately $156 million by the EPA. The Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy selected and announced 13 pilot projects across the state to begin implementing Solar for All-funded initiatives, with a second round of grantees planned for 2025. The loss of $156 million in federal funding has halted these projects and denied disadvantaged communities across Michigan the benefits the program was designed to deliver.

“The Trump Administration’s decision to illegally rescind congressionally approved grants – funds that were already being put to work in our communities – is unlawful and deeply harmful to residents across Michigan and the country,” Nessel said. “We’ve seen this playbook from the White House before. The administration has tried to pull the same stunt by canceling congressionally mandated programs, and we stopped them then. We plan to do the same now to ensure the Trump Administration cannot unlawfully strip away these important investments that lower energy costs and make clean energy more accessible to Michigan families.”

“I applaud Attorney General Nessel for standing up for Michigan families and challenging the EPA’s decision to revoke funding for the MI Solar for All program. This program is a critical investment in our state’s energy future — lowering costs for low-income households, creating good-paying local jobs, and helping us achieve greater energy independence,” said Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy Director Phil Roos. “It would expand access to clean, affordable solar energy while supporting Michigan’s economy and American manufacturing. We remain committed to fighting for this program and the thousands of Michiganders it would benefit.”

Attorney General Nessel and a multistate coalition alleged in the lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington, among other things, that the EPA violated the Administrative Procedure Act and the U.S. Constitution’s Separation of Powers Doctrine in unlawfully canceling the program.

Attorney General Nessel was joined by the attorneys general of Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Hawaiʻi, Illinois, Massachusetts, Maine, Maryland, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, and the District of Columbia in filing this complaint.

Separately, Attorney General Nessel joined a related lawsuit that was filed in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims. In that complaint, the states and other entities argue the EPA breached the clear terms of the agreements with states and other grantees and violated the duty of good faith and fair dealing in canceling their Solar for All grants. The plaintiff states seek money damages, interest, and fees.

Last week, a judge from Louisiana's 38th Judicial District Court effectively halted construction of Commonwealth LNG by ordering state regulators to analyze the facility's climate change and environmental justice-related impacts, in conjunction with the broader LNG buildout in southwest Louisiana's Cameron Parish.

Three of the nation's eight existing LNG export terminals are located in Cameron Parish, and several more are proposed or under construction there.

Louisiana's attorney general vowed to appeal the ruling, which vacated the Louisiana Department of Conservation and Energy's coastal use permit for the facility.

""This is the first time any court has vacated a permit for an LNG facility based on the government's refusal to consider climate change impacts,"" said Clay Garside, an attorney representing the Sierra Club and other environmental groups.

Earlier this year, Trump reversed a Biden-era pause on exports of liquefied natural gas, or LNG, as part of his goal to boost natural gas exports and promote ""energy dominance.""

Last year, the Biden administration's Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm's had warned that ""unfettered exports"" of liquefied natural gas would increase planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions — a statement reflecting the findings of a Department of Energy report released in December.

Trump-appointed Energy Secretary Chris Wright, a fossil fuel executive, has moved to fast-track the buildout of LNG facilities, including Commonwealth LNG, which received an export authorization within weeks of Trump's inauguration.

""Cameron Parish is ground zero for the relentless expansion of the gas export industry,"" said Anne Rolfes, founder of the Louisiana Bucket Brigade, an environmental group involved in the litigation. ""We're going to stop it and this is an important step in that process.""

Lyle Hanna, a Commonwealth LNG spokesperson, said that ""we are disappointed with the District Court's decision, and we are exploring all available legal options.""

A spokesperson for the Louisiana Department of Conservation and Energy declined to comment, citing the potential of pending litigation. Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill said that the state planned to appeal.

""Sadly even state court judges are not immune from climate activism,"" Murrill said.

Last year, a federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., had ordered the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to reassess Commonwealth LNG's air pollution, including its greenhouse gas emissions. In June, the commission gave the project a greenlight on the grounds that its construction was in the public interest.

In regulatory filings, the Louisiana Department of Conservation and Energy said that ""climate change is currently beyond the scope"" of the state's regulatory review.

But District Judge Penelope Richard rejected this position, saying state environmental regulators have a duty to consider how the LNG facility, along with others clustered nearby, would impact extreme weather events, storm severity and sea-level rise in a state where a football field-worth of land disappears every 100 minutes.

Richard also ordered state regulators to analyze the facility's impacts on local communities, especially those living in poverty or relying on fishing for their livelihoods — which she noted was the ""defining characteristic"" of the parish. While the facility could destroy marshes, harm water quality and displace residents, the judge wrote, ""none of it was considered in terms of impacts on environmental justice communities.""

Commercial fisherman Eddie LeJuine, a lifelong Cameron Parish resident, applauded the ruling. He said the buildout of LNG infrastructure, including dredging for shipping channels, has significantly harmed the fishing industry.

""The fishermen are barely hanging on with a thread,"" LeJuine said. ""These plants are killing the estuary and killing our livelihoods. We're getting extinct.""

In August, a dredging channel being developed by LNG firm Venture Global leaked into a nearby estuary. Local fishermen like LeJuine say the onslaught of saltwater and sediment will kill off large amounts of oyster, crab and fish.

Venture Global, which is in the process of constructing a second LNG export terminal in the parish, said it is ""committed to conservation"" and is working with state regulators and the community to respond to the incident.",https://img.manufacturing.net/mindful/im/workspaces/default/uploads/2025/10/lng.rcSNNyT8cu.jpg?auto=format%2Ccompress&crop=focalpoint&fit=max&fp-x=0.56&fp-y=0.25&q=70&w=1200,N,,2025-10-17 15:03:52.606706

Electric vehicles made up 11% of total new car purchases during those months, topping the earlier peak of 8.7%. Buyers flooded showrooms before federal tax incentives disappeared at the end of September.

The sales boom showed that a strong appetite exists for electric transportation among American drivers. Sticker prices have come down enough that 11 different electric models now sell for less than what the typical new car costs. The Chevrolet Equinox carries a starting price near $35,000, while Chevy's redesigned Bolt sells for $29,000.

Switching to electric vehicles improves air quality nationwide. Fewer gasoline-burning engines on roads means less pollution is released into the air people breathe.

Result: UNDERVALUED Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests General Motors is undervalued by 36.2%.
Comparing GM’s current multiple of 8.4x to its Fair Ratio of 15.1x, the company still trades at a significant discount.","If you are eyeing General Motors stock and wondering whether now is the right moment to jump in or hold tight, you are not alone. The stock has been on quite the ride lately, with headlines buzzing about potential changes that could shift the whole industry landscape. In just the past week, GM’s share price climbed 2.5%, even after dipping a bit over the last 30 days. Zooming out, the picture gets even more interesting: up 11.6% since the start of the year, 17.4% over the past twelve months, and a massive 77% in the last three years. Clearly, something is in motion.

So, what is driving this? Two developments stand out. First, the White House is preparing to ease tariffs for automakers, which could mean lower costs and higher margins for GM in the future. Second, GM’s bet on producing rare-earth magnets in the U.S. is paying off, putting the company in a strong position with supply chain advantages that few rivals can match. Although not every plan went smoothly, with GM recently scrapping a last-minute strategy around electric vehicle tax credits, the overall sentiment around risk appears to be changing to the company’s benefit.

When we turn to valuation, GM scores an impressive 5 out of 6 on our value checklist, signaling that the stock may still be flying under the radar for many investors. But numbers alone only tell part of the story. Next, we will look at how each valuation approach weighs in, and why there might be an even better way to assess the company’s true worth than you might expect.

Approach 1: General Motors Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis

The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is designed to estimate a company’s intrinsic value by projecting its future cash flows and discounting them back to present-day dollars. For General Motors, analysts start by looking at its current Free Cash Flow, which over the last twelve months stands at $13.05 billion. This figure sets the benchmark for future growth scenarios.

Forecasts suggest that by 2029, General Motors’ annual Free Cash Flow will be about $8.6 billion. Analyst estimates for the next five years show some variance, with cash flow projections between $7 billion and $8.6 billion per year. Beyond this period, Simply Wall St continues the projection through to 2035, resulting in estimates of over $10 billion in annual Free Cash Flow within the next decade.

When all these cash flows are discounted and summed, the DCF model arrives at a fair value of $89.84 per share for GM. This figure is 36.2% higher than the company’s current share price. This points to meaningful potential upside and suggests the stock is undervalued at present.

Result: UNDERVALUED

Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests General Motors is undervalued by 36.2%. Track this in your or , or discover more .

Approach 2: General Motors Price vs Earnings

For profitable companies like General Motors, the price-to-earnings (PE) ratio is a widely recognized measure for valuation because it shows how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings generated. As a company’s future growth opportunities expand or its perceived risks decline, its “normal” or “fair” PE ratio tends to rise. This reflects improved expectations for returns and stability. On the other hand, higher risks or slower growth typically lead to lower PE ratios being considered fair.

Currently, GM trades at 8.4x earnings. This is notably below both the average PE ratio for its industry, which is 19.2x, and the average of its direct peers at 18.5x. At first glance, this sizable discount could suggest undervaluation. However, headline comparisons do not always tell the full story.

This is where Simply Wall St’s “Fair Ratio” comes into play. The Fair Ratio for GM is calculated at 15.1x, which takes into account the company’s specific factors, such as growth outlook, profit margins, market cap, and unique risks, alongside its role in the auto industry. Unlike a simple peer or industry comparison, the Fair Ratio aims to tailor the benchmark to what is really relevant for GM, providing a more precise yardstick for value.

Comparing GM’s current multiple of 8.4x to its Fair Ratio of 15.1x, the company still trades at a significant discount. This means that, based on these forward-looking and company-specific factors, GM appears undervalued on a PE basis.

Result: UNDERVALUED

PE ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? .

Upgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your General Motors Narrative

Earlier, we mentioned there is an even better way to understand valuation, so let’s introduce you to Narratives. A Narrative is simply the story you believe about a company, your perspective on where it’s headed and why, backed up by your own estimates for future revenue, profitability, and fair value. Narratives connect the dots between what’s happening on the ground, your financial forecasts, and what you think GM should be worth, forming a clear and actionable investment thesis.

On Simply Wall St’s Community page, millions of investors use Narratives to share their views and track how their expectations compare to the current share price. Narratives help you decide when to buy or sell by highlighting the gap between fair value and market price, so you always know whether the opportunity matches your story. Even better, Narratives update in real time as news or earnings come out, so your thesis stays relevant.

For example, one investor’s Narrative for General Motors might predict robust electric vehicle growth and resilient margins, giving a bullish fair value of $80 per share. Another focused on risks from tariffs and EV adoption could justify a lower target of $38. Narratives let you define, refine, and act on your own investment rationale with confidence.

The site will be powered by a massive green hydrogen and ammonia facility that is set for a 2026 startup date.

NEOM Green Hydrogen Project in Saudi Arabia has reached an 80% construction completion mark

The NEOM Green Hydrogen Project exemplifies the current evolution of the global energy sector. Over the past decade, the global community has seen a significant increase in the renewable energy sector as the world leaves the coal and gas sectors in the rear-view mirror.

The NEOM Green Hydrogen Project is reaching the 80% completion mark across its vast array of facilities, including its wind garden, solar farm, and transmission grid. The project noted the successful delivery and installation of crucial equipment, including wind turbines, hydrogen storage vessels, electrolyzers, a cold box, and pipe racks.

NEOM Green Hydrogen Company boasts that the project is the world’s largest’ green hydrogen-based ammonia production facility run on renewable energy. The project is an equal production joint venture of ACWA Power, Air Products, and NEOM. Air Products, which is a US-based company, noted the progress being made.

“The 4 GW solar and wind power generation sites are scheduled for completion by mid-2026, with first ammonia product availability expected in 2027.” – Air Products spokesperson

NEOM Green Hydrogen Company has initiated a major recruitment campaign for the facility

As NEOM nears completion, the project will need to recruit more employees. In that regard, several job openings have been posted by the project management. The facility has cost approximately $8.4 billion to date and will continue to expand its operational readiness as it nears completion.

In 2016, Saudi Crown Prince and Prime Minister Mohammed bin Salman announced Saudi Vision 2030, which calls for a more diversified economy, society, and culture in the Kingdom. The CEO of the NEOM Green Hydrogen Company has noted that the project aligns perfectly with the Saudi Vision 2030 policy.

“By bringing together top talent from Saudi Arabia and around the world, we are building a skilled team to deliver the world’s largest green hydrogen plant and kick off operations, setting the stage for a cleaner and more sustainable energy future.” – Wesam Alghamdi, CEO of NEOM Green Hydrogen Company

The green hydrogen and ammonia projects emerging from several nations have catapulted the progress of the sector into the stratosphere, with huge solar-to-hydrogen and ammonia projects being planned in countries like Namibia.

Air Products will be the exclusive 30-year offtaker for the project, and will export the green hydrogen in the form of green ammonia to the international heavy industry and transportation sectors.

With the aid of a bicycle, however, the man’s energy consumption for a given distance is reduced to about a fifth.
Therefore, apart from increasing his unaided speed by a factor of three or four, the cyclist improves his efficiency rating to No.
Using heat maps and the addition of a cyclist in a cycle covered with an aerodynamic fairing, Scientific American shows that propelling such a “velomobile” makes cycling even more energy efficient.","Fifty two years after Scientific American first declared a human propelling a bicycle to coasting speed more efficient than salmon, seagulls, or jet planes, the august magazine has revisited an iconic 1973 graph and the results hold firm: the cycle remains the planet’s most energy-efficient mode of transport.

The graph, much reproduced by cycle advocates and engineers down the years, was included in an 11-page article on bicycle technology that appeared in the March 1973 edition of Scientific American. The history-heavy piece edition was by S. S. Wilson, then a lecturer in engineering at Oxford University.

He wrote that the purpose of a bicycle was to “make it easier for an individual to move about, and this the bicycle achieves in a way that quite outdoes natural evolution.”

Wilson argued: “When one compares the energy consumed in moving a certain distance as a function of body weight for a variety of animals and machines, one finds that an unaided walking man does fairly well but he is not as efficient as a horse, a salmon or a jet transport. With the aid of a bicycle, however, the man’s energy consumption for a given distance is reduced to about a fifth. Therefore, apart from increasing his unaided speed by a factor of three or four, the cyclist improves his efficiency rating to No. 1 among moving creatures and machines.”

This extract, and the graph that accompanied it, went on to inspire many, including Steve Jobs of Apple, who used it in a 1980 presentation to explain the efficiency of the personal computer. Quoting the Scientific American article, he said: “What a computer is to me is it’s the most remarkable tool that we’ve ever come up with, and it’s the equivalent of a bicycle for our minds.”

Now Scientific American has updated and re-released what it calls the “classic graphic” that shows that a human on a bicycle—able to coast, or freewheel, without pedaling—remains the world’s most energy effecient traveler.

Using heat maps and the addition of a cyclist in a cycle covered with an aerodynamic fairing, Scientific American shows that propelling such a “velomobile” makes cycling even more energy efficient. (The world speed record for a human inside such a velomobile was set in 2016 by Canadian rider Todd Reichert: he peaked, on pedal power alone, at just a smidgen below 90 miles per hour.)

Tyson Hedrick, a comparative physiologist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill told today’s Scientific American that a cycle “turns a human into [an] hyperefficient terrestrial locomotor.”

ForbesBicycling Booms During Lockdown—But There's A Warning From History

Back in 1973, at the height of the 1970s bike boom, Wilson wrote of the cycle’s human-sized perfection: “It is because every part of the design must be related to the human frame that the entire bicycle must always be on a human scale. The lightness of construction, achieved mainly through the development of the wire-spoke wheel and the tubular frame, was dictated not only by the fact that the machine has to be pedaled uphill but also by the desirability of making it easy to lift. Since the bicycle makes little demand on material or energy resources, contributes little to pollution, makes a positive contribution to health and causes little death or injury, it can be regarded as the most benevolent of machines.”

He continued: “For those of us in the overdeveloped world the bicycle offers a real alternative to the automobile.”

The possible inducements of more cycling are many, he stated, including “cycleways to reduce the danger to cyclists of automobile traffic, bicycle parking stations, facilities for the transportation of bicycles by rail and bus, and public bicycles for ‘park and pedal’ service. Already bicycling is often the best way to get around quickly in city centers.”

He concluded: “If one were to give a short prescription for dealing rationally with the world’s problems of development, transportation, health and the efficient use of resources, one could do worse than the simple formula: Cycle and recycle.”",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/68f2338d99e4ecf085367557/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,N,,2025-10-17 12:16:16.435065

This power is intended for the next generation of artificial intelligence data centres using Energy Transfer’s natural gas network to provide a stable energy supply for Oracle’s growing infrastructure needs.

The VoltaGrid power platform is a modular system with high-transient-response designed to balance speed, reliability and environmental performance.

Developed in collaboration with INNIO Jenbacher and ABB, the platform is engineered to meet the demanding power profiles of AI operations while aiming to reduce the dependency on battery storage.

“This is more than a power deal; it’s a collaboration with Oracle to engineer scalable solutions that dampen swings in AI power demand,” explains Nathan Ough, CEO of VoltaGrid.

He adds: “Together, we’re delivering grid-grade performance with ultra-fast response, zero reliance on battery storage and near-zero criteria air emissions.”

This partnership reflects the increasing energy requirements of AI computing and the data centres that support it. As large-scale AI models continue to expand, maintaining stable and clean power becomes a critical operational challenge for cloud providers.

Addressing unstable power consumption in AI workloads

AI applications place pressure on data centre energy systems.

The power usage fluctuates depending on model size and computational intensity, which can lead to inconsistent loads that affect efficiency and grid performance. This variability is a core challenge for operators of large-scale AI infrastructure.

Mahesh Thiagarajan, Executive Vice President of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, says: “AI workloads are uniquely power-intensive and highly variable, often creating swings in demand. By collaborating with VoltaGrid, we’re engineering innovations that dampen these swings, making AI’s power usage more stable, predictable and grid-friendly.”

VoltaGrid’s modular infrastructure enables Oracle to stabilise the energy supply across its expanding AI footprint.

Mahesh adds: “VoltaGrid’s platform joins OCI’s broad energy portfolio to bolster our leading-edge AI infrastructure with dependable power that can be effortlessly scaled.” The system integrates with OCI’s energy strategy to ensure continuous on-demand power delivery while maintaining compliance with emissions standards.

Utilising natural gas for AI infrastructure resilience

Energy Transfer, a major US energy infrastructure provider, has a central role in the partnership. Its pipeline and storage network delivers a firm natural gas supply to VoltaGrid’s new facilities, providing a dependable source of fuel for sustained operations.

This access to a stable gas supply shows the commercial value of Energy Transfer’s infrastructure in supporting enterprise-scale energy requirements.

The approach also reflects the growing importance of hybrid energy solutions that balance renewable integration with reliable gas-based supply for consistent uptime.

The collaboration allows Oracle to reinforce the resilience of its AI infrastructure without relying exclusively on grid resources.

In doing so, it strengthens data centre reliability across regions with increasing electricity demand caused by AI and high-performance computing growth.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/5e47454f2bbd9c8b19e65a3fd93cdd04:b866909d3852702f201d2a29df095543/nathan-ough-ceo-of-voltagrid.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-10-17 14:11:38.858772

Greenflash Infrastructure, L.P. announced the acquisition of the Rock Rose project, a battery energy storage facility with a capacity of 200 megawatts (MW) and 400 megawatt-hours (MWh), located in Fort Bend County, Texas. This standalone project, currently in pre-Notice-to-Proceed (pre-NTP) phase, was previously owned by Advanced Power. The transaction represents a significant asset transfer within the Texas electricity network operated by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT).

Immediate integration into Greenflash’s ERCOT strategy

The Rock Rose project joins Greenflash’s portfolio dedicated to ERCOT, where the company plans to deploy up to 5 gigawatts (GW) of capacity. According to the firm, the asset was selected for its location, transmission access, and ability to support grid stability. The site is fully permitted and interconnection-ready, with commercial operations targeted for mid-2027 following a Notice to Proceed expected in 2026.

A targeted asset transfer in a high-pressure market

Advanced Power, the original project owner, stated that the sale enables Rock Rose to benefit from accelerated execution in a context of rising energy reliability needs. The project will now be developed by Greenflash, which is focused on large-scale standalone deployments. The Chief Executive Officer of Advanced Power noted the necessity for the Texas market to access operational solutions capable of meeting fluctuating demand.

Rock Rose is designed as a two-hour discharge battery storage facility, built to provide targeted support during peak demand periods while contributing to grid balancing. Greenflash plans to implement the project in alignment with its other ongoing ERCOT developments.

A transaction aligned with portfolio repositioning

This deal illustrates an active trend of asset transfers within the U.S. energy storage sector. Advanced Power is continuing to streamline its portfolio towards complementary segments, including thermal and renewable infrastructure. By selling Rock Rose, it enables Greenflash to capitalise on a ready-to-execute project that is strategic within a large-scale growth programme.

Two years after Germany scrapped its incentives for electric vehicles, a move that triggered a sharp drop in demand as we widely reported, the country is preparing to bring them back. The new purchase program will take effect in January 2026.

Renewed Push For Affordability

The new scheme will be introduced at a pivotal time for the European car industry as it struggles with US-imposed import tariffs and new competition from China.

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz revealed earlier this week that €3 billion ($3.5 billion) will be allocated for zero-emission vehicle purchase incentives through 2029, targeting low- and middle-income households.

It’s understood that the program will offer incentives worth up to €4,000 ($4,600) on the purchase of a new EV that’s priced under €45,000 ($52,600). That is a big change from the previous scheme that had a higher price limit of €65,000 ($76,000).

Importantly, plug-in hybrid vehicles will not be included in the program, although used EVs will, for the first time, be eligible, too according to German media, as reported by Autonews.

Who Qualifies

While some finer details about the program are still being ironed out, an income cap of around €45,000 ($52,600) is expected. While speaking about the new incentives, Social Democratic Party secretary-general Tim Kluessendorf said that “everyone must be able to afford the [electric] transition.”

“What is important to me in designing the subsidy program is that it must benefit the German and European automotive industry in particular,” he added. “The Ministry of the Environment will ensure that this is the case. The future is electric, and we want it to be written in Germany.”

The remark suggests the incentives could be limited to vehicles produced by European manufacturers, though no official confirmation has been made. We’ll have to wait and see if this case, but the local car industry could do with all the help it can get at the moment.

A phasing out of subsidies in China and the end of pre-buying in the US to get ahead of tariffs mean that carmakers’ profits are expected to come under pressure, according to S&P Global Ratings analyst Vittoria Ferraris.

Car sales globally were up 5 per cent in the first half of the year to 37.4mn units, against a forecast of a slight decline, the rating agency said. Growth was strongest in China, where government incentives drove an 11 per cent increase in car buying.

US car sales for the first nine months were up 4 per cent to 12.2mn units, according to S&P Global. As well as trying to avoid tariffs, buyers of electric vehicles (EVs) in the US sought to make purchases before tax credits provided by the Biden government as part of the Inflation Reduction Act were phased out in September.

S&P Global now expects global light vehicle sales to reach about 90.1mn units this year, but for the market to then remain flat for the next two years.

“Europe looks increasingly difficult, especially in the mass market segment,” said UBS analyst Patrick Hummel, pointing to recent production cuts at both Stellantis (IT:STLAM) and Volkswagen (DE:VOW) as demand slows.

Porsche sputters

VW warned last month that its group operating margin would be much lower than anticipated this year – at 2-3 per cent, compared with prior guidance of 4-5 per cent. This is mainly down to a €3bn (£2.6bn) impairment on the carrying value of its 76 per cent stake in Porsche (DE:P911). A realignment strategy for the flagging sports car brand – which has suffered due to much lower sales at home and in China – will cost a further €2.1bn.

Meanwhile, Stellantis said last week that it expects third-quarter shipments to be up 13 per cent year on year, although this would still be a 10 per cent drop compared with the previous quarter, according to analysts at HSBC.

One difficulty for Europe’s carmakers particularly is the increased competition from Chinese manufacturers both in China and at home.

Chinese carmakers have increased their share of the domestic market from a little over 40 per cent to 70 per cent over the past five years, and although Beijing has taken measures to iron out uncompetitive practices, “we are definitely not in a position to say that the price war in China is over”, Hummel said.

He argued that some Chinese competitors are adding features to their vehicles for free, and with sales volumes under pressure “we expect further double-digit per cent declines for the German automakers in the third quarter”.

In western Europe, Chinese brands took a 6.7 per cent share of the market in the third quarter, up from 3.9 per cent a year earlier, according to Schmidt Automotive Research. By September, they had captured an 8 per cent share, surpassing South Korea’s carmakers.

“This can definitely grow further towards 10 per cent over the next year or two. The product is competitive,” Hummel said. Although the European Commission introduced tariffs of up to 45 per cent on Chinese-made EVs last year, Chinese carmakers are finding ways of avoiding these – either by importing from countries that are not subject to tariffs or by assembling more locally (sometimes with European partners), he added.

Another competitive pressure is the rush of new models scheduled to launch within the next couple of years.

Analysts at HSBC estimate that globally 900 new models are due to be brought to market by the end of 2027, with the peak of new arrivals landing next year.

“Rather than the typical refresh cycle, the current launch extravaganza is borne out of necessity to bring more affordable EVs to market,” said HSBC analyst Pushkar Tendolkar in a recent note.

The main problem with this is that given the competitive nature of the market, the typical boost carmakers get from launching new vehicles “could be muted in this cycle”, Tendolkar warned.

Hummel also pointed to the risks of increasing fragmentation in regional requirements, with the rolling back of CO₂ emissions regulations in the US, higher trade barriers between the US, Europe and China and issues around data privacy and protection that mean “it’s near impossible to have one global software stack” for cars, he said.

Over time, he expects that regulators in Europe may require Chinese carmakers to develop more of their vehicles locally, but this would be a difficult rule to enact now “because even the European car industry can’t do without Chinese-made batteries”.

Globally, carmakers trade at 9.5 times forecast earnings for 2026, with Chinese carmakers top of the tree at 13 times, according to UBS.

Consultants at McKinsey have argued that Chinese companies “have earned consumer recognition through technology innovation” rather than just price.

But with more than 100 original equipment manufacturers in the market and pricing competition remaining fierce, the higher rating may equally reflect their lower earnings prospects.",https://d2iztrg3kgqpue.cloudfront.net/production/6a08118c-6624-4cc1-9495-10c9ff6e6513.jpg,N,,2025-10-17 15:03:34.424321

This is the first of its kind structure that doesn’t use traditional solar panels or traditional renewable energy systems, but it produces massive amounts of clean electricity. While being a prestigious commercial center, the luxury energy tower is located in one of the world’s most energy-intensive regions, where innovation meets necessity.

Bahrain World Trade Center pioneers integrated wind technology

The installation of wind turbines in sufficient numbers in a commercial building design is the first instance in the world where innovative engineering and architecture truly met with genius. Located in the central business district of Manama, this 240-meter twin tower development has three horizontal-axis wind turbines that are suspended between sail-inspired office structures that take advantage of the consistent Arabian Gulf breeze on shore.

Design Director Shaun Killa from W.S. Atkins developed the idea of using nautical sail expressions to harness the power of wind and create these beautiful architectural forms that will transcend time. The elliptical plan forms and sail-like structures act as aerofoils concentrating the onshore breezes between the towers while producing negative pressure behind the towers, in effect accelerating the onshore breeze velocity.

The vertical sculpting of the towers has aerodynamic values; they have a shape that is aerofoil and tapered upwards, with reducing Aerofoil sections. This construction, coupled with the growing wind speed at greater altitudes, is designed such that there is almost uniformity in the wind regimes of all three turbine levels, and this allows maximum energy generation and minimal fatigue of the blade during the wind skew situations.

Three turbines produce significant renewable energy production

All of the turbines are 29 meters in diameter with a nominal power of 225kW with stall-controlled technology, which limits power generation passively on high wind days. The turbines have a wind azimuth operating range of 60 degrees and automatically switch to the standstill mode when the wind is outside the optimal range.

Revolutionary design produces amazing annual energy yields

The integrated wind system generates between 1,100 and 1,300 MWh of energy per year, which accounts for between 11% and 15% of the office towers’ total consumption of electrical energy. This sizeable renewable energy contribution equates to substantial reductions in carbon emissions equivalent to 2,900 kg carbon from oil-burning power stations or 2,000 kg carbon from gas-burning.

The funneling effect between towers increases the wind speed at the locations of turbines by as much as 30%, with the upper and lower turbines set to generate 109% and 93%, respectively, compared to the middle turbine set to generate 100%. This fairly balanced energy yield shows all the sophisticated aerodynamic engineering that was used in the architectural design. The bridges that connect the towers span 31.7 meters in total and include bearings that have no maintenance services, thus permitting 0.5 meters of movement relative to each other.

Technical specifications:

Tower height: 240 meters (787 feet)

Turbine diameter: 29 meters each

Annual energy output: 1,100-1,300 MWh

Power per turbine: 225kW nominal

Design criticism reveals possible improvements in efficiency

The reversing of the tower can potentially enhance energy production by 14%; Professor Bert Blocken of Eindhoven University was told by measurements in the wind tunnel and the computer that there was a way to do it. His own research indicates that with wind turbines further back, it may be possible to achieve 31% higher annual energy generation.

The Bahrain World Trade Center is a breakthrough in the realm of sustainable architecture by proving the fact that the incorporation of renewable energy can even contribute to the increase in the aesthetic value instead of its reduction. This pioneering project has set a new standard of consensus in integrating wind energy systems in urban, high-rise developments, with the commercial viability and architectural excellence preserved in the difficult desert climate conditions.

Across Europe, renewables are becoming the first line of defence for a bloc determined to bolster its energy resilience.
In response, according to the International Energy Agency’s (IEA) policy tracker, 200 national policy interventions – half ratified in just the last few years – aim to boost domestic critical minerals supply chains13.
Domestic energy security will create global potential.
When Belgium’s Princess Elisabeth energy island is complete, standing lonely but unbowed amid the storms of the North Sea, it will be a powerful symbol of renewables’ new role on the frontline as nations invest to build energy security.","For more than two centuries, energy has been the beating heart of economic growth.

Until recently, most of this energy has come from one simple mechanism – burning things. And as we’ve switched from wood to harder-to-access (but more energy-intense) coal, oil and gas, so our economy has come to rely on a sprawling network of pipelines and trade routes.

This has created some unexpected relationships. In 1997, for instance, just six years after the end of the Cold War, the Nord Stream 1 pipeline was completed, connecting Germany and Russia via the Baltic Sea. At the height of its operation in 2021, Germany was getting 55% of its natural gas from Russia, along with the majority of its coal and oil. At the same time, the wider EU bloc was also buying most of its oil and gas from Russia.1

Today, as deglobalisation continues and the geopolitical landscape shifts, many of these relationships are fraying. Germany and the EU have slashed their energy imports from Russia, aiming to end them entirely by 20272; meanwhile India has come under pressure from US President Donald Trump to do the same3.

The question for investors is, what will replace these routes? Are buyers simply finding alternative sellers, or is a deeper shift taking place?

At Lombard Odier, we believe the world’s energy system is undergoing a profound change. Driven by a desire to achieve domestic security, many governments are seeking not just to re-route their energy purchases, but to build their own home-grown supply. From China to Europe and India to the US, energy independence is increasingly being seen as the best form of defence against a fracturing and unstable geopolitical order.

Renewables – the first line of defence

45 kilometres off the coast of Ostend, Belgium, a world-first construction is underway. Standing as a fortress against the wind and waves of the North Sea, the artificial Princess Elisabeth Energy Island – due for completion in 2026 – will act as a hub taking electricity generated by offshore windfarms and distributing it to the European mainland. The island will also act as an interconnector for neighbouring countries, enabling Belgium to trade renewable energy.

In time, it is expected that Princess Elisabeth will be one of multiple energy islands that could eventually connect dozens or even hundreds of North Sea windfarms, which could collectively meet up to 20% of the EU’s entire annual electricity demand by 20504.

Across Europe, renewables are becoming the first line of defence for a bloc determined to bolster its energy resilience. With huge solar resources in the south (in recent years, Portugal has seen days where its entire electricity demand has been met renewably5) and vast wind potential in the north, the EU already obtains around 45% of its electricity from renewable sources6, and is aiming to achieve the same figure for all forms of energy (by replacing many instances where fossil fuels are currently the end-use form) by 20307.

Other major economies are taking a similar approach. Over the next five years, India is expected to invest more than USD 340 billion to install enough renewable capacity to meet the electricity needs of every household roughly twice over, making up approximately half of the country’s total electricity generation.8 And in the US, despite President Trump’s pro-oil ‘drill, baby, drill’ rhetoric, further strong renewables growth is expected in 2025, with wind, solar, geothermal and hydropower now making up around 90% of the country’s new electricity capacity added each year.9

No one is able to match China, however. Already home to more than 40% of combined global renewables capacity10, China invested a further USD 625 billion in clean energy projects in 2024 alone11, as the country continues its push to become the world’s first ‘electro-state’ and achieve its stated aim of energy independence.

Critical minerals – the new oil?

For many in the West, China’s clean energy dominance has created a new dependency problem. Wind turbines, solar panels, batteries and the millions of kilometres of new cabling needed to transition to zero-carbon electricity are reliant on ‘energy metals’ and other critical minerals, such as aluminium, cobalt, lithium, graphite and rare earth elements.

Today, China is the leading processor of 19 of the 20 most important critical minerals – with an average global refining share of 70%12 – giving President Xi and the Chinese Communist Party a powerful geopolitical weapon. As governments shift away from coal, oil and gas, the risk is that they are merely swapping one dependency for another.

In response, according to the International Energy Agency’s (IEA) policy tracker, 200 national policy interventions – half ratified in just the last few years – aim to boost domestic critical minerals supply chains13.

These include US President Donald Trump’s creation of a ‘National Energy Dominance Council’, which will treat critical minerals supply as a national security imperative14; the respective Canadian and Australian Critical Minerals Strategies; and the EU’s Critical Raw Materials Act, which aims to boost supply chain security by ensuring that, by 2030, a minimum of 10% of the critical minerals it needs are mined domestically, at least 40% are processed in the EU, and at least 25% are sourced from recycling.15

Secure supply chains create new growth opportunity

This global push is accelerating the permitting process for new mines – it is also fostering new innovations aimed at minimising reliance on overseas supply.

For example, New Zealand start-up Mint Innovation’s bio-based recycling process uses bacteria to extract target metals from electronic waste and requires just a fraction of the energy needed by traditional recycling methods – a recent partnership with Jaguar Land Rover to recover lithium, nickel and cobalt from used electric vehicle (EV) batteries has received funding from the UK government16. In Europe, Germany’s BRAIN Biotech and the EU’s Horizon-funded BioRecover project17 are working on bringing similar solutions to scale.

Across the board, metals recycling is set for rapid growth. As demand for critical minerals rises, the International Energy Agency forecasts that the size of the market for recycled minerals could rise five-fold to reach USD 200 billion by 2050, cutting the need for new mining activity for some minerals by as much as 40%.18

Efforts are also being made to sidestep critical minerals altogether, especially in the manufacture of batteries, which have become essential for the grid-scale storage needed to support renewables projects and EV uptake.

Today’s batteries are made using lithium and other single-source-dominated minerals. In April 2024, however, US-based Natron Energy, which has received significant support from federal funds, cut the ribbon on the US’s first-ever commercial-scale sodium-ion battery factory, which employs an entirely domestic supply chain and avoids the need for any hard-to-obtain critical minerals. (Natron’s growth is so rapid that the firm has already announced the site for a new USD 1.4 billion ‘giga-factory’, which will increase its manufacturing capacity 40-fold.)19

Swedish firm Altris is also developing sodium-ion batteries, with investment support from major names including Maersk Growth and Volvo.20 Like Natron, Altris’s batteries can be made from an exclusively domestic supply chain, and are largely reliant on abundant materials such as iron, salt, and even wood21. BloombergNEF forecasts that sodium-ion batteries will represent 15% of the energy storage market by 2035, up from 1% today.22

Domestic security – global potential

As global tensions mount, and multipolar dynamics deepen, it’s easy for investors to imagine a world in which nations are ‘hunkering down’ and investment opportunities diminishing.

At Lombard Odier, we believe this is to miss the bigger picture. We understand that the changing world order simply means a reshaping of where opportunities are to be found, and that as governments take measures to secure strategic industries we will see a tidal wave of new investment from both the public and private sectors.

As the world’s biggest powers invest in national energy resilience, they are building new export markets that will replace today’s fossil fuel networks. Incumbent oil exporters will see revenues fall, while winners will emerge from those offering the solutions that help nations bolster their renewable supply.

The opportunities will be many and varied – new battery technologies, metals recycling, the export of renewably-generated electricity, and high-voltage-direct-current electricity cabling (of which European companies are the world’s leading manufacturers). Domestic energy security will create global potential.

When Belgium’s Princess Elisabeth energy island is complete, standing lonely but unbowed amid the storms of the North Sea, it will be a powerful symbol of renewables’ new role on the frontline as nations invest to build energy security.","https://media.lombardodier.com/image/upload/f_auto,c_fill,w_1200,ar_1200:627/v1760019276/locom/campaign/2025/fall/defence/RE2025_LOGreen_Defence-EN.jpg",N,,2025-10-17 11:02:38.595193

A total of 223 projects were terminated after a review determined they did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs or were not economically viable, the Energy Department said.
The loan guarantee will save customers money and improve reliability while supporting economic growth in the five states, said Bill Fehrman, AEP’s chairman, president and chief executive officer.
Wright, in a conference call with reporters, distinguished the AEP loan guarantee from a $4.9 billion federal loan guarantee the department cancelled in July.
The loan guarantee to AEP was among those conditionally approved under Biden, a fact Wright acknowledged to reporters.","WASHINGTON (AP/WANE) — The Department of Energy said Thursday it has finalized a $1.6 billion loan guarantee to a subsidiary of one of the nation’s largest power companies to upgrade nearly 5,000 miles of transmission lines across five states, mostly in the Midwest, for largely fossil fuel-run energy.

AEP Transmission will upgrade power lines in Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Oklahoma and West Virginia to enhance enhance grid reliability and capacity, the Energy Department said. The project, first offered under the Biden administration, is meant to help meet surging electricity demand from data centers and artificial intelligence.

Indiana Michigan Power, which is part of AEP, plans to use some of the funds for 29 projects covering more than 1,400 miles of transmission lines.

Ohio-based American Electric Power, which owns AEP Transmission, is one of the nation’s largest utilities, serving 5.6 million customers in 11 states. It primarily produces electricity from coal, natural gas and nuclear power, along with renewable resources such as wind and hydroelectric power.

Thursday’s announcement deepens the Trump administration’s commitment to traditional, polluting energy sources even as it works to discourage the U.S. from clean energy use.

Earlier this month, the administration cancelled $7.6 billion in grants that supported hundreds of clean energy projects in 16 states, all of which voted for Democrat Kamala Harris in last year’s presidential election. A total of 223 projects were terminated after a review determined they did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs or were not economically viable, the Energy Department said.

The cancellations include up to $1.2 billion for California’s hydrogen hub aimed at developing clean-burning hydrogen fuels to power ships and heavy-duty trucks. A hydrogen project costing up to $1 billion in the Pacific Northwest also was cancelled.

The loan guarantee finalized Thursday is the first offered by the Trump administration under the recently renamed Energy Dominance Financing program created by the massive tax-and-spending law approved this summer by congressional Republicans and signed by President Donald Trump. Electric utilities that receive loans through the program must provide assurances to the government that financial benefits from the financing will be passed on to customers, the Energy Department said.

The project and others being considered will help ensure that Americans “will have access to affordable, reliable and secure energy for decades to come,” Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in a statement.

“The president has been clear: America must reverse course from the energy subtraction agenda of past administrations and strengthen our electrical grid,” Wright said, adding that modernizing the grid and expanding transmission capacity “will help position the United States to win the AI race and grow our manufacturing base.”

The upgrades supported by the federal financing will replace existing transmission lines in existing rights-of-way with new lines capable of carrying more energy, the power company said.

More than 2,000 miles of transmission lines in Ohio serving 1.5 million people will be replaced, along with more than 1,400 miles in Indiana and Michigan serving 600,000 customers, the company said. An additional 1,400 miles in Oklahoma, serving about 1.2 million people and 26 miles in West Virginia, serving 460,000 people, will be replaced.

The projects will create about 1,100 construction jobs, the company said.

The loan guarantee will save customers money and improve reliability while supporting economic growth in the five states, said Bill Fehrman, AEP’s chairman, president and chief executive officer. “The funds we will save through this program enable us to make additional investments to enhance service for our customers,” he added.

Wright, in a conference call with reporters, distinguished the AEP loan guarantee from a $4.9 billion federal loan guarantee the department cancelled in July. That money would have boosted the planned Grain Belt Express, a new high-voltage transmission line set to deliver solar and wind-generated electricity from the Midwest to eastern states.

The Energy Department said at the time it was “not critical for the federal government to have a role” in the first phase of the $11 billion project planned by Chicago-based Invenergy. The department also questioned whether the project could meet strict financial conditions required, a claim Wright repeated Thursday.

“Ultimately that is a commercial enterprise that needs private developers,” Wright said. The company has indicated the Grain Belt project will go forward.

Trump and Wright have repeatedly derided wind and solar energy as unreliable and opposed efforts to combat climate change by moving away from fossil fuels. Wright said the Grain Belt Express loan was among billions of dollars worth of commitments “rushed out the door” in the waning days of former President Joe Biden’s administration.

The loan guarantee to AEP was among those conditionally approved under Biden, a fact Wright acknowledged to reporters.

“Not all of the (Biden-era) projects were nonsense,” he said, adding that he was “happy to move forward” with the transmission upgrade.",https://www.wane.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2017/07/507754590604424BB3BF553B1B790C1E_35561226_ver1.0-e1609700625543.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-10-17 13:12:55.238333

“In parallel, the partnership will promote structured dialogue between the public and private sectors on the conditions necessary to build a thriving local manufacturing ecosystem.
“This cooperation will help accelerate the sector’s maturity and improve the design of future energy access interventions.
“Finally, the MoU commits both organisations to joint advocacy aimed at raising the visibility of standalone solar as a vital pillar of Nigeria’s energy strategy.","Sun King, the world’s leading off-grid solar company, has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Rural Electrification Agency (REA) to strengthen cooperation on renewable energy access, local manufacturing, and data-driven innovation.

A statement by the company said that with the enabling support from REA and wider government, it plans local manufacturing facilities that could substitute imports worth $150 million over the next five years.

The agreement, signed during REA’s Nigeria Renewable Energy Innovation Forum (NREIF) in Abuja, was witnessed by the Vice President of Nigeria, Kashim Shettima, and Sun King’s Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer, Patrick Walsh, marking a new phase of collaboration between the public and private sectors in accelerating Nigeria’s clean energy transition.

Sun King currently sells more than 330,000 solar kits every month across Africa, up from 10,000 in 2017. In Nigeria, Sun King’s solar sales have grown from 3,000 kits per month in 2020 to 75,000 per month today, reflecting rapid expansion and growing consumer demand for affordable, reliable power. Sun King expects to triple the number of solar kits it provides across Nigeria in the next few years.

Beyond solar systems, Sun King also designs and sells a growing range of affordable smartphones and energy-efficient appliances, such as televisions and freezers, designed to work seamlessly with its solar solutions and improve quality of life for households and businesses.

The new MoU between Sun King and the REA lays out three core areas of collaboration designed to accelerate Nigeria’s renewable energy transition and deepen local participation in the sector: supporting the ‘Nigeria First’ agenda with local assembly of select high-value products, technical cooperation through the sharing of data and knowledge to improve efficiencies and grow the sector, and joint advocacy to raise the visibility of standalone solar as a critical pillar of Nigeria’s energy strategy.

First, on manufacturing and local value creation, Sun King and REA, the statement said, will work together to advance the government’s ‘Nigeria First’ policy by increasing local participation in the renewable energy value chain.

This, it said, includes exploring the domestic assembly of select solar energy and energy-efficient appliances, creating new manufacturing and supply-chain jobs, and ensuring Nigerians capture a larger share of value from the country’s growing clean energy sector.

“In parallel, the partnership will promote structured dialogue between the public and private sectors on the conditions necessary to build a thriving local manufacturing ecosystem. By sharing practical experience from international operations and manufacturing, Sun King will contribute to discussions on how policy, infrastructure, and investment incentives can best support Nigeria’s long-term goals for industrialisation and renewable energy growth.

“Second, the partnership also prioritises deeper technical collaboration and knowledge sharing between Sun King and REA. Both parties will work to enhance data collection, market intelligence, and analytical insights to improve operational efficiency, expand the reach of energy access programmes, such as the Nigeria Electrification Project (NEP) and Distributed Access through Renewable Energy Scale-up (DARES), and identify gaps in skills and infrastructure.

“This cooperation will help accelerate the sector’s maturity and improve the design of future energy access interventions. These initiatives build on Nigeria’s successful track record with renewable energy subsidy schemes and align with Mission 300, the global drive to connect 300 million people in Africa to electricity by 2030.

“Finally, the MoU commits both organisations to joint advocacy aimed at raising the visibility of standalone solar as a vital pillar of Nigeria’s energy strategy. Together, REA and Sun King will highlight the social and economic impact of off-grid solar — its role in powering homes, schools, and small enterprises — and advocate for policies and financing mechanisms that accelerate its scale-up. This collaboration will help align public and private narratives around Nigeria’s energy future and reinforce solar as a key driver of inclusive growth,” it said.

Managing Director/CEO, REA, Abba Aliyu, said: “Sun King was the largest partner on REA’s Nigeria Electrification Programme. This next chapter goes further, linking energy access, industrial growth, and supportive policy into one unified push for Nigeria’s clean-energy future.”

According to the statement, rapid growth has already seen Sun King create over 12,000 jobs in Nigeria — from solar sales, servicing, and installation to engineering, marketing, and data.

This new agreement aims to supercharge that momentum, supporting job creation and industrial growth through closer collaboration with the government.

“This partnership unites two powerful goals — Mission 300, connecting 300 million Africans to electricity by 2030, and the Government of Nigeria’s industrialisation vision. It’s about making clean energy affordable, unlocking new manufacturing opportunities, and using shared data and insight to build stronger renewable-energy and electronics industries across Nigeria,” Walsh, Co-Founder and CEO of Sun King, said.

Rather than promoting tough reforms to lower health care costs for New Yorkers, he wants taxpayers to shovel even more money to the insurance industry.
Case in point: President Biden’s short-term COVID-era enhanced subsidies for Obamacare that Congress now wants to extend permanently.
If lawmakers truly cared about patients, they’d fight the underlying causes of runaway health care costs instead of clinging to taxpayer handouts.
President Biden’s enhanced COVID subsidies were sold as temporary relief but have morphed into regressive, fraud-ridden handouts for the well-off.","New York families already face some of the steepest health care costs in the nation, with premiums and deductibles eating up bigger chunks of household budgets every year. New York’s Department of Financial Services has warned that Obamacare premiums are climbing in 2026. While insurers initially sought a 13.5% increase, state officials approved a 7.1% rise—still enough to strain working families already juggling rising costs.

Instead of confronting the underlying reasons why health care is so expensive, lawmakers often prefer the political expediency of masking rising costs with more handouts. Sadly, New York’s own Rep. Mike Lawler (R) is opting for this very strategy. Rather than promoting tough reforms to lower health care costs for New Yorkers, he wants taxpayers to shovel even more money to the insurance industry.

In Washington, nothing is more permanent than a temporary government program. Case in point: President Biden’s short-term COVID-era enhanced subsidies for Obamacare that Congress now wants to extend permanently. For the sake of taxpayers, fiscal responsibility, and sound health care policy, Congress should let these expensive and wasteful COVID-era tax credits expire at the end of this year.

First enacted in the American Rescue Plan Act and then extended by the Inflation Reduction Act, these enhanced premium tax credits funnel taxpayer dollars directly to health insurance companies. While Obamacare’s original subsidies were tightly targeted to help lower-income families afford coverage, President Biden’s enhanced premium tax credits flipped that logic on its head and extended government largesse to upper-income households who need it least.

Biden’s COVID subsidies effectively scrapped the income cap, so now even high-earning families making six figures—or more than half a million dollars in some cases—can get taxpayer help with their health insurance. Even individuals pulling in over $250,000 qualify. Obamacare was meant to help the poor afford coverage, not hand out benefits to the wealthy.

Instead of allowing these credits to expire as intended, Democrats made their extension a red-line demand in government funding negotiations. Washington is in a government shutdown because Democrats prioritized preserving costly COVID-era subsidies over keeping the government open. The public health emergency is long over, and these pandemic credits should have ended too.

Continuing these credits comes at a huge cost to taxpayers. Extending them permanently would cost nearly $40 billion per year, more than the Department of Justice’s total budget, according to the Congressional Budget Office. With deficits near $2 trillion and interest payments rising fast, the government cannot continue to spend as if the debt doesn’t matter.

Beyond the cost, these expanded subsidies are rife with fraud and abuse. By sending billions to households with little financial need, the program encourages misreporting income and gaming the system. The IRS Inspector General reports a 26% improper payment rate—the highest of any federal health program.

To make matters worse, government data show millions of exchange enrollees never filed a single claim in 2024. Among fully subsidized enrollees, 40% had zero claims. In addition to wasting taxpayer funds, this gargantuan amount of fraud and improper enrollment erodes public trust in government.

Eager to keep their government handouts, insurance lobbyists have resorted to a dishonest campaign of fear-mongering in an attempt to strong-arm Congress into extending these enhanced subsidies. The end of Biden’s COVID sweeteners won’t leave people stranded since Obamacare’s original subsidies still pick up most of the tab for lower-income families.

Remember, the entire Obamacare subsidy is not on the chopping block—only what was expanded in 2021. For almost all enrollees under 250% of the federal poverty line, taxpayers will continue to cover the vast majority of premiums after the enhanced subsidies expire.

Notwithstanding the spin, nearly three-quarters of all current Obamacare enrollees fall under this category. If lawmakers truly cared about patients, they’d fight the underlying causes of runaway health care costs instead of clinging to taxpayer handouts.

These bigger subsidies don’t control costs, they just mask them. By shielding people from the true price of insurance, the government lets insurers keep raising premiums. After falling from 2019 to 2022, benchmark premiums jumped 3.4% in 2023, showing that subsidies don’t stop costs from rising. Rather than sticking taxpayers with the bill, Washington should pursue real fixes: more competition, less red tape, and accountability for insurers and providers.

President Biden’s enhanced COVID subsidies were sold as temporary relief but have morphed into regressive, fraud-ridden handouts for the well-off. Letting them expire isn’t radical—it’s common sense. Congress should end this costly experiment and return Obamacare to its original purpose: helping the poor afford coverage, not padding the profits of insurance companies or subsidizing the upper-middle class.",https://rocklandtimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/city400_20-_20Rockland_20County_20New_20York_1200x1200.jpg,N,,2025-10-17 10:00:28.440953

These specialized materials possess unique properties essential for clean energy technologies, characterised by their supply vulnerability and strategic economic importance. Furthermore, understanding the critical minerals energy transition landscape is crucial for investors and policymakers alike.

Unlike traditional commodities such as oil or steel, critical minerals face significant supply chain risks due to geographic concentration of production and limited global processing capabilities. Lithium, cobalt, nickel, copper, and rare earth elements form the backbone of technologies that cannot easily substitute these materials without substantial performance compromises.

The strategic importance of these materials extends beyond simple economic metrics. Recent discussions at international forums highlight their central role in energy transformation. South African government officials confirmed that critical minerals dominated G20 energy transitions group meetings in October 2025, with broad agreement that energy transition will be fundamentally driven by access to these materials.

Understanding Critical Minerals and Their Role in Modern Energy Systems

Key Characteristics Defining Critical Minerals

Critical minerals exhibit several defining characteristics that separate them from conventional raw materials:

• High economic importance for deploying clean energy infrastructure at scale

• Supply chain vulnerabilities stemming from concentrated production sources

• Limited substitutability in critical applications without performance degradation

• Strategic national security implications for energy independence

Consequently, these characteristics make critical minerals essential for any comprehensive investing guide 2025 strategy.

How Critical Minerals Enable Global Energy Transformation

The fundamental shift toward renewable energy systems demands mineral-intensive technologies requiring substantially more raw materials than conventional fossil fuel infrastructure. This transformation creates unprecedented demand for specific minerals across multiple technology categories.

Technology-Specific Mineral Dependencies

Clean Energy Technology Primary Critical Minerals Required Mineral Intensity vs Conventional Energy Electric Vehicle Batteries Lithium, cobalt, nickel, graphite 6x more minerals than internal combustion engines Wind Power Generation Rare earth elements, copper, steel 9x more minerals than natural gas plants Solar Photovoltaic Systems Silver, silicon, copper, aluminum 4x more minerals than gas-fired generation Grid-Scale Energy Storage Lithium, vanadium, cobalt 16x more minerals than conventional backup power

Data compiled from International Energy Agency clean energy transition analyses

The scale of mineral requirements becomes apparent when examining individual technologies. A single electric vehicle battery demands approximately 8 kilograms of lithium, 35 kilograms of nickel, 20 kilograms of manganese, and 14 kilograms of cobalt. Meanwhile, offshore wind installations require 15 times more minerals than equivalent fossil fuel generation capacity, primarily for copper wiring, rare earth permanent magnets, and specialised steel components.

Digital Technology Integration Complexity

The clean energy transition involves more than traditional power generation equipment. Modern renewable energy systems increasingly rely on microprocessor and digital technologies for optimisation and control. Wind farms, battery storage systems, and smart grid infrastructure all depend on sophisticated digital control systems requiring additional critical minerals beyond their primary energy functions.

This digital dependency creates a secondary layer of mineral demand often overlooked in traditional analyses. Semiconductor manufacturing, essential for renewable energy control systems, requires 17 different rare earth elements alongside specialised materials like gallium, germanium, and indium.

Explosive Demand Growth Projections for Critical Minerals

Unprecedented Scale of Demand Increases

International Energy Agency forecasts reveal dramatic demand growth trajectories through 2040 across key critical minerals:

Lithium: 42-fold increase driven primarily by electric vehicle battery production and grid-scale energy storage deployment

Graphite: 25-fold increase for battery anode materials in both automotive and stationary applications

Cobalt: 21-fold increase for high-performance battery cathode chemistry requirements

Nickel: 19-fold increase supporting battery energy density improvements and stainless steel demand

Rare Earth Elements: 7-fold increase for permanent magnet applications in wind turbines and electric motors

These projections assume successful achievement of global climate targets requiring massive clean energy infrastructure deployment. The scale represents the largest raw material demand surge in modern industrial history.

Regional Demand Distribution Patterns

Asia-Pacific Region: Dominates global battery manufacturing capacity and leads electric vehicle adoption rates, creating concentrated regional demand

North America: Focuses on grid modernisation and renewable energy deployment with emphasis on supply chain localisation

Europe: Pursues aggressive decarbonisation targets through industrial electrification and renewable energy mandates

Emerging Markets: Emphasises electricity access expansion and clean energy infrastructure development

Recent data from South Africa illustrates regional energy transformation challenges. The country's electricity sector expects continued growth with no job losses anticipated, as decarbonisation efforts require both traditional and clean electricity generation. This dual requirement creates complex mineral demand patterns beyond simple renewable energy deployment.

Critical Vulnerabilities in Mineral Supply Chains

Geographic Concentration Creating Systemic Risk

Critical mineral supply chains exhibit extreme geographic concentration that creates significant vulnerabilities for global energy transition efforts. However, Australia's minerals reserve strategy offers one approach to addressing these challenges.

China's Dominant Processing Position:

• 60% of global lithium processing and refining capacity

• 80% of rare earth element separation and purification

• 70% of battery-grade mineral processing facilities

• 75% of lithium-ion battery cell manufacturing capacity

Regional Mining Concentration Patterns:

• Lithium Production: Australia (52%), Chile (25%), China (13%)

• Cobalt Extraction: Democratic Republic of Congo (70%), Russia (4%), Australia (3%)

• Rare Earth Mining: China (60%), United States (16%), Myanmar (11%)

Processing Bottlenecks as Primary Constraints

While mining operations can scale relatively quickly with sufficient investment, establishing processing and refining facilities represents the most significant constraint in critical mineral supply chains. New refining capacity development typically requires:

• 5-10 year development timelines from project conception to commercial production

• Specialised technical expertise concentrated in relatively few countries globally

• Capital investments ranging from $1-5 billion per major processing facility

• Environmental permitting processes that can extend project timelines significantly

These processing constraints create strategic vulnerabilities even when diversified mining sources exist. Raw material extraction represents only the first step in complex value chains requiring sophisticated industrial infrastructure.

National and International Policy Response Strategies

United States Strategic Initiatives

The Inflation Reduction Act, while enacted under the previous administration, continues influencing critical mineral policies through 2025. Key provisions include substantial clean energy investment incentives, tax benefits for domestic mineral processing development, and frameworks for strategic partnerships with allied nations producing critical minerals.

However, the current political landscape may affect implementation priorities and funding allocations for these programs. Fast-track permitting processes for strategic mineral projects remain under policy review.

European Union Critical Raw Materials Framework

The European Union's Critical Raw Materials Act establishes ambitious targets including 10% domestic production requirements by 2030 and 25% recycling targets for key strategic minerals. The €3 billion European Raw Materials Alliance represents significant funding for supply chain development initiatives.

Strategic partnerships with resource-rich nations form a cornerstone of EU policy, emphasising diversification away from concentrated supply sources while building processing capabilities within European borders.

Australian Resource Development Strategy

Australia's $2 billion Critical Minerals Facility focuses on developing domestic processing capabilities beyond traditional raw material exports. The strategy emphasises value-added manufacturing, research partnerships with international institutions, and export market diversification programs.

International Cooperation Mechanisms

The Minerals Security Partnership coordinates supply chain resilience efforts among major economies through:

• Joint infrastructure investment in processing facilities across multiple countries

• Shared technical standards and certification systems for sustainable mining practices

• Coordinated strategic stockpiling approaches for supply security

• Alternative supply route development reducing single-point-of-failure risks

Environmental Impact Challenges in Mineral Extraction

Water Resource Consumption and Scarcity

Critical mineral extraction operations often occur in water-stressed regions, creating significant environmental pressures that complicate sustainable development efforts. In addition, addressing these challenges requires comprehensive mining sustainability transformation approaches.

Lithium Brine Operations:

• Consume approximately 500,000 gallons of water per ton of lithium produced

• Concentrated primarily in arid South American salt flat regions

• Impact local groundwater systems and fragile desert ecosystem balance

Copper Mining Water Requirements:

• Require 200-300 tons of water per ton of refined copper

• Generate acid mine drainage risks affecting watershed quality

• Compete with agricultural and municipal water needs in mining regions

Biodiversity and Ecosystem Disruption

Expanding mineral extraction threatens sensitive ecosystems across multiple continents:

• Deep-sea mining for polymetallic nodules containing cobalt and rare earth elements risks disrupting unknown marine ecosystems

• Rainforest operations in the Amazon basin threaten biodiversity hotspots while accessing mineral deposits

• Desert mining activities disrupt fragile arid ecosystem balance with long-term recovery challenges

Environmental impact assessments increasingly recognise these trade-offs between clean energy deployment and ecosystem preservation, requiring more sophisticated approaches to sustainable mineral extraction.

Circular Economy Solutions for Supply Constraints

Battery Recycling Recovery Potential

End-of-life battery recycling represents a growing opportunity to address critical mineral supply constraints. Moreover, implementing effective battery recycling solutions becomes increasingly vital. Industry projections suggest recycling could provide significant mineral recovery by 2040:

• Lithium recovery potential: 25% of projected total demand through advanced recycling technologies

• Cobalt recovery rates: 35% of demand addressable through battery recycling programs

• Nickel recovery capacity: 20% of total demand recoverable from spent battery materials

Urban Mining Resource Opportunities

Electronic waste streams contain concentrated critical minerals often exceeding natural ore grades:

• Rare earth concentrations in smartphones contain 17 different strategic elements in accessible forms

• Gold content in electronic waste typically runs 40-50 times higher than primary mining ore grades

• Platinum group metals from automotive catalytic converters offer readily recoverable material streams

Design Innovation for Material Circularity

Emerging design approaches aim to reduce primary mineral demand through improved circularity:

• Modular battery architectures enabling easier disassembly and component recovery

• Digital material passports tracking mineral content throughout product lifecycles

• Product-as-a-service models retaining manufacturer ownership to optimise material recovery

• Standardised component designs across manufacturers facilitating recycling efficiency

Technological Alternatives Reducing Mineral Dependencies

Next-Generation Battery Chemistry Development

Research into alternative battery technologies shows promise for reducing critical mineral requirements:

Sodium-ion Battery Systems: Eliminate lithium and cobalt requirements entirely while using abundant sodium resources globally

Iron-air Energy Storage: Utilise widely available iron materials for long-duration grid storage applications

Solid-state Battery Technology: Reduce overall material requirements by 30-40% compared to conventional lithium-ion designs

Aluminum-ion Batteries: Leverage abundant aluminum resources though commercial viability remains under development

Strategic Material Substitution Advances

Material science research enables strategic substitutions across clean energy technologies:

• Rare earth-free electric motors using advanced ferrite magnet designs with comparable performance

• Copper alternatives including specialised aluminum alloys and carbon fibre conductors

• Cobalt-free battery cathodes using iron phosphate chemistry with improved safety characteristics

• Synthetic graphite production replacing natural graphite sources through advanced manufacturing

These technological developments remain largely in research phases, with commercial deployment timelines varying significantly across different applications.

Geopolitical Implications of Critical Mineral Control

Resource Diplomacy Evolution

Critical minerals fundamentally reshape international relationships through new forms of resource diplomacy:

• Strategic bilateral partnerships between consuming nations and mineral-producing countries

• Technology transfer agreements providing processing capabilities in exchange for supply security

• Investment protection treaties safeguarding mineral supply chain infrastructure investments

• Trade agreement provisions incorporating mineral security alongside traditional economic considerations

Emerging Geopolitical Power Dynamics

Countries controlling critical mineral resources gain enhanced international leverage comparable to historical oil producer influence:

• Chile and Argentina dominate lithium triangle resources controlling global lithium supply fundamentals

• Democratic Republic of Congo holds majority global cobalt reserves creating supply concentration risks

• Indonesia rapidly expands nickel processing capacity while implementing export restrictions

• Australia maintains diverse critical mineral portfolio across multiple strategic materials

The South African context illustrates these dynamics, as the country balances energy security needs with climate commitments. Government officials acknowledge the complex challenge of maintaining current energy supply while transitioning to lower-carbon systems, requiring careful diplomatic and economic balancing.

Investment Landscape and Market Opportunities

Market Scale and Growth Trajectory

The critical minerals sector represents unprecedented investment opportunities driven by clean energy transition requirements:

• Current global market value: Estimated at $320 billion across all critical mineral categories

• 2030 projected market size: $750 billion reflecting accelerated clean energy deployment

• Annual growth rates: 12-15% sustained growth expected through 2040

Strategic Investment Categories

Upstream Development Opportunities:

• Exploration and resource development projects in underexplored regions

• Advanced extraction technology deployment improving recovery rates

• Processing and refining facility development reducing geographic concentration

Midstream Infrastructure Investments:

• Battery manufacturing capacity expansion across multiple regions

• Recycling infrastructure development creating circular material flows

• Supply chain logistics optimisation reducing transportation bottlenecks

Downstream Application Markets:

• Energy storage system deployment supporting grid modernisation

• Electric vehicle manufacturing capacity expansion

• Renewable energy project development creating sustained mineral demand

Regional Investment Context

The South African energy sector illustrates investment complexities in emerging markets. The country's oil and gas industry contributes over 250,000 jobs while facing infrastructure challenges including refinery closures and distribution system reliability issues.

This economic reality demonstrates the investment challenge of balancing immediate energy security needs with long-term clean energy transition goals. Countries require substantial capital for both maintaining existing energy systems and building new clean energy infrastructure simultaneously.

Navigating the Critical Minerals Challenge

Critical minerals in energy transition represent both unprecedented opportunity and significant risk for global decarbonisation efforts. The scale of demand growth creates massive market opportunities while supply chain vulnerabilities and environmental concerns require coordinated international responses. Additionally, insights from UNEP's critical energy transition minerals report highlight the urgency of addressing these challenges.

Success in managing this transition depends on several critical factors:

Supply Chain Diversification: Moving beyond current geographic concentrations through strategic partnerships and infrastructure development across multiple regions and countries.

Circular Infrastructure Investment: Creating comprehensive recycling systems that transform waste streams into valuable material inputs, reducing primary extraction pressures.

Alternative Technology Development: Advancing research into materials and technologies that reduce dependencies on the most constrained critical minerals without compromising performance.

Environmental Standards Integration: Ensuring responsible mining practices that balance clean energy deployment with ecosystem protection and social equity.

International Cooperation Frameworks: Building collaborative approaches that share risks, costs, and benefits of critical mineral supply security across multiple stakeholders.

The nations and organisations that successfully navigate these interconnected challenges will secure competitive advantages in the emerging clean energy economy. Those that fail to address supply vulnerabilities, environmental impacts, or technological alternatives risk significant disadvantages in the global energy transformation currently reshaping economic and geopolitical relationships worldwide.

Recent industry discussions emphasise that this transformation requires balancing immediate energy needs with long-term sustainability goals. As energy sector professionals noted at recent conferences, countries face the complex challenge of maintaining current energy supply while simultaneously building the infrastructure necessary for future clean energy systems. This dual requirement creates both investment opportunities and policy challenges that will define the next decade of energy development globally.

It’s time for a National Environmental Protection Act.
NEPA is the process that enables Wilderness Watch, and our supporters, to inform various federal agencies how proposed activities would impact Wilderness and whether they comply with the Wilderness Act.
Because NEPA is merely procedural, it has suffered a death by 1,000 cuts accumulated over the decades.
Yet, the EA’s draft decision claims this behemoth project will have no significant environmental impact.","Our leaders are letting the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) die. But, maybe that’s okay. It’s time for a National Environmental Protection Act.

By the 1960s, century-accumulated costs of “progress” highlighted the need for new legislation. Rachel Carson had documented the effects of pesticides in Silent Spring. American Interstate System construction was bulldozing communities and ecosystems. Ohio’s Cuyahoga River caught fire—again. The Senate Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs opined that we were destroying our environment because of an information deficit, and NEPA would correct this.

A “procedural” statute, NEPA doesn’t mandate less environmentally destructive outcomes. Instead, its language suggests that the authors believed a government, in cooperation with its people, would make better choices with better information: a policy “to promote efforts which will prevent or eliminate damage to the environment and biosphere ….” Congress would execute this policy by requiring federal agencies to produce detailed statements—environmental impact statements (EISs)—on major federal actions. EISs would disclose foreseeable and adverse environmental impacts that could not be avoided and consider reasonable alternatives.

NEPA is the process that enables Wilderness Watch, and our supporters, to inform various federal agencies how proposed activities would impact Wilderness and whether they comply with the Wilderness Act. This has included stream-poisoning projects, predator-killing decisions, and proposals to reintroduce livestock to places in Wilderness where grazing has been absent for decades. Anyone who has commented on a project the agency is considering has likely done so under NEPA.

Because NEPA is merely procedural, it has suffered a death by 1,000 cuts accumulated over the decades.

All three branches of our government and both political parties bear responsibility for NEPA’s demise. In May’s judicial bludgeoning, the Supreme Court of the United States (SCOTUS) narrowed the scope of environmental review with blinders, allowing the U.S. Surface Transportation Board to view 88 miles of proposed railway in Utah without considering how the project would enable upstream fossil fuel production and downstream fuel refining by geographically connecting them. The Court reiterated NEPA as a “purely procedural statute that…simply requires the agency to prepare an EIS—in essence, a report.” In condoning compartmentalized environmental analysis over the bigger picture, SCOTUS summarized how our government regards NEPA nowadays. NEPA is a procedural hurdle on the way to an inevitable project. Sometimes the public can pause it, but only temporarily.

Many agencies in this current administration just transitioned their NEPA regulations into meaningless fluff that disempowers the public, but the accumulation of less flagrant offenses over the years led to this moment. The environmental assessment (EA)—originally created to ascertain whether significant impacts are possible and thus whether an EIS must proceed—has been inappropriately utilized at ever-broadening scales. For example, the Forest Service has recently conducted an EA for a 2.4 million-acre forestwide burn project—which includes 842,000 acres of Wilderness—in the Sequoia and Sierra national forests in California. The project will have no end and will indiscriminately burn Wilderness, roadless, botanical, and research areas. This is the largest intervention and manipulation project ever proposed for Wilderness. Yet, the EA’s draft decision claims this behemoth project will have no significant environmental impact.

In another example, when the public told the National Park Service (NPS) in 2018 that it hadn’t justified how killing half of the mountain goats on the Olympic Peninsula and helicoptering the other half into the North Cascades—impacting eight Wilderness areas— was the best environmental choice, NPS maintained it neither had to identify nor choose the “environmentally preferred alternative.”

One last example: The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) received 34,783 comments on a proposal to build the Ambler Road in Alaska, which would run adjacent to and negatively impact the Gates of the Arctic Wilderness. BLM counted 30,000 of these opposition comments as “one” because they were “standardized letters” with the same text, minimizing that 30,000 people agreed with the ideas in the letter, enough so to spend their own time submitting a copy. These offenses occur regardless of who heads the executive branch.

Congress also has contributed to the fall of NEPA. In the “Healthy Forests Restoration Act of 2003” (HFRA), Congress allowed the Forest Service to designate “treatment” areas without NEPA review, and created categorical exclusions (CEs) that allow logging in those areas, adding more CEs in decades since. The Council of Environmental Quality initially created CEs to avoid NEPA processes for actions with highly unlikely environmental impacts, enabling agencies to avoid environmental reviews for activities like mowing lawns at Forest Service ranger stations. Congress used HFRA to transform this administrative feature into legislative loopholes bypassing NEPA, deeming that 3,000 acres of logging (which underwent EISs in the 1990s) has “no environmental impact” simply because lawmakers don’t want to believe it. The “Fix Our Forests Act” bill pending in Congress elevates this to a macabre level, excising the public and NEPA with “fireshed” designations within which 10,000-acre CEs are permissible— so logging, burning, and grazing may proceed largely unexamined and unchallenged.",https://www.counterpunch.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Mountain-goat-nanny-and-kids-by-Sam-Parks.jpg,N,,2025-10-17 13:11:55.976852

Delays, however, remain a risk.

The Golden Pass venture, backed by QatarEnergy and ExxonMobil, has sought a deadline extension until 2029 after contractor Zachry Group filed for bankruptcy, forcing a partial suspension of construction earlier this year. The joint venture told regulators that labor and equipment bottlenecks have pushed first LNG production beyond 2025, though some commissioning work continues at the Texas site, according to East Daley Analytics and RBN Energy.

Venture Global’s Plaquemines LNG project in Louisiana is targeting late 2026 for Phase 1 and mid-2027 for full capacity after revising its capital cost by roughly $2 billion to reflect higher construction and materials expenses, per Reuters. The developer has secured long-term supply agreements covering nearly all 20 million tonnes per year of capacity, and recently asked federal regulators for an extension to align the project’s schedule, according to the Federal Register notice.

Driftwood LNG, now operating under the name Louisiana LNG Infrastructure, began site work in September 2025 following a change in ownership to Woodside Energy. The $17.5 billion project, located near Sulphur, Louisiana, has received new state and federal permits but remains in early construction with no confirmed commissioning date, according to KPLC News.

Despite schedule uncertainty, the EIA said that most Gulf Coast facilities have reached final investment decisions, backed by long-term supply contracts with buyers in Europe and Asia seeking to reduce dependence on Russian gas.",https://tankterminals.com/wp-content/themes/tankterminals/src/img/favicon/favicon-32x32.png,N,,2025-10-17 11:03:03.922160

For many of the visitors, it’ll be a familiar sight. Chinese brands such as BYD Auto dominate the EV market in Central and South America. They’re a growing presence in Asia. And Chinese companies are among the fastest-growing EV carmakers in Europe, too.

But for those visiting from the U.S. and Canada, the cars may seem a little unusual — as the two countries have used high tariffs to dissuade Chinese EV companies from entering their markets.

While the protectionist strategy may work for now, industry analysts say the rapid expansion of Chinese EVs across the world is just getting started. What that means is that — at a minimum — it soon could be much more difficult for American carmakers to sell EVs outside the United States.

“Chinese cars are pouring at a breathtaking pace into virtually every nation in every time zone — except the United States and Canada,” wrote Michael Dunne, an auto analyst who follows China’s car market closely, in a research note this week. “Never in a hundred years has the auto industry witnessed such explosive growth in exports from a single country.”

The rapid growth could help reduce global greenhouse gas pollution, but it also presents a problem for older, established car companies, particularly in the United States. The Trump administration eliminated regulations and financial incentives that were intended to push the U.S. car industry toward electrification.

In the short term, analysts expect new EV sales in the United States will drop after a record-setting stretch earlier this year. And going forward, the big Detroit companies could find themselves boxed out of China and other growing markets — and struggling against low-price competition in Europe.

“Certainly the Chinese have committed to dominate this marketplace and we are going to have to work harder to compete against them,” said Genevieve Cullen, president of the Electric Drive Transportation Association.

China has spent more than a decade supporting both private and state-run companies that build EVs, manufacture batteries, and mine the lithium and other critical materials needed for the whole process.

As a result, China now has more than 100 car companies, who produce more than half the vehicles sold in the country. EVs, hybrids and fuel-cell vehicles have come to dominate the market, which has cut into sales of Western-made gasoline-powered cars.

Tesla, the biggest American EV maker, saw its sales in China slump through the first eight months of 2025, before making a modest 2.8 percent bounce in September, Reuters reported. General Motors said its sales rose in China in the third quarter of this year, but the company saw its sales drop sharply in 2024.

Meanwhile, Chinese car companies are exporting more vehicles, according to the Associated Press.

Chinese companies have sold 18 percent of the EVs in Europe so far in 2025 — up from 2 percent in 2020, according to data from Benchmark Mineral Intelligence. In the United Kingdom, BYD alone saw its sales grow nearly ninefold in September from the same month in 2024.

In Asian countries outside China, Chinese companies accounted for 30 percent of EV sales in 2025, up from 1 percent in 2020. Across Mexico and Central and South America, EV adoption has been slower than Europe, but Chinese companies sold more than 80 percent of the EVs, up from virtually nothing in 2020, according to Benchmark.

A big advantage for China is its access to the resources and components needed to build EVs.

That’s helped Beijing on several levels; China for example has restricted exports of rare-earth magnets as part of its ongoing trade war with the Trump administration.

Yet the growth of China’s EV sector won’t provide a silver bullet to the country’s climate goals. And it comes with some cost, too.

The country’s EV boom — coupled with growth in wind and solar power — decreased China’s use of fossil fuels by 2 percent in the first half of 2025, compared to the first half of 2024, according to a recent think tank report. But China remains the world’s largest emitter of greenhouse gases. In addition, its auto and battery industries have a history of brutal workplace practices — including forced labor.

Still, Western automakers are watching the growth with alarm.

In Germany, Volkswagen and other carmakers have found themselves with spare factory capacity as the newcomers cut into demand for domestic vehicles, according to the consulting firm AlixPartners.

Ford CEO Jim Farley, who has test-driven Chinese EVs, called the upstart industry “an existential threat.” But if there is a silver lining for the United States, competition from China could spur the U.S. automakers to start producing more, and cheaper, EVs.

U.S. companies already have invested billions of dollars to develop EVs, and prices could drop as production increases, said Ben Prochazka, executive director of the nonprofit Electrification Coalition.

Even so, the industry may still need help to compete with government-supported Chinese companies, he said.

“We all need to be thinking about strong demand side policies that ensure that the U.S. manufacturers could succeed in this global competition,” he said.

U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports will buy the industry time, but there are real risks if the industry doesn’t adapt.

The U.S. could become an isolated market where buyers are stuck with more expensive, gas-powered vehicles while the rest of the world shifts to cheaper EVs, Robbie Orvis, an analyst at the think tank Energy Innovation, wrote in an email.

“Unless U.S. automakers can quickly figure out how to bring down manufacturing costs and improve their vehicle offerings, they will continue to lose market share outside the U.S.,” Orvis wrote.",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/10/7f/359b3e9e4776bc37a199019f631e/brazil-byd-63046.jpg,N,,2025-10-17 12:15:21.387585

Today White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Trump had “found a creative solution to keep the troops paid. And rather than congratulate the president for doing that, this unprecedented action to get our troops paid, the Democrats want to sue him for it. They’re saying that it’s illegal.”

Democrats are saying it’s illegal because it is illegal. The Antideficiency Act, a law that has evolved over time since 1870, prohibits the government from spending money that Congress has not appropriated for that purpose, or agreeing to contracts that spend money Congress has not appropriated for that purpose.

This summer, Democratic senators charged Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem with triggering the Antideficiency Act by overspending her department’s budget, but Trump’s claim that he can move government money around as he wishes is an even greater threat to the country than Noem’s overspending.

There is more at stake here than a broken law.

Trump’s assumption of power over the government’s purse is a profound attack on the principles on which the Founders justified independence from King George III in 1776. The Founders stood firm on the principle articulated all the way back to the Magna Carta in 1215 that the government could not spend money without consulting those putting up that money by paying taxes.

That principle was at the heart of the American Revolution. The 1773 Tea Act that sparked Sons of Liberty in Boston, Massachusetts, to throw chests of tea into Boston Harbor did not raise the price of tea in the colonies; the law lowered those prices. To pay for the cost of what colonists knew as the French and Indian War, Parliament in 1767 had taxed glass, lead, oil, paint, paper, and tea, but boycotts and protests had forced Parliament to repeal all the taxes except the one on tea. It kept that tax to maintain the principle that it could tax the colonies despite the fact they were unrepresented in that body.

Then, in 1773, Parliament gave a monopoly on colonial tea sales to the foundering British East India Tea Company. That monopoly would have the effect of lowering the price of tea. Lower prices should persuade colonists to buy the tea despite the tax, thus cementing the principle that Parliament could tax the colonies without their consent. But colonists protested the maneuver. In December 1773, the Sons of Liberty held what became known as the Boston Tea Party, ruining newly arrived chests of tea by throwing them into the harbor, thus paving the route to the American Revolution.

When leaders from the former colonies wrote the U.S. Constitution in 1787, they made sure the people retained control over the nation’s finances in order to guarantee that a demagogue could not use tax money to concentrate power in his own hands. They gave the power to write the laws to the legislative branch—the House of Representatives and the Senate—alone, giving the president power only to agree to or veto those measures. Once the laws were enacted, the president’s role was to “take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.”

To make sure that the power of the purse remained in the hands of the people, the Framers wrote into the Constitution that “[a]ll Bills for raising Revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives.”

Trump’s declaration that he will ignore the laws Congress passed and take it upon himself to spend money as he wishes undermines not just the Antideficiency Act but also the fundamental principle that the American people must have control over their own finances. That Leavitt suggests giving up that principle to pay the troops, which lawmakers agree is imperative but cannot write into law because Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) will not recall the House of Representatives, echoes the Tea Act that would have thrown away the principle of having a say in government for cheaper tea.

Since Trump took office, his administration has undermined the principle that Congress controls funding. It had withheld funds Congress appropriated, a practice that violates the 1974 Impoundment Act and the Constitution. The cost of such impoundment became evident on Sunday, when catastrophic flooding hit the village of Kipnuk, Alaska, a disaster Andrew Freedman of CNN notes was exacerbated by the lack of weather data after cuts left a critical shortage in weather balloon coverage in the area.

Earlier this year the administration cancelled a $20 million Biden-era Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) grant awarded to the community to prevent flooding. Maxine Joselow and Lisa Friedman of the New York Times noted that when EPA administrator Lee Zeldin cut grants this year, he boasted that he was eliminating “wasteful [diversity, equity, and inclusion] and Environmental Justice grants.”

Now that the government is shut down, Trump has told reporters that his administration is using the shutdown to take funds Congress appropriated away from Democratic districts. Tony Romm and Lazaro Gamio of the New York Times estimate that the administration has cancelled more than $27.24 billion in funds for Democratic districts and states while cutting $738.7 million from Republican districts and states. Speaker Johnson told reporters he thought such withholding was both lawful and constitutional but did not explain his reasoning.

Today Annie Grayer and Adam Cancryn of CNN reported that not just Democratic representatives but also Republicans are out of the loop of presidential funding cuts, finding out about cuts to their districts through press releases. Even Senator Susan Collins (R-ME), the chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, said “we are really not consulted.”

Speaker Johnson told CNN that he hasn’t received details about the administration’s offer of $20 billion in public money and another $20 billion in private-sector financing to Argentina to prop up the government of Trump’s right-wing ally Javier Milei before upcoming elections there.

Trump is also taking control of the previously nonpartisan Department of Justice (DOJ). Yesterday, in the Oval Office, Trump stood in front of three top officials from the DOJ and called for investigations into former deputy attorney general in the Biden administration Lisa Monaco; former FBI official Andrew Weissman, who led the team investigating the ties between Trump’s 2016 campaign and Russian operatives; former special counsel Jack Smith, who investigated and indicted Trump for the events of January 6 and for retaining classified documents; and Representative Adam Schiff (D-CA), who led the House impeachment team in Trump’s first impeachment trial.

Glenn Thrush of the New York Times noted the DOJ officials “smiled, nodded and shuffled in place as he spoke.”

Today a federal grand jury in Maryland indicted John Bolton, who served as national security advisor in Trump’s first term, alleging that he shared classified information in the form of a diary with two of his relatives. That material later informed his book The Room Where It Happened: A White House Memoir, which covered his time in the first Trump administration and so infuriated Trump that he tried to stop its publication.

The grand jury charged Bolton with eight counts of communicating secret information with those not entitled to receive it, and ten counts of having unauthorized possession of documents containing secret information. These charges are similar to those Jack Smith brought against Trump himself, although Trump’s election to a second term stopped that prosecution.

The indictment references Bolton’s criticism of the Trump administration’s handling of secret information, in particular Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s use of the Signal messaging app to plan a military strike on the Houthis in Yemen, especially after a journalist had been added to the call, and Hegseth’s additional Signal chat about the strike with family and friends.

A court will determine the merits of the case against Bolton, but there is no doubt it is intended to send a signal to others in government that Trump will persecute those whom he perceives as disloyal.

Today, Steady State, a group made up of more than 340 former U.S. intelligence officers from the Central Intelligence Agency, the National Security Agency, the State Department, and other intelligence agencies, released a report assessing the state of American democracy. Applying the tools of their craft to the U.S., they assess that the nation is “on a trajectory toward competitive authoritarianism: a system in which elections, courts, and other democratic institutions persist in form but are systematically manipulated to entrench executive control.”

The report, titled Accelerating Authoritarian Dynamics: Assessment of Democratic Decline, finds that American democracy is weakening as the Executive Branch is consolidating power and “actively weaponizing state institutions to punish perceived opponents and shield allies,” and that Congress is refusing to check the president, “creating openings for authoritarian exploitation.”

“We judge that the primary driver of the U.S.’s increasing authoritarianism is the increased frequency of Executive Branch overreach,” the report says, noting that “President Donald J. Trump has leveraged emergency powers, executive orders, federalized military forces, and bureaucratic politicization to consolidate control and weaken checks and balances.”

But the Trump administration is increasingly unpopular. Trump loyalists are working overtime to portray those who oppose the administration as anti-American criminals and terrorists. Today White House press secretary Leavitt told the Fox News Channel that “[t]he Democrat Party’s main constituency are [sic] made up of Hamas terrorists, illegal aliens, and violent criminals,” and administration loyalists have spent the week claiming that the No Kings rally scheduled for Saturday, October 18, is a “hate America rally.”

Joe Perticone of The Bulwark noted that Indivisible, the organization sponsoring the No Kings protests, “has an extensive track record that shows a longstanding emphasis on safety and nonviolence.” Perticone spoke to Ezra Levin, co–executive director of Indivisible, who said: “Go to a No Kings rally. What do you see? You see moms and grandmas and kids and dogs and funny signs and dancing and happy displays of opposition to the regime that are foundationally nonviolent. And on the other end, you’ve got a regime that’s led by a guy who cheered the January 6th insurrection.”

Levin noted that authoritarian regimes fear mass organizing and peaceful protest because they reveal a regime’s unpopularity and show that it is losing its grip on power.

Much as tossing chests of tea into Boston Harbor did about 250 years ago.

One reason for the shift is that Congress has been sidelined from any effort to deal with the fallout as the Trump administration takes the lead.
""What's so simple at the heart of this is should people who have health care in 2025 that's helped by the tax credits have access to that health care in 2026?""
Thune says he has offered Democrats a vote on a proposal to address health care subsidies, but he cannot guarantee an outcome.
Referring to Senate Democrats, Thune said, ""these are not people who want to get things done.","With the Trump administration staving off some of the most painful impacts of the government shutdown, and a federal court ruling pausing layoffs for thousands of federal workers, the sense of urgency on Capitol Hill for a way out of the stalemate may be gone — at least for right now.

In past shutdowns, Congress passed legislation to cover paychecks for the military, while headlines about things like closed national parks and shuttered agencies unable to provide services turned up the heat on both parties.

With this shutdown, the dynamic is different. Day after day, top congressional leaders hold dueling press conferences, but there are no serious negotiations and the House hasn't voted in weeks. Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., says he has no plans for the chamber to return until Senate Democrats break their opposition to a stopgap bill passed by the House to fund federal agencies through November 21.

After a 10th Senate vote to fund the government failed to advance on Thursday, Sen. Peter Welch, D-Vt, said efforts to end the shutdown were ""nowhere."" The Senate wrapped up business and went home, ensuring the shutdown will stretch into a fourth week.

One reason for the shift is that Congress has been sidelined from any effort to deal with the fallout as the Trump administration takes the lead.

On Tuesday, the White House Office of Management and Budget said in a post on social media that it was ""making every preparation to batten down the hatches and ride out the Democrats' intransigence.""

The administration's efforts have taken several forms. The Pentagon shifted money around to cover the Oct. 15 paychecks of servicemembers. The administration tapped $300 million in tariff revenue to keep a nutrition program for low-income women and children operational. And on Thursday, it said it would ensure that 70,000 law enforcement officers across the Department of Homeland Security — including at TSA and ICE — would be paid ""for all hours worked during the shutdown period.""

OMB did not respond to a request for comment about additional plans to cover pay for law enforcement or other federal workers, or what kind of additional layoffs might be announced. President Trump has said ""Democrat programs"" would be cut and face permanent layoffs or closures, but no details have been released yet.

Predicting tough days ahead

Democrats broadly argue that the administration's moves are illegal, and that there's bipartisan support for bills to cover the costs of pay for soldiers and aid for low-income women and children.

And while the administration's efforts may have delayed some pain from the shutdown for targeted programs and agencies, Democrats say the moves are also prolonging the impasse by removing pressure points that served to push the parties to negotiate in the past.

The approach ""may or may not take some pressure off,"" according to Welch, but he said it's not sustainable.

Earlier this week House GOP Whip Tom Emmer, R-Minn., praised the president for ensuring soldiers did not miss their most recent paycheck. But more widespread impacts ""are just getting started,"" he warned.

""Airports will be flooded with flight cancellations and delays amid the busiest time to travel all year, and the list goes on and on,"" Emmer said.

Democrats are using their only point of leverage in the minority — denying the GOP enough votes to advance the stopgap funding bill passed by the House — as a way to force a debate about expiring health care subsidies. They believe the public is increasingly understanding that significant premium spikes are on the horizon if Congress doesn't act, and that could force the GOP to the table.

Rep. James Walkinshaw, D-Va., is among those who believe pressure on the GOP may soon grow. Walkinshaw represents a suburban district outside of Washington with a large number of federal workers.

He says there is currently no legal mechanism to pay air traffic controllers, or a way to address what he described as the unpredictable markets facing farmers due to President Trump's tariff policies.

""Every day that the shutdown continues, it's harder for the administration to try to play whack -a-mole and mitigate impacts.""

November 1 could be a key date

November 1 is the beginning of open enrollment for people getting coverage through the Affordable Care Act. Most states will send notices laying out the cost of coverage without federal subsidies, and lawmakers on both sides openly admit the shutdown could extend for weeks. Democrats believe that could act as a mechanism to change things on Capitol Hill.

""What's so simple at the heart of this is should people who have health care in 2025 that's helped by the tax credits have access to that health care in 2026?"" Welch said in an interview. He said that in Vermont notices started going out on October 15, with some families facing increases of $25,000.

""This is all about all our families, it's not a red state, blue state deal, or who you voted for,"" according to Welch.

Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said he's happy to sit down with Democrats, but he has stressed that any health care deal ""happens after they open up the government."" Thune says he has offered Democrats a vote on a proposal to address health care subsidies, but he cannot guarantee an outcome.

Referring to Senate Democrats, Thune said, ""these are not people who want to get things done. These are people who want to fight Trump and appease all the people who are coming into town this weekend,"" he told reporters, referring to a ""No Kings"" rally sponsored by progressive activists groups opposing the Trump administration's policies.

Democrats see Trump as the only person who can change the current dynamic. Many cite his love of a ""deal"" and the fact that voters in red states who backed him rely on the tax credits more than those in blue states.

""As soon as he gets engaged this thing can resolve within a day or two,"" Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., told reporters on Thursday.

Why Should You Dump AKAM?

Sales trends were unexciting over the last two years as its 5.6% annual growth was well below the typical software company

Gross margin of 59.1% is way below its competitors, leaving less money to invest in areas like marketing and R&D

Customer acquisition costs take a while to recoup, making it difficult to justify sales and marketing investments that could increase revenue

At $73.11 per share, Akamai Technologies trades at 2.5x forward price-to-sales. Check out our free in-depth research report to learn more about why AKAM doesn’t pass our bar.

Microchip Technology (MCHP)

Market Cap: $35.27 billion

Spun out from General Instrument in 1987, Microchip Technology (NASDAQ: MCHP) is a leading provider of microcontrollers and integrated circuits used mainly in the automotive world, especially in electric vehicles and their charging devices.

Why Do We Avoid MCHP?

Sales tumbled by 4.2% annually over the last five years, showing market trends are working against its favor during this cycle

Performance over the past five years shows each sale was less profitable as its earnings per share dropped by 18.5% annually, worse than its revenue

Free cash flow margin dropped by 15.8 percentage points over the last five years, implying the company became more capital intensive as competition picked up

Microchip Technology’s stock price of $64.21 implies a valuation ratio of 37.2x forward P/E. If you’re considering MCHP for your portfolio, see our FREE research report to learn more.

Norfolk Southern (NSC)

Market Cap: $64.72 billion

Starting with a single route from Virginia to North Carolina, Norfolk Southern (NYSE: NSC) is a freight transportation company operating a major railroad network across the eastern United States.

Why Should You Sell NSC?

Weak unit sales over the past two years imply it may need to invest in improvements to get back on track

Anticipated sales growth of 2.7% for the next year implies demand will be shaky

Earnings per share have dipped by 4.5% annually over the past two years, which is concerning because stock prices follow EPS over the long term

Norfolk Southern is trading at $286.51 per share, or 22.2x forward P/E. To fully understand why you should be careful with NSC, check out our full research report (it’s free for active Edge members).

CenterPoint Energy launches cold weather communications campaign to help customers address Energy Information Administration forecast of increases in winter gas costs

INDIANAPOLIS - Oct. 15, 2025 - Today, as part of its commitment to supporting its customers in its Indiana North natural gas service territory, CenterPoint Energy is launching a customer communication campaign encouraging eligible customers to take advantage of a series of support programs, including energy efficiency and bill assistance resources ahead of this winter heating season.

CenterPoint, as well as other Indiana natural gas utilities, is taking action in response to nationwide industry forecasts, including the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) annual Winter Heating Outlook , that indicate that gas customers across the Midwest will see higher residential bills compared to last year, as a result of rising fuel costs. The campaign, which will include social media and direct outreach to customers, is aimed at helping customers plan and prepare for the potential impact of rising fuel costs nationwide.

While the agency anticipates stable year-over-year pricing nationally, the EIA projects higher gas prices in the Midwest due to higher expenditures.

""Given seasonal forecasts, including EIA's, of an increase to the cost of natural gas, we are concerned about the potential for rising fuel prices to impact our customers' bills this winter. While CenterPoint doesn't control the price of natural gas or determine how fuel costs impact customer bills, we are committed to supporting our customers, especially those who may need help paying their energy bill. We encourage all those who may have difficulty paying their bill to plan ahead and take advantage of our customer support programs and energy-saving resources during the winter heating season,"" said Mike Roeder, CenterPoint's Senior Vice President, External Affairs.

Financial Assistance and Customer Support Programs

CenterPoint encourages customers to take advantage of payment assistance options and energy-saving programs to help manage their winter bills, including:

Customer Assistance Fund (CAF): Direct bill support is available to eligible Indiana customers who may be facing financial challenges. Administered in partnership with The Salvation Army Indiana Division and supported by CenterPoint, the CAF features an easy and accessible application process. More information is available at CenterPointEnergy.com/CAF.

Energy Assistance Program (EAP): Income-eligible customers can apply through their local community action agency or online at eap.ihcda.in.gov or call 1-800-872-0371 to find their nearest agency.

Universal Service Program (USP): Customers who apply and qualify for EAP are automatically enrolled for additional bill reductions.

Summary of Key Facts

Utilities are not permitted to mark up the cost of natural gas. Natural gas is a commodity traded in a national, deregulated market, where prices fluctuate daily with supply and demand.

CenterPoint does not control or profit from the cost of natural gas. CenterPoint purchases natural gas on behalf of its customers and then passes those costs on to customers through the gas cost adjustment, which is listed on the bill as ""Gas Cost Charge."" Only gas costs actually incurred and approved by the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission are recovered from customers. Natural gas costs are calculated separately from electric bills.

Industry forecasts, including the Energy Information Administration (EIA) annual Winter Heating Outlook point to higher residential bills this year compared to last.

Due to the forecasted increase in natural gas commodity prices, CenterPoint estimates the average residential household could expect to pay an average of approximately $112 per month over the five-month heating season (November-March), compared to approximately $105 per month last year - an increase of approximately 6% due to the price of natural gas. Actual bills vary with home size and age, number of gas appliances, thermostat settings, insulation and weather.

Natural gas remains one of the most affordable heating sources for most customers in Indiana. In fact, CenterPoint natural gas customers in the utility's Indiana North territory who heated their homes with natural gas last year saved up to $920 compared to those who heated their homes with propane and up to $369 to $1,205 compared to those who heated with an electric heat pump or electric furnace, respectively.

CenterPoint Energy's Indiana North territory delivers natural gas to approximately 634,000 customers in Adams, Allen, Bartholomew, Blackford, Boone, Clark, Clay, Clinton, Decatur, Delaware, Fayette, Floyd, Fountain, Grant, Greene, Hamilton, Hancock, Hendricks, Henry, Huntington, Jackson, Jay, Jefferson, Johnson, Lawrence, Madison, Marion, Martin, Miami, Monroe, Montgomery, Morgan, Orange, Owen, Parke, Putnam, Randolph, Rush, Shelby, Tippecanoe, Tipton, Vermillion, Vigo, Wabash, Warren, Wayne, Wells and White counties.

CenterPoint Energy launches cold weather communications campaign to help customers address Energy Information Administration Forecast of increases in winter gas costs

DAYTON, Ohio - Oct. 15, 2025 - Today, as part of its commitment to supporting its customers in its Ohio natural gas service territory, CenterPoint Energy is launching a customer communication campaign encouraging eligible customers to take advantage of a series of support programs, including energy efficiency and bill assistance resources ahead of this winter heating season.

CenterPoint is taking action in response to nationwide industry forecasts, including the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) annual Winter Heating Outlook , that indicate that gas customers across the Midwest will see higher residential bills compared to last year, as a result of rising fuel costs. The campaign, which will include social media and direct outreach to customers, is aimed at helping customers plan and prepare for the potential impact of rising fuel costs nationwide.

While the agency anticipates stable year-over-year pricing nationally, the EIA projects higher gas prices in the Midwest due to higher expenditures.

""Given seasonal forecasts, including EIA's, of an increase to the cost of natural gas we are concerned about the potential for rising fuel prices to impact our customers' bills this winter. While CenterPoint doesn't control the price of natural gas or determine how fuel costs impact customer bills, we are committed to supporting our customers, especially those who may need help paying their energy bill. We encourage all those who may have difficulty paying their bill to plan ahead and take advantage of our customer support programs and energy-saving resources during the winter heating season,"" said Mike Roeder, CenterPoint's Senior Vice President, External Affairs.

Financial Assistance and Customer Support Programs

CenterPoint encourages customers to take advantage of payment assistance options and energy-saving programs to help manage their winter bills, including:

Choice Program: Through CenterPoint's natural gas Choice Program, customers can choose a natural gas supplier that's right for them. Competing suppliers offer more pricing options for consumers, such as locking in a fixed rate, which allows them to comparison shop for energy the way they do for other products and services. Customers who do not choose a third-party supplier are served by one of five default Standard Choice Offer suppliers at a variable rate. Visit CenterPointEnergy.com/Choice for a list of suppliers and up-to-date prices.

Home Energy Assistance Program (HEAP): State and federal utility assistance dollars are available for income-eligible customers. Households must fall at or below 175 percent of federal poverty guidelines to apply. Visit development.ohio.gov or call (800) 282-0880 to learn more.

HEAP Winter Crisis Program: The HEAP Winter Crisis Program provides assistance once per heating season to eligible households that are disconnected or are threatened with disconnection. Households must fall at or below 175 percent of federal poverty guidelines to apply. Visit development.ohio.gov or call (800) 282-0880 to learn more.

Percentage of Income Payment Plan Plus (PIPP Plus): PIPP Plus calls for a qualified household to pay 5 percent of its monthly income for gas service throughout the year. To be eligible for the PIPP Plus program, a customer must receive his or her primary or secondary heat source from a company regulated by the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio, must have a total household income which is at or below 175 percent of the federal poverty level and must apply for all energy assistance programs for which he or she is eligible.

Due Date Extension and Payment Arrangement: These are two free offerings available to customers in need of a special payment plan to temporarily keep their service connected and better manage energy costs.

Energy Efficiency Resources: CenterPoint offers energy efficiency tips and tools to help customers lower their natural gas usage. Visit CenterPointEnergy.com/SmartSavings or call 1-800-227-1376 for additional information.

Budget Bill: Under this billing plan, a customer's estimated costs for gas service are spread in equal amounts throughout the year. This leveling of monthly bill amounts reduces the need to pay the full amount in the winter and spreads some of those higher bill charges into the non-heating months. Customers can learn more and enroll for free at CenterPointEnergy.com or by calling 1-800-227-1376.

Home Weatherization Program: CenterPoint partners with Miami Valley Community Action Partnership to weatherize homes and helps qualifying Ohio customers implement energy efficiency improvements to their homes at no cost. Households must fall within 300 percent of federal poverty guidelines to apply. Visit miamivalleycap.org to learn more.

Additional details about these customer support programs can be found at CenterPointEnergy.com/ResourceHub or call us at 812-227-1376.

Summary of Key Facts

CenterPoint is not a natural gas supplier. The customer's natural gas supplier and corresponding price per unit of gas can significantly influence bill amounts. Customers can choose a fixed price that won't fluctuate over the winter months. Since natural gas represents nearly half of customers' bills during the winter months, now could be a good time for customers to explore supplier pricing options.

Industry forecasts, including the Energy Information Administration (EIA) annual Winter Heating Outlook point to higher residential bills this year compared to last.

The average CenterPoint customer paid $112 per month for natural gas service during the 2024-2025 heating season for a five-month total (November - March) of approximately $558. Actual bills vary with home size and age, number of gas appliances, thermostat settings, insulation and weather.

Natural gas continues to be one of the most affordable heating sources for most customers in Ohio. In fact, CenterPoint Ohio gas customers who heated their homes with natural gas last year saved up to $942 compared to those who heated their homes with propane and up to $324 to $2,418 compared to those who heated with an electric heat pump or electric furnace, respectively.

CenterPoint Energy's Ohio natural gas service territory delivers natural gas to approximately 330,000 customers in all or portions of Auglaize, Champaign, Clark, Clinton, Darke, Fayette, Greene, Highland, Logan, Madison, Miami, Montgomery, Pickaway, Preble, Shelby and Warren counties.

CLG Europe emphasized that regulatory stability will be essential to sustain the transformation already underway.
“There is tremendous support from businesses and investors for an effective Clean Industrial Deal,” said Ursula Woodburn , director of the organization.
According to European Commission calculations, achieving a 90% emissions reduction target would require doubling the annual rate of renewable energy installation , which stood at 56 GW in 2024 , and tripling the installed energy storage capacity by 2040.
However, companies agree that climate ambition can be an industrial advantage , provided it is accompanied by clear incentives, reduced red tape, and an industrial strategy aligned with the energy transition.","A group of 131 companies, investors and trade organisations urged the European Union to set a 90% emissions reduction target by 2040 , in order to offer a signal of political and economic commitment capable of restoring market confidence and accelerating investment in clean technologies .

The initiative, coordinated by Corporate Leaders Groups Europe (CLG Europe) , was formalized in a letter sent today to the EU institutions, on the eve of the meeting of European leaders in Brussels on October 23 and 24 , where the direction of industrial competitiveness and the future climate framework for the region will be discussed.

The signatory companies—which include players in the energy, technology, financial, manufacturing, and transportation sectors—request that the new legislative package incorporate three core elements:

a net 90% reduction in emissions by 2040 ,

a Clean Industrial Pact that simplifies green investments and eliminates bureaucratic barriers,

and the creation of leading markets with clear regulations, tax incentives, and strategic public procurement for low-carbon products.

CLG Europe emphasized that regulatory stability will be essential to sustain the transformation already underway.

“There is tremendous support from businesses and investors for an effective Clean Industrial Deal,” said Ursula Woodburn , director of the organization.

He explained that the world is experiencing an unprecedented technological revolution, and many companies have already invested in clean technologies in Europe, but “to ensure they reap the benefits of those investments, now is the time to turn intentions into actions that strengthen Europe’s industrial advantage.”

The private sector’s request comes amid an economic climate marked by slowing industrial growth in the eurozone and competitive pressure from the United States and China , which have deployed aggressive policies to attract green capital over the past two years.

The US Inflation Reduction Act , for example, offers more than $370 billion in tax credits and subsidies for manufacturing and clean energy, which has redirected some of the global investment previously directed to the European continent.

In this scenario, the EU is trying to shape a “Green Deal Industrial Plan” to offset the loss of attractiveness and accelerate the electrification of energy-intensive sectors such as steel, cement, and heavy transport.

For María Mendiluce , CEO of the We Mean Business Coalition , Europe still has time to consolidate its leadership: “The continent has a real opportunity to lead the next industrial transformation, driven by clean technologies that strengthen competitiveness, energy security, and long-term prosperity,” she noted.

However, he warned that this leadership “will not be maintained without a clear and substantive policy,” and therefore called for a coherent framework that offers certainty to investors and harmonizes regulation, finance, and innovation across the single market.

According to European Commission calculations, achieving a 90% emissions reduction target would require doubling the annual rate of renewable energy installation , which stood at 56 GW in 2024 , and tripling the installed energy storage capacity by 2040.

Furthermore, it would entail reducing demand for fossil fuels by 80% compared to current levels and an additional investment of €1.5 trillion in electrical infrastructure, smart grids, and local production of critical technologies such as batteries and electrolyzers.

The call’s proponents argue that companies are already mobilizing some of that capital: more than 1,000,000 jobs in Europe currently depend directly on the clean energy value chain, and that number is expected to double if a predictable investment environment is achieved.

In this sense, the proposed Clean Industrial Pact aims to ensure that these opportunities “are exploited on European soil and not relocated to regions with more attractive environments.”

Over the coming months, the proposal will be discussed in the European Parliament and the Council, where some Member States have already expressed reservations about the economic viability of the new target.

However, companies agree that climate ambition can be an industrial advantage , provided it is accompanied by clear incentives, reduced red tape, and an industrial strategy aligned with the energy transition.",https://strategicenergy.eu/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Renovables-32-1.jpg,N,,2025-10-17 10:00:38.134218

The project involves replacing existing transmission lines with new ones capable of carrying more energy.

The upgrades are expected to provide enhanced reliability and facilitate new economic growth opportunities by increasing power capacity in the communities served by AEP.

The company estimates the creation of around 1,100 construction jobs through these upgrades.

Additionally, the project is anticipated to save customers around $275m in financing costs over the loan’s duration, resulting in reduced expenses reflected in their bills.

AEP said it is experiencing a surge in energy demand, with customers committing to expansions requiring an additional 24GW of electricity by the end of the decade.

The enhancements have been primarily aimed at supporting data centres, AI, and manufacturing advancements, signifying generational increase in the electric system’s load.

AEP is exploring federal funding and implementing rate structures to ensure that new large customers contribute to infrastructure investments.

This strategy aims to mitigate rate impacts on existing customers.

AEP chair, president, and CEO Bill Fehrman said: “AEP is experiencing growth in energy demand that has not been seen in a generation. As the first company to close a new loan with the Trump Administration under this programme, we are excited to get to work on these projects to improve the service we provide to our customers.

“This loan saves our customers money and improves reliability while supporting economic growth in our states. The funds we will save through this programme enable us to make additional investments to enhance service for our customers.”

AEP plans to collaborate with local communities and landowners in siting these critical transmission lines.

Until now, we’ve been customers of utilities — with power flowing one way to homes — but more and more we’ll be active participants in the grid, sending extra battery power the other way.
“There’s more energy capacity deployed today in electric vehicle batteries on the road in the U.S. than in all stationary batteries combined,” Rauscher added.
At the same time, ever more data centers are devouring ever more power and stressing the grid to its limits.
“I fundamentally believe that bidirectional electric vehicles are going to be something that no one’s ever heard of, until suddenly everyone has it,” Rauscher said.","Depending on whom you’re asking, renewable energy and electric vehicles will either destroy the grid or save it. The sun doesn’t always shine and the wind doesn’t always blow, true enough, while a gas-fired power plant can generate electricity any time. That supposed precarity of renewables will get even shakier, critics argue, as Americans ditch conventional vehicles for electric ones, which will draw ever more power from an already strained grid.

Luckily, that’s not a realistic scenario because of what renewables and EVs have in common: giant batteries. Solar and wind farms are plugging into huge banks of them to store energy to use as needed, fixing their intermittency challenge. (Engineers are turning Earth itself into an even bigger battery.) And a growing number of cars with cords feature vehicle-to-grid technology, or V2G, also known as bidirectional charging. They can draw clean power when renewables are humming on the grid, and their owners get paid to send some back to a utility to meet growing demand — creating a vast distributed network that could make the electrical system more reliable, not less. Research has found that globally, less than a third of EV owners would have to opt into such a system to meet the rising need for energy storage.

Until now, we’ve been customers of utilities — with power flowing one way to homes — but more and more we’ll be active participants in the grid, sending extra battery power the other way. That shift is getting a head start in Maryland, where last month the Baltimore Gas and Electric Company partnered with Sunrun, which provides home solar and batteries, and Ford, which makes the electric F-150 Lightning, to activate the nation’s first residential V2G pilot project.

“This is the first time there are actual customers who are off-boarding power from their electric vehicles to the grid, and we’re doing it at peak times in the evening,” said Chris Rauscher, vice president of grid services at Sunrun, referring to the periods of greatest need for electricity. “So we’re actually reducing the stress and the demand on the grid — crushing the curve, crushing the peak — which helps lower costs for everyone.”

To understand how this works, think of EVs less like vehicles, and more like immense batteries on wheels. In fact, the Lightning’s battery is 10 times bigger than a residential pack, Rauscher said. “There’s more energy capacity deployed today in electric vehicle batteries on the road in the U.S. than in all stationary batteries combined,” Rauscher added. “This is a massive resource.” And it’s only getting more massive: The Natural Resources Defense Council has estimated that if California V2G’ed all of the 14 million EVs it’s expected to have by 2035, they could power every home in the state for three days.

In these early days of the tech, though, only a handful of models sport V2G capabilities, but the number is growing. The hardware and software aren’t wildly complicated. A special charger juices up the vehicle’s battery, then draws from the car to power a house, in the case of vehicle-to-home systems, or sends it back to the utility, in the case of vehicle-to-grid.

Utilities will have to communicate with anyone participating in such a program, for instance with an app that allows a customer to, say, ask that their vehicle never be discharged below a certain percentage. Each utility will also need to figure out how much to compensate people for their power in order to incentivize them to join in. That might mean paying for the amount of energy provided, the same principle behind net metering, in which residential solar customers are reimbursed for the energy they give to the grid. “We’re still in a bit of an early stage here,” said Divesh Gupta, director of clean energy solutions at Baltimore Gas and Electric Company. “There are a lot of things that need to be worked out, particularly on the customer experience side.”

That battery power need not go all the way back to the grid, though, to help utilities. For years now, owners have been using their Ford Lightning trucks to power their homes. These batteries are mammoth — the extended-range version can go 300-plus miles — and powering a home with one uses just five or six miles of that range per hour.

So say an owner returns home at 6 pm, when demand on the grid is skyrocketing as everyone else is knocking off work and switching on air conditioners and other energy-hungry appliances. Because consumption is rising, so too is the price of electricity. But a Lightning owner doesn’t have to pay that if they’re using their battery to power their home for five hours until they go to bed, using 25 to 30 miles of range on their battery. “It basically makes the house disappear, effectively, from the grid,” said Ryan O’Gorman, Ford’s business lead for vehicle-to-grid and vehicle-to-home.

Then the owner can charge again when demand, and electricity prices, are lower. If they work from home, for example, they can charge during the day, when lots of solar power is coursing through the grid.

More homes tapping EV batteries also eases demand on the grid, which is especially welcome during a heat wave when everyone’s running their AC units. Those heat waves will only get worse from here — a growing challenge for utilities to provide the power that keeps people cool and safe. At the same time, ever more data centers are devouring ever more power and stressing the grid to its limits. That infrastructure also must accommodate other forms of decarbonization, like heat pumps and induction stoves, that are essential for weaning us off fossil fuels.

Instead of sitting idly in a garage depreciating, V2G turns an EV into an asset for bolstering the grid and powering the home cheaply. “Cars are parked more than 22 hours a day,” O’Gorman said. “When we look at the advantages of an EV, now that vehicle can provide savings and potentially revenue flows for the customer.” (Interestingly, even electric trains can now send juice back to the grid and generate revenue, thanks to what they gain from regenerative braking: In the Bay Area, the Caltrain system is now being compensated for that energy, slashing its estimated annual power cost from $19.5 million to $16.5 million.)

The residential V2G program in Baltimore follows other experiments across the nation with larger vehicles. In Oakland, California, for instance, the utility Pacific Gas and Electric worked with the electric bus provider Zum to deploy vehicles that take kids home in the afternoon, return to the lot, and plug back into the grid. Because their batteries are so large, they have ample power left over, sending that extra energy to the grid just as demand is spiking. They charge overnight, take kids to school, and plug in again to charge.

This kind of predictability could make commercial fleets even more powerful for V2G than residential vehicles, experts say. A school bus is on a schedule a utility can rely on — it’s parked and available at certain times of day, and making the rounds at others. Plus, in the summer, they would be available almost constantly. Other fleets, like delivery and government vehicles, follow regular timetables as well.

Fleet managers can also procure large numbers of the appropriate chargers, buying into the system en masse, compared to a homeowner shelling out for just one. “In the short term, we see commercial-level V2G applications as more viable due to infrastructure costs, but we expect affordable domestic units to emerge as the market matures and demand grows,” said a spokesperson for Nissan, which has long included bidirectional charging in its electric Leaf.

Utilities are still figuring out how to coordinate this ballet between vehicle, charger, and grid on a citywide scale. But the payoff could be big, because all those EVs are existing infrastructure that could help reduce the need to build dedicated battery plants to store renewable energy. The less a utility has to build, the fewer costs it has to pass on to ratepayers. And with more V2G, a utility that has to import lots of electricity from a neighboring state can now store power locally.

Thus this technology could reduce energy bills. And for participants, their vehicles now provide transportation and energy storage. “It would seem pretty easy to imagine that that’s going to be cheaper than building just stationary battery storage facilities that do nothing but support the grid in times of need,” said Rudi Halbright, product manager of VGI pilot implementation at Pacific Gas and Electric. “Because you’re not getting that secondary use with those batteries. They’re kind of sitting around a lot of the time.”

People are more complicated than battery banks, though. Folks with busy lives want the convenience of charging their cars whenever they like, and might not even realize how much prices fluctuate throughout the day, said David Victor, a professor at the University of California, San Diego, who studies the behavior of EV drivers. Many like the peace of mind of having a fully charged vehicle ready at all times. “I take from that that V2G is going to be really, really hard for fleets outside of professionally managed fleets,” Victor said, “that we know reliably are going to be available at the time that the V2G asset is going to be needed.”

Still, given the number of EVs out there, only a fraction of owners need to participate to make a sizable impact. And residential and commercial V2G can complement each other — and in turn, complement a utility’s larger battery facilities — a widescale diversification of energy storage that could accelerate the adoption of renewables. “I fundamentally believe that bidirectional electric vehicles are going to be something that no one’s ever heard of, until suddenly everyone has it,” Rauscher said. “Once we have enough customers enrolled and deployed out there, some percent of customers not plugging in and performing doesn’t really matter.”",https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/evs.jpg?quality=75&strip=all,N,,2025-10-17 07:58:12.014165

Exporters in Canada and Mexico have announced plans to add 2.5 billion ft3/d and 0.6 billion ft3/d of capacity over the same period, respectively. North American export capacity additions will total over 50% of expected global additions through 2029, according to the International Energy Agency.

USA

The planned liquefaction capacity additions will be concentrated around the US Gulf Coast, already the largest hub for LNG exports in the Atlantic Basin. To supply these terminals, new pipeline projects will be built to transport natural gas from production areas. However, pipeline construction delays remain a supply risk for new terminals. Plaquemines LNG Phase 1 shipped its first cargo in December 2024. Plaquemines LNG Phase 2 and Corpus Christi Stage III began shipping cargoes earlier in 2025, but they have not yet begun commercial operation. Five additional LNG export projects in the US have reached final investment decision (FID) and are currently under construction:

Port Arthur LNG Phase 1 (1.6 billion ft3/d).

Rio Grande LNG (2.1 billion ft3/d).

Woodside Louisiana LNG (2.2 billion ft3/d).

Golden Pass LNG (2.1 billion ft3/d).

CP2 Phase 1 (2.0 billion ft3/d).

Canada

On 1 July 2025, LNG Canada – the nation’s first LNG export terminal – shipped its first cargo from Train 1 after achieving first LNG production in late June. LNG Canada, located in British Columbia, can produce a combined 1.84 billion ft3/d from two liquefaction trains (0.9 billion ft3/d per train), and the facility is anticipated to reach full capacity in 2026. A proposed second phase of the project would double the export capacity to 3.68 billion ft3/d and expand the facility to four trains, according to the Canada Energy Regulator (CER). The expansion is expected to come online after 2029.

Canada’s new LNG capacity will be on the west coast of North America, reducing shipping times to Asian markets by 50% compared with exports from US Gulf Coast terminals, and will source feedgas from the Montney Formation in the western provinces of Alberta and British Columbia. Two other projects with a combined capacity of 0.7 billion ft3/d are currently under construction in Western Canada. Woodfibre LNG, with an export capacity of 0.3 billion ft3/d, is expected to start LNG exports in 2027. Cedar LNG – a floating LNG project with capacity to liquefy up to 0.4 billion ft3/d – reached FID in June 2024 and is expected to begin LNG exports in 2028.

Mexico

Developers are currently constructing two LNG export projects in Mexico with a combined capacity of 0.6 billion ft3/d – the Fast LNG Altamira floating LNG (FLNG) production vessel (FLNG2), which has a capacity to liquefy up to 0.2 billion ft3/d off the east coast of Mexico, and Energía Costa Azul (0.4 billion ft3/d export capacity) on Mexico's west coast.

Stellantis says the investments will expands its U.S. production footprint by 50 percent, with the program including five new vehicle Launches and 19 what it calls “product actions” that will add some 5,000 new jobs increase output at assembly plants in Illinois, Ohio, Michigan and Indiana.

Automotive assembly plants typically are served by numerous nearby component makers, including metals stamping and machining plants that produce significant flows of recyclable metal. The network of factories also generates steady streams of old corrugated containers (OCC) and plastic film scrap.

Stellantis calls the $13 billion program its largest single investment in the 100-year history of the company and its predecessor firms and brands, which include Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep and Ram.

The four plants directly benefiting from the program are assembly facilities in Belvidere, Illinois; Kokomo, Indiana; Warren, Michigan; and Toledo, Ohio.

“This investment in the U.S., the single largest in the company’s history, will drive our growth, strengthen our manufacturing footprint and bring more American jobs to the states we call home,” says Antonio Filosa, Stellantis CEO and North America chief operating officer.

“Accelerating growth in the U.S. has been a top priority since my first day,” says Filosa. “Success in America is not just good for Stellantis in the U.S.: it makes us stronger everywhere.”

When calculating the $13 billion investment price tag, Stellantis says it included research and development and supplier costs necessary to “execute the company’s full product strategy over the next four years,” as well as direct investments in its manufacturing operations.

The company provided the following breakdown of investments in the four locations.

In Illinois, Stellantis says it intends to invest more than $600 million to reopen the Belvidere Assembly Plant and expand production of the Jeep Cherokee and Jeep Compass for the U.S. market, with the plant’s relaunch expected in 2027 in a move anticipated to create around 3,300 new jobs.

The announcement about the Compass has not been well received in Canada, since production of that vehicle had been planned to take place in Brompton, Ontario.

According to AP News, the move has been noted by Canadian Prime Minister James Carney and Ontario Premier Doug Ford as tied to tariffs imposed by the administration of Donald J. Trump on goods manufactured in Canada.

AP quotes Canadian Industry Minister Mélanie Joly as saying the production shift violates existing agreements between Stellantis and government agencies in Canada. “Anything short of fulfilling that commitment will be considered as default under our agreements,"" Joly reportedly writes in a letter to Stellantis CEO Filosa.

In Ohio, an investment of nearly $400 million will result in the assembly of an all-new midsize truck (previously allocated to the Belvidere plant) at the Toledo Assembly Complex, where the new model will join the Jeep Wrangler and Jeep Gladiator as output. The production shift could create more than 900 jobs, with that launch expected in 2028.

In Michigan, Stellantis says it plans to develop an all-new range-extended electric vehicle (EV) and internal combustion engine large sport utility vehicle (SUV) that will be produced at the Warren Truck Assembly Plant beginning in 2028. The company says it will invest nearly $100 million to retool the facility and add more than 900 jobs there.

“This way, we’re getting more and more information out to people, especially about this really important topic of battery safety,” she said.","Energy storage experts from organizations such as the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and the New York State Office of Fire Prevention and Control gathered Thursday at Binghamton University to discuss the future of American-based battery innovation and safety.

Today, batteries power some of the most important aspects of our lives — from mobile phones and laptops to medical devices. As progress continues to be made in adopting clean technology, battery safety and reliability is a major priority.

The Battery Safety Symposium, held as part of Battery Week events organized by New Energy New York, brought together industry leaders to highlight developments in the sector, discuss potential challenges and solutions, and raise awareness of the best practices when it comes to operating batteries. Around 100 people registered for the symposium.

“It’s exciting to be a leader in not just the manufacturing and development of lithium batteries, but also to be a leader in helping people understand how they work and how to maintain them safely,” Binghamton University President Harvey Stenger said. “Today’s focus is on fire safety, related to batteries for large storage systems, and we have some of the world’s experts talking to a large group of people who want to understand what the safety issues we have to worry about for lithium batteries are, and how we manage them.”

Three Binghamton-led initiatives — New Energy New York, the NENY Tech Hub and the NSF Energy Storage Engine in Upstate New York — work together across multiple sectors to bolster U.S. leadership and competitiveness in energy storage.

“When you think about cars, you think of Detroit. We want that in the future,” said Ziang “John” Zhang, associate professor of electrical and computer engineering and workshop organizer. “When people think about batteries, they think of Binghamton and upstate New York’s ecosystem. That’s our goal.”

Attendees on Thursday learned about ways in which New York’s fire department is updating its fire safety codes in response to the increasing deployment of batteries. They also heard statistics on battery-related emergencies and how to prevent them.

“Dealing with battery emergencies in the fire service has been a passion of mine now for a couple years, and a lot of it has to do with the fact that I realized a lot of the firefighters across New York state didn’t have any knowledge on what to do with this,” said Victor Graves, a fire protection specialist with the NYS Office of Fire Prevention and Control. “The goal with this [workshop] is to make sure that they have the knowledge and they don’t get hurt.”

The workshop also brought in companies such as Viridi and Intertek, which are working to strengthen grid resiliency and test new technology to ensure safety, respectively. Speakers also detailed energy-storage related projects, including the MTA’s initiative to bring electric, zero-emission buses to New York City.

As a joint effort of the S3IP Center of Excellence, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Binghamton University’s Electrical and Computer Engineering Department and New Energy New York, the symposium was open not just to engineers and academics, but also to anyone who was interested in learning more about the industry, including students.

Binghamton senior Ashley Reed is a member of the student-run Binghamton Venture Fund, which offers real-world practice when it comes to investing in early-stage, private companies. She said she attended the safety symposium in order to better understand the energy storage industry at large, as well as potential opportunities within it.

“If there’s a strong need for battery storage, or the safety systems beyond it, that’s something we might look more into,” she said. “Just becoming more enlightened about the industry itself was interesting, because I’ve always heard about some of these problems just from the news — but being able to hear firsthand from the fire department and getting additional insights was all very interesting.”

The day also included live demonstrations of Viridi’s new energy storage system, as well as the opportunity to view a student-made electric racing car by Binghamton Motorsports. Attendees could also explore different modes of manufacturing through the SUNY Schenectady Mobile Learning Lab.

Indranil Bhattacharya, chair of Binghamton University’s Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, closed the day by highlighting faculty research in clean energy and opportunities for potential collaborations.

As Binghamton University remains a nexus between academia and industry to boost battery production in upstate New York, S3IP Project Staff Associate Caroline Pasquale said including safety in the discussion is critical.

“It’s very important that we continue to talk about it, especially with the initiatives that we have going on with NENY, the Tech Hub and the NSF Energy Storage Engine. They all blend together, and everybody’s working toward the same goal of battery manufacturing here in New York state,” she said. “Along with that, a huge component of that is battery safety.”

As school districts, fire stations and transportation authorities adopt clean energy storage, Pasquale hopes to keep offering opportunities for stakeholders from all corners of industry to get together and raise awareness on how to do it correctly and responsibly.

“This way, we’re getting more and more information out to people, especially about this really important topic of battery safety,” she said. “It’s only going to keep getting bigger.”",https://www.binghamton.edu/news/images/uploads/features/_normal/NENY_Battery-Week-Day-4_ZS20251016_JPEG-7.jpg,N,,2025-10-17 07:58:21.306792

Electric vehicle sales just hit an all-time high in the U.S. — but don’t expect the boom to last long.

For every 10 cars that automakers sold from July through September, one was an EV, according to fresh data from Cox Automotive. In other words, nearly 440,000 new battery-powered vehicles hit the nation’s roads during the third quarter of 2025. The previous single-quarter record, set in the final three months of last year, isn’t even in the same ballpark.

But the sales surge has a catch. Buyers flocked to EVs last quarter because it was their final opportunity to take advantage of a $7,500 federal tax credit that disappeared at the end of September under President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act. The incentive was previously slated to last until 2033.

Under these conditions, ​“the all-time sales and share records in Q3 were all but certain,” Cox wrote in a blog post accompanying the data. This quarter, by contrast, the company expects EV sales to ​“drop notably.”

Still, the U.S. electric vehicle market isn’t dead in the water without the tax credit. Already, automakers that have invested huge sums in the EV transition are making changes to try and keep sales going in America. Hyundai, for example, announced in early October that it will cut the price of its popular Ioniq 5 EV by nearly $10,000 next year. One week later, General Motors unveiled a $29,000 version of its Chevy Bolt.

Some state and local governments are taking action, too: Colorado boosted the discounts it offers for both new and used EVs. Burlington, Vermont, launched a similar program.

Meanwhile, the country’s public EV charging network is growing steadily, and the Trump administration is moving ahead with a $5 billion Biden-era program to build out charging infrastructure.

It’s clear, as Cox points out, that electrified vehicles are the future of transportation. Indeed, some countries are already living in that era: In Norway, more than eight in 10 new cars sold are fully electric. The roadblocks set up by the Trump administration might delay progress in the U.S., but it can’t stave off the inevitable.",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/COTW-ev-boom.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=80&w=1200&s=4a78508e8513a6e17a2e7f1dc2ac623f,N,,2025-10-17 09:00:33.730187

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Department of Energy said Thursday it has finalized a $1.6 billion loan guarantee to a subsidiary of one of the nation’s largest power companies to upgrade nearly 5,000 miles of transmission lines across five states, mostly in the Midwest, for largely fossil fuel-run energy.

AEP Transmission will upgrade power lines in Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Oklahoma and West Virginia to enhance enhance grid reliability and capacity, the Energy Department said. The project is meant to help meet surging electricity demand from data centers and artificial intelligence.

Ohio-based American Electric Power, which owns AEP Transmission, is one of the nation’s largest utilities, serving 5.6 million customers in 11 states. It primarily produces electricity from coal, natural gas and nuclear power, along with renewable resources such as wind and hydroelectric power.

Thursday’s announcement deepens the Trump administration’s commitment to traditional, polluting energy sources even as it works to discourage the U.S. from clean energy use.

Earlier this month, the administration cancelled $7.6 billion in grants that supported hundreds of clean energy projects in 16 states, all of which voted for Democrat Kamala Harris in last year’s presidential election. A total of 223 projects were terminated after a review determined they did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs or were not economically viable, the Energy Department said.

The cancellations include up to $1.2 billion for California’s hydrogen hub aimed at developing clean-burning hydrogen fuels to power ships and heavy-duty trucks. A hydrogen project costing up to $1 billion in the Pacific Northwest also was cancelled.

The loan guarantee finalized Thursday is the first offered by the Trump administration under the recently renamed Energy Dominance Financing program created by the massive tax-and-spending law approved this summer by congressional Republicans and signed by President Donald Trump. Electric utilities that receive loans through the program must provide assurances to the government that financial benefits from the financing will be passed on to customers, the Energy Department said.

The project and others being considered will help ensure that Americans “will have access to affordable, reliable and secure energy for decades to come,” Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in a statement.

“The president has been clear: America must reverse course from the energy subtraction agenda of past administrations and strengthen our electrical grid,” Wright said, adding that modernizing the grid and expanding transmission capacity “will help position the United States to win the AI race and grow our manufacturing base.”

The upgrades supported by the federal financing will replace existing transmission lines in existing rights-of-way with new lines capable of carrying more energy, the power company said.

More than 2,000 miles of transmission lines in Ohio serving 1.5 million people will be replaced, along with more than 1,400 miles in Indiana and Michigan serving 600,000 customers, the company said. An additional 1,400 miles in Oklahoma, serving about 1.2 million people and 26 miles in West Virginia, serving 460,000 people, will be replaced.

The projects will create about 1,100 construction jobs, the company said.

The loan guarantee will save customers money and improve reliability while supporting economic growth in the five states, said Bill Fehrman, AEP’s chairman, president and chief executive officer. “The funds we will save through this program enable us to make additional investments to enhance service for our customers,” he added.

Wright, in a conference call with reporters, distinguished the AEP loan guarantee from a $4.9 billion federal loan guarantee the department cancelled in July. That money would have boosted the planned Grain Belt Express, a new high-voltage transmission line set to deliver solar and wind-generated electricity from the Midwest to eastern states.

The Energy Department said at the time it was “not critical for the federal government to have a role” in the first phase of the $11 billion project planned by Chicago-based Invenergy. The department also questioned whether the project could meet strict financial conditions required, a claim Wright repeated Thursday.

“Ultimately that is a commercial enterprise that needs private developers,” Wright said. The company has indicated the Grain Belt project will go forward.

Trump and Wright have repeatedly derided wind and solar energy as unreliable and opposed efforts to combat climate change by moving away from fossil fuels. Wright said the Grain Belt Express loan was among billions of dollars worth of commitments “rushed out the doors” in the waning days of former President Joe Biden’s administration.",https://www.thenewsherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Trump_Argentina_40595.jpg?w=1024&h=682,N,,2025-10-17 14:11:20.278383

The lawsuit, filed Thursday in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington, accuses the Environmental Protection Agency of breaching grant agreements by unilaterally terminated grants that had already been awarded.

""The administration is again targeting people struggling to get by in America, this time by gutting programs that help low-income households afford electricity, Washington State Attorney General Nick Brown said in a statement.

""Congress passed a solar energy program to help make electricity costs more affordable, but the administration is ignoring the law and focused on the conspiracy theory that climate change is a hoax.

The Solar for All program was established with the passage of the Biden administration's Inflation Reduction Act in 2022, which included a $27 billion Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund for the EPA to administer.

Using that Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, Congress appropriated $7 billion for the EPA to make grants, loans and financial assistance available for low-income and disadvantaged communities to benefit from zero-emission technologies, including solar power.

In April 2024, the EPA announced it had selected 60 applicants to receive the grants. By August of that year, the EPA had awarded program funds to states and other grant recipients.

But in August, the EPA, under the Trump administration, ended the program and reclaimed about 90% of the funds already awarded.

The 22 states, along with the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation, are accusing the Trump administration of violating the Administrative Procedure Act, which governs how administrative agencies operate, and the Constitution's separation of powers doctrine by canceling the program.

The plaintiffs allege that the EPA is using an ""erroneous interpretation"" of H.R. 1, which the Trump administration calls the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, passed by Congress in July, to justify the termination of the grants.

Last week, a judge from Louisiana’s 38th Judicial District Court effectively halted construction of Commonwealth LNG by ordering state regulators to analyze the facility's climate change and environmental justice-related impacts, in conjunction with the broader LNG buildout in southwest Louisiana's Cameron Parish.

Earlier this year, Trump reversed a Biden-era pause on exports of liquefied natural gas, or LNG, as part of his goal to boost natural gas exports and promote “energy dominance.”

Last year, the Biden administration's Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm’s had warned that “unfettered exports” of liquefied natural gas would increase planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions — a statement reflecting the findings of a Department of Energy report released in December.

Trump-appointed Energy Secretary Chris Wright, a fossil fuel executive, has moved to fast-track the buildout of LNG facilities, including Commonwealth LNG, which received an export authorization within weeks of Trump's inauguration.

“Cameron Parish is ground zero for the relentless expansion of the gas export industry,” said Anne Rolfes, founder of the Louisiana Bucket Brigade, an environmental group involved in the litigation. “We’re going to stop it and this is an important step in that process.”

Lyle Hanna, a Commonwealth LNG spokesperson, said that “we are disappointed with the District Court’s decision, and we are exploring all available legal options.”

A spokesperson for the Louisiana Department of Conservation and Energy declined to comment, citing the potential of pending litigation. Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill said that the state planned to appeal.

“Sadly even state court judges are not immune from climate activism,” Murrill said.

Last year, a federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., had ordered the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to reassess Commonwealth LNG's air pollution, including its greenhouse gas emissions. In June, the commission gave the project a greenlight on the grounds that its construction was in the public interest.

In regulatory filings, the Louisiana Department of Conservation and Energy said that “climate change is currently beyond the scope"" of the state's regulatory review.

But District Judge Penelope Richard rejected this position, saying state environmental regulators have a duty to consider how the LNG facility, along with others clustered nearby, would impact extreme weather events, storm severity and sea-level rise in a state where a football field-worth of land disappears every 100 minutes.

Richard also ordered state regulators to analyze the facility's impacts on local communities, especially those living in poverty or relying on fishing for their livelihoods — which she noted was the “defining characteristic” of the parish. While the facility could destroy marshes, harm water quality and displace residents, the judge wrote, “none of it was considered in terms of impacts on environmental justice communities.""

Commercial fisherman Eddie LeJuine, a lifelong Cameron Parish resident, applauded the ruling. He said the buildout of LNG infrastructure, including dredging for shipping channels, has significantly harmed the fishing industry.

“The fishermen are barely hanging on with a thread,” LeJuine said. ""These plants are killing the estuary and killing our livelihoods. We’re getting extinct.”

In August, a dredging channel being developed by LNG firm Venture Global leaked into a nearby estuary. Local fishermen like LeJuine say the onslaught of saltwater and sediment will kill off large amounts of oyster, crab and fish.

Venture Global, which is in the process of constructing a second LNG export terminal in the parish, said it is “committed to conservation"" and is working with state regulators and the community to respond to the incident.

The Village of Germantown Plan Commission on Monday voted against a proposal from Seattle-based OneEnergy Development for a solar energy facility at N144 W12531 Pioneer Road. The developer sought a conditional use permit, which will go to the Village Board on Nov. 3 with an unfavorable mark from the commission.

The proposed facility will have solar modules and collection equipment that will deliver power to the grid serving local We Energies customers, plans showed. The facility will have capacity of six megawatts, capable of serving 1,400 households. The project calls for solar modules mounted on single-axis racking, around 24 inverters to convert electricity for distribution, and transformers.

Robert Overmier owns the land and is working with OneEnergy to create the solar field, located on a larger 57-acre parcel. The property is currently farmland.

However, their proposal met opposition from at least a dozen residents, TMJ4 reported. Some said they were against the loss of farmland and others said they didn’t like how the proposed site looked.

Dubbed “Lime Kiln Solar,” the project will have a lifespan of 30-50 years and will use around 30 union workers at the height of construction, project plans showed.

“Our approach to solar development, engineering, and construction is low-impact and dual use,” OneEnergy officials wrote.

Officials said the area beneath and around the panels will be planted with a perennial pollinator mix to improve runoff and erosion control and enhance soil fertility over the lifetime of the project. The field will also have 8-foot fences to exclude deer, like ones used around an orchard. The area around the project will continue to be farmed, they added.

If the project gets final approval, construction is expected to take four to six months and will be completed in 2026 or 2027, depending on permitting and approvals.

Marsh will participate in the panel “Cracking Down on China — Addressing Risks to American Energy and Supply Chain Security”. The discussion will explore policy and investment strategies that safeguard U.S. manufacturing, reward clean production, and support fair competition in global markets. By combining innovation with strong domestic investment, Plug is proving that the U.S. can compete head-to-head with China, not through subsidies, but through productivity, reliability, and clean-energy excellence.

Marsh, said:

America’s energy advantage is its competitive edge,

“By turning that power into hydrogen and liquid fuels here at home, we can out-innovate global competitors, secure supply chains, and build a stronger, cleaner economy. I want to thank Senator Cassidy for his leadership in advancing policies that protect U.S. manufacturers and reward environmental accountability.”

Plug has identified Louisiana as a strategic hub for its expanding hydrogen network. Earlier this year, Plug and Olin Corporation launched Hidrogenii, a 15-ton-per-day liquid hydrogen joint venture in St. Gabriel, one of the Gulf Coast’s first large-scale hydrogen plants. The facility anchors Plug’s vertically integrated hydrogen ecosystem, serving industrial and mobility customers across the Southeast and Gulf regions.

Marsh’s participation underscores Plug’s leadership in building a resilient U.S. hydrogen economy, driving domestic manufacturing, and supporting smart policy measures, such as Senator Cassidy’s Foreign Pollution Fee Act, that create a level playing field for clean, efficient American producers.

General FAQs

Do I need permit coverage?

It is the responsibility of the operator to determine if permit coverage is required. Operators are required to obtain NPDES coverage if stormwater from the activity has the potential to enter a surface water of the state or a municipal separate storm sewer system (MS4).

Most sites have the potential to discharge stormwater. Even sites with stormwater treatment may discharge stormwater offsite. Many stormwater systems are designed to retain a specific quantity of stormwater based on rain events and local conditions, and to discharge any stormwater received over the design capacity. If the system discharges or overflows offsite, that is considered a discharge to an MS4 or water of the state.

Can I transfer permit coverage to a new operator when a facility/site changes hands?

NPDES stormwater permits are nontransferable. Coverage is given to the operator who conducts regulated activities. The responsible authority is liable for all activities indicated on the NOI.

If the operator of a site changes, due to ownership or contractor changes, etc., the new operator is responsible for submitting a Notice of Intent with processing fee to obtain permit coverage. The prior operator is responsible for submitting a Notice of Termination.

Applying for Coverage

How do I obtain permit coverage?

The operator must submit a Notice of Intent and processing fee for the NPDES Stormwater Generic Permit.

NOIs cannot be processed via email, as they do not meet federal CROMERR signatory requirements.

NOIs can be submitted through the Business Portal with PIN Guidance and CGP Guidance or MSGP Guidance. If NOIs cannot be submitted through the Business Portal, they must be mailed or faxed. Mail the NOI and processing fee to:

Florida Department of Environmental Protection

PO Box 3070

Tallahassee, FL 32315

Applications cannot be processed without payment. If an NOI is submitted without the processing fee, the department will send an invoice. Invoices can be paid online through the Business Portal. An application is considered incomplete if the fee has not been received or if the NOI is missing information. An incomplete NOI must be corrected to be considered complete. In this case, you will receive a Requests for Additional Information (RAI) via email.

How do I pay the processing fee?

If you are submitting a paper NOI, a check or money order should be made payable to the Florida Department of Environmental Protection. You may also submit a paper NOI and pay online through the DEP Business Portal once application has been processed and you receive a facility ID number. Visa or MasterCard are accepted.

** Note: other state of Florida agencies may pay through a Journal Transfer. **

When is my permit coverage effective?

Permit coverage for construction and industrial activities is effective two days after date DEP receives your complete NOI and processing fee.

Note: the acknowledgement may be sent after the effective date of coverage.

How do I renew coverage for my NPDES Stormwater GP?

Coverage under an NPDES Stormwater GP is effective for a period of five years. To renew coverage, the facility must ensure the Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP) has been updated to reflect conditions currently occurring at the facility and submit a new Notice of Intent and processing fee.

Filling out the NOI

Who can submit the NOI?

The operator of the regulated activity is responsible for submitting an NOI and maintaining compliance with the permit. The NOI must be signed by the responsible authority.

The “operator” is the entity (business, company, etc.) that operates the activity/project and has sufficient authority to ensure compliance with the permit. Typically, the operator is the developer or construction general contractor. Generally, the architect/engineer or project manager should not be indicated as the operator unless they have operational control over the project and are willing to accept responsibility for compliance with the CGP.

The “responsible authority” is the person who has authority to sign the NOI for the operator (Rule 62-620.305, F.A.C.), specifies who may sign permit applications. The person who signs the NOI assumes responsibility for permit compliance. For instance, the operator may be “The John Smith Development Company” and the responsible authority may be “John Smith, President.” In this case, John Smith would sign the NOI for the John Smith Development Company.

A site owner can choose to hold the permit should the owner decide to assume responsibility for ensuring that the operator is adhering conditions of the permit and the Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP) on site.

Note: A registered agent does not meet the definition of “Responsible Authority.”

In the Business Portal, a preparer can fill out the NOI, but the NOI must be signed by the Responsible Authority.

What is my Operator Status?

P = Private

M = Public (other than federal or state)

S = State

F = Federal

What do I enter for “MS4 Operator Name” and “Receiving Water Name”?

If stormwater discharges to an MS4, indicate the name of the municipality, county or other public body that operates the MS4. For instance, Orange County MS4, Tampa MS4, FDOT District-4 MS4, etc. Note: the Business Portal lists those MS4s that are permitted by DEP; however, your site may discharge to another MS4.

If stormwater does not discharge to an MS4, but rather discharges to surface waters of the state, indicate the route and name of the first named waterbody that receives the discharge. For instance, unnamed ditch to Catfish Creek, Redfish Bay, Gar Slough, unnamed canal to Sunfish Pond, etc.

Map with nearby water bodies.

Checking my NOI Status

I sent my NOI several weeks ago, but have not heard anything back. Will I receive a reply?

Our goal is to process NOIs received via mail within two weeks. The Responsible Authority will receive an automated email once we begin processing the NOI. Once reviewed, permitting staff will send you a request for additional information or acknowledgement of coverage.

Generally, if the check has been deposited and not returned, we have received your application.

The big picture: The states argue in a lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington Thursday that the EPA ""illegally terminated"" the program that's ""designed to bring low-cost distributed solar energy to over 900,000 households in low-income and disadvantaged communities.""

A spokesperson for the EPA declined to comment in a Thursday night email that noted it does not comment on pending litigation.

State of play: Congress appropriated funds for the Solar for All program during President Biden's administration in 2022 through the Inflation Reduction Act.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin in an August YouTube video called the program a ""boondoggle"" and a ""grift"" as he announced its cancellation.

Shifting rules on the clean energy credits in sections 45X and 45Z are far more straightforward for companies to incorporate.
Read more: IRS Notice sheds light on construction rules for wind and solar credits Navigating the energy credit landscape after H.R.","Keeping pace with energy trends is more challenging than ever before. Companies and investment firms have found themselves recalibrating strategies and expectations based on new generation and storage technologies, significant changes in (often clashing) federal and state tax incentives and shifting overseas regulations and market trends. Driving both investment and the national energy conversation: power demand that is surging everywhere.

The energy investment landscape has been correspondingly unpredictable; the Trump administration has implemented policies discouraging investments in the fast-growing renewables industry, creating uncertainty by moving to eliminate clean energy tax credits, cancel wind and solar projects and reignite the coal industry. But the rapid growth in energy demand, from rising electrification as well as data centers, has entered the equation to keep the focus on renewables. As a result, investors are still bullish on renewables and optimism in private equity continues to climb.

Our panel on trends in energy investments discussed how the recent pullback on incentives for renewables has changed some calculations: Many investments originally made to take advantage of credits are going away. However, companies are proceeding with economically viable projects. With a huge amount of battery capacity set to come online, panelists predicted a cycle of M&A emerging for physical energy assets as well as continued growth in the tax credit market.

Solar projects look to dominate new energy capacity, though the momentum is beginning to decelerate after years of explosive growth. Investment in storage and gas is accelerating dramatically, while wind growth is slowing.

Among the themes this panel covered:

Perhaps counterintuitively, oil production increased during the Obama and Biden administrations. Part of the explanation: States have tended to create demand catalysts in response to federal incentives and regulations.

Fast-rising energy demand may weaken the current administration’s resistance to solar power. Don’t be surprised if federal policies and incentives shift as needs increase.

There’s a gap between conversation and generation, most notably with regard to nuclear power. There is a lot of discussion around this energy source, but its near-term impact on the national power supply will likely remain minor.

Many developers and investors are struggling to assess the evolving market for transferable clean energy credits, direct pay and new financing vehicles. The energy market has seen dramatic shifts over the past three years, as companies and investors deal with the ramifications of, first, the Inflation Reduction Act and, now, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Beyond the prediction that energy demand will continue growing rapidly, figuring out where the development market is going requires some soothsaying.

Our panel saw the market fully stratified by risk, with investors looking for backstops on companies’ balance sheets and new, sophisticated financing tools coming into play. An active tax credit investment market will be key, and analysts expect private capital to take an ever-larger role in projects.

Among the topics this panel covered:

Investment firms are struggling to gauge the tax credit market in the short and long term. The demand for tax credits has diminished since 2024, given favorable domestic tax changes decreasing appetite. But supply remains high and the market remains robust.

Recent Treasury guidance gave renewables developers until July 2026 to qualify for certain federal tax incentives, presenting a tight deadline for the end of the 5% safe harbor rule for wind and utility-scale solar energy projects. Developers need to develop a robust safe harbor strategy.

Robust FEOC (foreign entities of concern) rules may seriously affect the availability of battery and solar capacity, with major impacts on both development plans and investment and tax credits.

Sustainability News Brief

An unusual number of federal-level developments look to have an outsized impact on company leaders trying to anticipate the administration’s next move and stay ahead of potential problems. Our panel took a candid look at the legislative and regulatory landscape affecting the energy industry, focusing on shifting energy incentives and tariffs that may impact the costs and timelines of energy project development.

Tariffs are on everyone’s mind, particularly those affecting products at the heart of energy industry infrastructure, from solar panels to steel and aluminum. As panelists noted, no one is completely clear on the long-term impacts of the administration’s tariff strategy on prices, supply chains or anything else. Companies, many currently working to renegotiate the price of critical materials such as copper, will need to watch developments carefully.

The panel also discussed:

There is tension between the administration’s approach to solar and wind power and some Republican senators’ support for renewable energy that benefits their states. The US Treasury Department has had to strike a balance in developing guidance.

Legislation and regulation are increasingly incorporating complex FEOC rules, but some Republican senators are concerned that strict implementation would hold back development of even conventional energy infrastructure.

Corporate leaders should be open-minded about the changing tax policy landscape and about which legislators or policymakers might be willing to listen to concerns and work to change rules.

How to quantify sustainability factors in dealmaking | PwC Global

Translating the tax bill for business: How should executives prepare?

News headlines suggest that companies are scaling back their sustainability initiatives. A deeper look at available data suggests a slightly different story. PwC’s Second Annual State of Decarbonization Report shows that 37% of companies are increasing their climate ambitions while only 16% are getting less aggressive. What’s behind this? Demand for power is only rising, and the need to tap solar, wind and other low carbon sources is becoming a business imperative, particularly with climate-related volatility threatening business continuity and resilience.

But leaders face supply chain challenges, not least in building the infrastructure that makes clean energy use possible. New federal FEOC rules are prompting companies to increase scrutiny of their supply chains and enhance related data collection efforts. Financing renewable energy deals can involve a daunting number of stakeholders and, with tax credits at stake, it’s important to get the documentation right and socialize it with other parties, to prove vendors’ eligibility if necessary. The volume of required information and the tracking of that data for due diligence should only continue to grow, as other supply chain partners also strive for compliance.

Collecting, monitoring and analyzing data of sufficient granularity can be onerous. Our panelists suggested looking to the enormous amount of publicly available data on suppliers and business operations and leveraging AI-based capabilities to pull together information in useful form.

Our panel also discussed:

Circularity is increasingly important in some industries looking for a systemic approach that minimizes waste and maximizes resource efficiency. Companies that have figured out circularity are measurably reducing waste, recovering rare earth minerals and seeing significant cost benefits.

Given the new FEOC rules, companies will need to determine their material assistance cost ratio, or a project’s direct costs that come from inputs provided by a foreign entity. A manufacturer, for example, will need to bring together the tax function, legislative affairs and operations among other departments to compile the relevant data from vendors and suppliers.

Why companies should start to reconsider the business case for circularity

Navigating the energy credit landscape after H.R. 1

In the wake of the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), many corporate leaders paused major decisions on energy deals to sort through the ramifications of new compliance issues and dramatically shifted tax incentives. Some businesses have moved to reduce exposure to renewables, responding to shareholder calls to focus on core competencies. The landscape for tax credits was particularly hazy, and only now is clarity emerging.

Our panelists discussed the state of the tax credits market, including new financing vehicles and the impact on M&A in upcoming months. OBBBA and IRS Notice 2025-42, which eliminated the 5% safe harbor for most wind and solar facilities, have introduced new considerations around credits and have driven a reassessment of the state of renewable energy in the United States.

Analysts expect a round of energy deals in the next year, with more involving solar and storage and dramatically fewer involving wind. De-risked projects may have little trouble finding financing, but every contract will need provisions about diligence and material assistance, and companies don’t necessarily have those systems in place. Sellers will have the added burden of compliance with new FEOC rules, requiring close monitoring of supply chains in 2026 and beyond.

Among the topics this panel covered:

On FEOC, leaders are looking for further Treasury guidance as the tax credit marketplace becomes more competitive. Analysts expect guidance in the next month or two, in the form of a notice, months ahead of an official regulation. Shifting rules on the clean energy credits in sections 45X and 45Z are far more straightforward for companies to incorporate.

Surprisingly often, companies have little visibility into who owns their debt. With FEOC compliance rules, many are asking their lenders for attestation that they’re not foreign entities, which those lenders may be unprepared to provide. Organizations may currently lack the tax expertise — or the data — to confidently claim full compliance.

Some companies’ positive experience with tax credits is leading to an uptick in leaders expressing interest. Demand is increasing for safe, investment-grade insurance-backed credits. But the supply of those safe credits is limited, and at some point the financial margin could be too narrow to be worth the bureaucratic effort.

Data shows PHEVs emit just 19% less CO2 than petrol and diesel cars, an analysis by the non-profit advocacy group Transport and Environment found on Thursday.

“Real-world emissions are going up, while official emissions are going down,” said Sofía Navas Gohlke, a researcher at Transport and Environment and the co-author of the report.
Even when the cars were driven in electric mode, the analysis found that levels of pollution were well above official estimates.","Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) pump out nearly five times more planet-heating pollution than official figures show, a report has found.

The cars, which can run on electric batteries as well as combustion engines, have been promoted by European carmakers as a way to cover long distances in a single drive – unlike fully electric cars – while still reducing emissions.

Data shows PHEVs emit just 19% less CO2 than petrol and diesel cars, an analysis by the non-profit advocacy group Transport and Environment found on Thursday. Under laboratory tests, they were assumed to be 75% less polluting.

The researchers analysed data from the onboard fuel consumption meters of 800,000 cars registered in Europe between 2021 and 2023. They found real-world carbon dioxide emissions from PHEVs in 2023 were 4.9 times greater than those from standardised laboratory tests, having risen from being 3.5 times greater in 2021.

“Real-world emissions are going up, while official emissions are going down,” said Sofía Navas Gohlke, a researcher at Transport and Environment and the co-author of the report. “This is the gap that is getting worse and it is a real problem. As a result, PHEVs pollute almost as much as petrol cars.”

The researchers attributed most of the gap to overestimates of the “utility factor” – the ratio of miles travelled in electric mode to the total miles travelled – finding that 27% of driving was done in electric mode even though official estimates assumed 84%. The European Commission has announced two corrections to the utility factor ratio that will narrow the gap but not close it entirely, according to the analysis.

Even when the cars were driven in electric mode, the analysis found that levels of pollution were well above official estimates. The researchers said this was because electric motors were not strong enough to operate alone, with their engines burning fossil fuels for almost one-third of the distance travelled in electric mode.

Patrick Plötz, head of energy economics at the Fraunhofer Institute for Systems and Innovation Research, who was not involved in the study, said it was a “very useful contribution” after years in which parts of the automotive industry argued there was too little data to accurately assess real-world emissions.

“The results demonstrate, beyond any doubt, that the gap between official and real-world PHEV fuel consumption and CO2 emissions is much, much larger than for gasoline or diesel cars,” said Plötz, who has published research on the topic. “Any policy changes with respect to PHEVs should be made with utmost care and in the light of that data.”

Hybrid cars have been drawn back into the political debate as carmakers have pressed the EU to weaken CO2 targets. A ban on new combustion engine cars in 2035 has been subject to heavy lobbying from the automotive industry and opposition from member states with large car industries.

“There must not be a drastic cut in 2035,” the German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, said after a summit last week with the country’s struggling automobile industry, promising to do “everything in [his] power” to achieve that. Other senior German politicians have floated plug-in hybrids as one example of possible “flexibilities” they could introduce to the legislation.

The researchers calculated that the underestimate of PHEV emissions had let four major carmaker groups avoid more than €5bn (£4.3bn) in fines between 2021 and 2023, by making it artificially easier to comply with the EU’s fleet-average CO2 targets. They added that drivers of PHEVs would also be paying about €500 more a year in running costs than would be assumed under laboratory tests.

“The bold claims that manufacturers like to make about their plug-in hybrid vehicles are clearly way off the mark,” said Colin Walker, a transport analyst at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e2c2db07dea96b8ac0349b221f3ecebb2c8543d5/582_0_4800_3840/master/4800.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=79b5d0c09db3a4b6415c8f190ba0469a",N,,2025-10-17 00:02:30.693280

NEW YORK, Oct. 16, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- In an era dominated by digital and social media marketing, new research released today by Clarify Group shows that the in-person, immersive experience of attending an Auto Show in the United States and Canada continues to play a critical role in the new-vehicle purchase journey for consumers — and has a measurable impact on consumer buying decisions.

Clarify Group Inc., a leading automotive research and insights firm, conducts research on behalf of the three largest Auto Shows in North America: the Los Angeles Auto Show, the Canadian International AutoShow (Toronto) and the New York International Auto Show. As the new Auto Show season approaches — with Los Angeles opening Nov. 21, Toronto on Feb. 13, 2026, and New York on April 3, 2026 — Clarify is releasing highlights from the most recent studies conducted across the three shows, representing the voices of nearly 9,000 visitors.

These findings offer important insights for vehicle manufacturers, marketers and retailers about consumer intent and behavior. The research underscores the importance of Auto Show participation for OEMs and the risks created for any brands that choose not to participate.

Key Findings (across all three shows unless otherwise stated)

40% of Auto Show visitors intend to buy or lease a new vehicle within the next 12 months

Auto Show visitors are 2.9 times more likely than the average consumer to purchase or lease a new vehicle within the next year

68% of Auto Show visitors are in the market to buy within 24 months

Gen Z visitors are the most enthusiastic promoters among all age groups—they are 1.5 times more likely than average to recommend the Auto Show to friends and family, challenging the perception that Gen Z consumers prefer only digital engagement with brands

Key Reasons for Attending

80% attend to see new models and brands*

37% attend to help decide on a new-vehicle purchase or lease

21% attend to learn more about electric vehicles*

Overall, 84% of visitors said the shows were helpful in making their next new-vehicle decision.*

Impact on Consumer Behavior

After attending the Auto Show, visitors who intend to acquire a new vehicle within the next 12 months engaged in behaviors that OEMs and Dealers care about including:*

58% went online to learn more about a model

55% visited a dealership to inquire about a vehicle

39% arranged a test drive

28% purchased or placed an order for a new vehicle

When visitors were asked what impact, if any, the absence of specific brands at the Auto Show had on their future plans:**

23% said they were likely to consider a different brand after attending

20% said they were less likely to consider a brand that was absent from the show

** New York and Los Angeles auto shows

Industry Perspectives

""We have partnered with Clarify for the last three years. We consider this consumer research mission-critical for understanding our visitors and ensuring the best return on investment for our exhibitors each year,"" said Jason Campbell, general manager of the Canadian International AutoShow.

""We believe in the adage: if you can't measure it, you can't manage it. This research clearly illustrates the value of Auto Shows — for brands, dealers and consumers alike,"" said Mark Schienberg, president of the Greater New York Automobile Dealers Association. ""Fully half of in-market visitors add at least one new brand to their consideration list as a result of attending—but only those brands who make the commitment to be at the show benefit from this incremental consideration"".

""Auto shows continue to play a vital role in the car-buying journey,"" said Terri Toennies, president of the Los Angeles Auto Show. ""The visitor survey data confirms that we help consumers make more confident, informed purchase decisions"".

""These results challenge the outdated notion that consumers have lost interest in in-person automotive experiences"", said Darren Slind, co-founder and president of Clarify. ""The evidence is clear and consistent across the three largest auto shows in North America that they remain a vital part of the path-to-purchase journey for consumers and offer a high-impact platform for manufacturers to grow brand engagement and consideration"".

Natural Resources and Environmental Protection

This post begins by providing an overview of total spending for the departments overseen by the California Natural Resources Agency (CNRA) and California Environmental Protection Agency (CalEPA). Next, we discuss a number of cross-cutting issues that affect departments in both agencies, including Proposition 4, budget reductions, and spending from the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund (GGRF). We then discuss individual departments that had notable budget changes within each of the two agencies.

Overview

The 2025-26 budget package provides a total of $19.7 billion from various fund sources—the General Fund, a number of special funds, bond funds, and federal funds—for the departments overseen by CNRA and CalEPA. This amount represents 72 percent of total 2024-25 estimated expenditure levels. This significant year-to-year decrease is primarily due to significant one-time funding—mostly from the General Fund—available for the departments within both agencies in 2024-25, including large amounts of funds carried over from prior years. Figures 1 and 2 below show the funding totals for the major departments within CNRA and CalEPA. These totals incorporate authorized spending included in the budget package from Proposition 4 (the climate bond approved by voters in November 2024) and GGRF.

Cross-Cutting Issues

Proposition 4 Climate Bond Allocations

Budget Package Provides $3.5 Billion for First Year of Proposition 4 Implementation. As shown in Figure 3 below, the budget package authorizes the state to spend $3.5 billion, or slightly more than one third, of the $10 billion climate bond approved by voters through the November 2024 ballot. This amount was approved via three different 2025 budget actions: (1) $181 million provided through Chapter 2 (AB 100, Gabriel) in April 2025 (these funds were available for departments to spend during the final few months of 2024-25); (2) $2.9 million through Chapter 5 (AB 102, Gabriel); and (3) $3.3 billion through Chapter 104 (SB 105, Weiner). The budget package also authorized 79.5 new positions across 12 different departments to implement bond-funded programs. In order to help expedite bond implementation, budget trailer legislation—Chapter 106 (AB 149, Committee on Budget)—authorizes administering departments to use emergency regulations to develop and adopt guidelines and selection criteria for Proposition 4-funded programs. Please see our post, The 2025-26 California Spending Plan: Proposition 4, for more detailed information on Proposition 4 budget actions.

Budget Solutions

Budget Package Reduces About $900 Million From Prior Environmental Augmentations. Due to the state budget shortfall, the 2025-26 spending plan makes a number of reductions to previous and planned General Fund augmentations. Figure 4 below provides a summary of the reductions to environmental programs included in the 2025-26 budget agreement, totaling $898 million. As shown, most of these are within CNRA and CalEPA departments. The two largest reductions total $500 million from Proposition 98 General Fund that had been planned to support the purchase of and infrastructure for zero-emission school buses in 2025-26 as part of a previously-approved zero-emission vehicles (ZEV) package. (This action creates savings within the Proposition 98 school spending requirement.) Most of the rest of the funding shown in the figure was provided in 2024-25; as such, the budget package reverts the funds in order to achieve savings. In all but one case, these represent reversions of one-time appropriations, resulting in one-time General Fund savings. (We discuss the one ongoing reduction—$750,000 resulting from the Department of Water Resources [DWR] changing the frequency of publishing its groundwater bulletin—later in this post.)

Shifts Some Funding to Other Sources. The budget package also shifts spending for two environmental activities that had been planned for General Fund support to other sources in order to achieve General Fund savings without having programmatic impacts. These shifts include (1) using $1 billion from GGRF for operations of the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CalFire) and (2) relying on $35 million from the Lead-Acid Battery Cleanup Fund to support the Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC) in conducting clean-up activities at the Exide facility and surrounding communities. While both of these shifts apply just to 2025-26, the budget package includes language stating intent to provide additional GGRF funding to CalFire in future years to achieve General Fund savings. Specifically, if the General Fund continues to experience deficits, the plan intends that GGRF would cover $1.25 billion of CalFire’s costs in 2026-27, $500 million in 2027-28, and $500 million in 2028-29. If the General Fund is not projected to be in a deficit in 2026-27, GGRF would only cover $500 million for CalFire in that year.

Additionally, as noted in Figure 4, the budget package uses Proposition 4 to help offset the impacts of some General Fund reductions. Specifically, the budget reduces $298 million General Fund from previous appropriations for nine programs but also provides Proposition 4 funding for similar activities. The bond funds will help mitigate the programmatic impacts of the state providing less General Fund than it had originally planned for these programs. In some cases, however, the bond-supported programs—and, therefore, the projects that ultimately will end up being funded—may differ slightly from those that might have been funded with the General Fund, so this approach does not represent a dollar-for-dollar backfill in all cases.

Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund Expenditure Plan

Assumes $4.1 Billion in Total GGRF Expenditures. The budget package assumes a total of $4.1 billion in expenditures from GGRF in 2025-26. This includes $2.4 billion in statutorily-required appropriations—most of which are continuously appropriated—for the high-speed rail project and various other programs, such as for housing, transit, forest health, and drinking water. (Because most of the statutorily-required appropriations currently are set as a percentage of cap-and-trade auction proceeds, the amount they ultimately will receive is uncertain and will depend upon how much revenue is generated over the coming year.)

Most Discretionary Spending Directed to Support General Fund and Motor Vehicle Account. In addition to the statutorily required expenditures, the budget package also includes $1.7 billion in discretionary spending in 2025-26, as shown in Figure 5 below. Most of this— $1 billion—is related to the CalFire fund shift described above, replacing a like amount of General Fund to provide budget relief. Additionally, in order to help the Motor Vehicle Account remain solvent in 2025-26, the budget includes $81 million to pay for costs that otherwise would have to be paid by that account. (Please see our post, The 2025-26 California Spending Plan: Transportation, for more discussion of issues related to the Motor Vehicle Account.) The other discretionary allocations represent some, but not all, of the funding that was originally planned for 2025-26 as part of the 2024-25 multiyear GGRF expenditure plan. These include $368 million for the Transit and Intercity Rail Capital Program, $100 million to address local air pollutants in disadvantaged communities pursuant to Chapter 136 of 2017 (AB 617, Garcia), a total of $65 million for two ZEV-related programs, and $7 million for livestock methane reduction. (To identify which programs did and did not receive GGRF as planned for in previous years, please see our description of the prior multiyear funding plan in our September 2024 publication, The 2024-25 California Spending Plan: Natural Resources and Environmental Protection.)

Legislature Extended Cap-and-Invest Program Through 2045. Separate from the budget, in September 2025, the Legislature adopted two significant pieces of legislation related to the cap-and-trade program and GGRF. First, Chapter 117 of 2025 (AB 1207, Irwin) extended the sunset on the program from 2030 to 2045, renamed it “cap-and-invest,” and included various other changes. Second, Chapter 121 of 2025 (SB 840, Limón) revised the existing statutory allocation amounts that support particular activities starting in 2026-27, including changing many from being set percentages of GGRF revenues to fixed amounts. (We plan to discuss AB 1207 and SB 840 further in a forthcoming brief.)

Efficiency and Vacant Position Reductions

2025-26 Budget Implements Control Sections First Added in 2024-25. Control Sections 4.05 and 4.12 of the 2024-25 and 2025-26 budget acts directed the Department of Finance (DOF) to identify efficiencies to reduce costs without adverse effects on state services. (DOF exempted certain departments—including CalFire and the California Conservation Corps—from reductions pursuant to these control sections due to their role in wildfire response.) DOF subsequently worked with departments to implement these reductions. Please see the forthcoming “New and Ongoing Efforts to Achieve Efficiencies” section of our post, The 2025-26 California Spending Plan: Other Provisions, for more information on Control Sections 4.05 and 4.12. Below, we discuss how these control sections affect CNRA and CalEPA departments in the 2025-26 budget.

Reduces State Operations Funding for CNRA and CalEPA Departments. Control Section 4.05 directed savings to be achieved through “operational efficiencies and other cost reduction measures including, but not limited to, reorganizations, eliminations of boards and commissions, rate changes, contract reductions, elimination of excess positions, and the cancellation or postponement of information technology projects.” As shown in Figure 6, through Control Section 4.05 the budget package reduces $189 million across CNRA and CalEPA departments in 2025-26 and ongoing, including $38 million from the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, $29 million from the State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB), and $25 million from the California Air Resources Board (CARB). (The budget package scored about the same level of savings through this control section for the 2024-25 fiscal year.) These amounts reflect reductions made pursuant to AB 102. Of this total, 28 percent ($53 million) consists of reductions to General Fund spending and the remainder ($136 million) is from special funds. Due to the timing of when budget actions occurred and how DOF reflected these actions in its fiscal documents, some—but not all—of these state operations reductions are reflected in the department totals displayed earlier in Figures 1 and 2.

Scores Some Savings Related to Vacant Positions, With Additional Reductions and Position Eliminations Still Pending. Control Section 4.12 directed savings to be achieved by eliminating vacant positions and associated funding. The budget package scored $108 million in savings from vacant positions at CNRA and CalEPA pursuant to this control section for the 2024-25 fiscal year, but did not permanently eliminate any positions. As shown in the figure, Chapter 4 of 2025 (SB 101, Weiner) made $42 million in reductions pursuant to Control Section 4.12 in 2025-26. These reductions, nearly all from the General Fund, are reflected in the department totals displayed earlier in Figures 1 and 2. Subsequently, AB 102 included language in Control Section 4.12 directing DOF to provide the Legislature with supplementary information prior to making additional funding reductions in 2025-26 or permanently eliminating any vacant positions. Specifically, the Legislature—through the Joint Legislative Budget Committee—has until January 1, 2026, to review and potentially “nonconcur” with the administration’s proposals for permanently eliminating position authority (totaling 874 positions across CNRA and CalEPA departments). Depending on the outcome of that review and decision, DOF could reduce additional spending authority totaling up to $67 million annually from multiple special funds across CNRA and CalEPA departments in 2025-26 and ongoing pursuant to Control Section 4.12.

California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) Changes and Coastal Act Exemptions

Legislation Modifies Environmental Review Requirements for Urban Housing and Other Projects. Several pieces of budget trailer legislation authorize modifications to the traditional CEQA process in an effort to accelerate housing production and certain other development projects. Specifically, Chapter 22 of 2025 (AB 130, Committee on Budget) exempts qualified urban infill housing projects from CEQA. In addition, it amends the Coastal Act to prevent appeals of local permits for multifamily housing (four or more units) in the coastal zone on the basis of the project being located in a sensitive coastal resource area or not being the principally permitted use. Assembly Bill 130 also shortens coastal zone housing permit review times under the Permit Streamlining Act, generally from 180 to 90 days. Chapter 24 of 2025 (SB 131, Committee on Budget and Fiscal Review) further amends CEQA to require that housing development projects meeting all but one CEQA exemption criteria be reviewed solely on that issue. It also adds CEQA exemptions for various specified types of projects, including certain housing-related rezoning, farmworker housing, advanced manufacturing facilities, high-speed rail facilities, wildfire risk reduction projects, health clinics, day care centers, public parks, and nonmotorized recreational trail facilities. Additionally, it extends for four years (until 2032) an existing CEQA exemption for small disadvantaged community water system or state small water system projects. For more information about how this legislation—as well as Chapter 650 of 2025 (SB 158, Committee on Budget and Fiscal Review), which makes some refinements to the CEQA-related changes—affect housing development, please see our forthcoming post, The 2025-26 California Spending Plan: Housing, Homelessness, and Local Government.

Legislation Eases CEQA and Coastal Act Requirements for Official Olympics-Related Development. Assembly Bill 149 exempts from CEQA the construction of temporary facilities for the 2028 Olympic and Paralympic Games and also exempts any temporary Olympics facility located in the coastal zone from having to obtain a coastal development permit.

Natural Resources

California Natural Resources Agency

The budget provides $273 million from various fund sources to support CNRA in 2025-26, which represents a decrease of $446 million (62 percent) when compared to the revised 2024-25 expenditure level due primarily to the expiration of one-time funds. (This total includes funding the agency receives on behalf of the Ocean Protection Council and Salton Sea Conservancy.) The 2025-26 spending plan appropriates $91 million from Proposition 4 specifically for CNRA, including $47 million for the Urban Greening Program. Additionally, the budget includes a total of $77 million General Fund in 2025-26 for CNRA to coordinate and distribute across a variety of one-time efforts and projects. The largest of these include $13.6 million for restoration efforts at Clear Lake and $10 million for the Museum of Tolerance in Los Angeles.

Department of Forestry and Fire Protection

The budget provides $4.5 billion from various fund sources to support CalFire in 2025-26, which represents a decrease of $667 million (13 percent) when compared to the revised 2024-25 expenditure level. This total includes $305 million and 902 positions in 2025-26 to continue implementing CalFire’s shift to a 66-hour workweek, which is $106 million and 564 positions more than 2024-25. The spending plan also provides $279 million from Proposition 4 to CalFire for various activities (including $14 million each to pass through to the Wildfire Conservancy and Wildfire Foundation). Additionally, as discussed above, CalFire’s budget includes $1 billion from GGRF and a commensurate year-to-year reduction in General Fund. Notable other features of CalFire’s 2025-26 budget include the following:

Transition of Seasonal Firefighters to Permanent Classification. The budget provides $39 million General Fund in 2025-26, with budget bill language stating the Legislature’s intent to provide $78 million General Fund in 2026-27 and ongoing, for CalFire to begin transitioning some seasonal firefighter positions to a permanent classification. (Subsequent statutory revisions to the language clarified that all seasonal firefighter positions, not only those positions on hand crews, are eligible for this transition.) The language also states the Legislature’s intent to transition the remainder of the seasonal firefighter positions to permanent eventually, subject to future funding and legislation.

Wildfire County Coordinator Program. The budget includes $9.5 million General Fund in 2025-26 for CalFire to support the California Fire Safe Council’s Wildfire County Coordinator Program. This program supports coordinators in 47 of 58 counties who work with local organizations and residents to improve community wildfire preparedness through education, events, and grant funding.

Home Hardening Program. The budget provides $3 million General Fund in 2025-26 for a home hardening program at CalFire, subject to future legislation.

Capital Outlay Projects. The budget includes $260 million—$91.5 million General Fund and $168.5 million in lease revenue bonds—for CalFire capital outlay projects in 2025-26, of which $163 million is newly approved and $97 million was approved as part of previous budget agreements. These projects include $95 million for the Butte Fire Center, $17 million for the Prado Helitack Base, and $11 million for the Macdoel Fire Station. To achieve budget savings, the spending plan also reverts $32 million General Fund that was previously appropriated for the acquisition phase of a new CalFire training center, as highlighted earlier in Figure 4.

Department of Parks and Recreation

The budget provides $1.2 billion from various fund sources to support the Department of Parks and Recreation (Parks) in 2025-26, which represents a decrease of $494 million (28 percent) when compared to the revised 2024-25 expenditure level. This decrease is primarily due to the expiration of one-time funds that were available to Parks in 2024-25. Parks’ budget includes $440 million from Proposition 4 in 2025-26 for three activities: The Statewide Parks Program, reducing climate impacts on disadvantaged communities and expanding outdoor recreation, and deferred maintenance. Notable other features of Parks’ budget include the following:

California State Parks Library Pass Program. The budget transfers $6.75 million General Fund in 2025-26 to the State Parks and Recreation Fund to continue the California State Parks Library Pass Program until June 30, 2026. The program provides free access to most state parks through passes that can be checked out from public library branches throughout the state.

Park Restoration and Capital Outlay Projects. The budget appropriates $6 million General Fund in 2025-26 to restore Topanga State Park and Will Rogers State Historic Park, both of which were damaged by the Palisades Fire in January 2025. In addition, the budget includes $23.3 million ($3.6 million General Fund) for capital outlay projects at Parks including $9 million for the California Indian Heritage Center, $4.8 million for R.H. Meyer Memorial State Beach, and $3.6 million for Will Rogers State Historic Park.

Invasive Mussel Infestation Prevention Program and Increase to Harbors and Watercraft Revolving Fund (HWRF) Fee. Assembly Bill 149 expands the existing state quagga and zebra mussel infestation prevention program to include all invasive mussel species, including the golden mussel. The legislation also increases and renames the existing invasive mussel prevention fee and adjusts it every other year for inflation. This fee revenue is deposited in the HWRF. Because annual expenditures from that fund currently exceed its typical level of revenues, budget bill language requires the administration to develop a proposal no later than January 10, 2027 to keep the HWRF in structural balance on an ongoing basis. Correspondingly, AB 149 affirms the Legislature’s intent to address the HWRF imbalance in subsequent legislation that could include further increases in the invasive mussel prevention fee.

Department of Water Resources

The budget package includes a total of $3 billion from various fund sources to support DWR in 2025-26, including $318 million from the General Fund. (The total also includes roughly $1.4 billion in annual payments from water contractors for DWR’s work on the State Water Project that is continuously appropriated outside of the annual budget act.) The 2025-26 DWR budget is down a net $2 billion (40 percent) from the estimated 2024-25 expenditure level, due primarily to the expiration of one-time funds. Below we discuss several notable changes in the DWR budget.

Appropriates $684 Million in Proposition 4 Funding for Water Resilience Projects. The spending plan appropriates $684 million in 2025-26 out of the nearly $2 billion contained in Proposition 4 for DWR. Appropriations include $232 million for the Dam Safety and Climate Resilience Program, $148 million for Salton Sea projects, $123 million for the Flood Control Subventions Program, $63 million for State Plan of Flood Control projects, $30 million for groundwater management activities, and $8 million for improvement and management of stream gages. For several other programs, the spending plan includes small augmentations to support planning and program design in 2025-26, with project funding to be appropriated in future years.

Includes $14.5 Million General Fund for Flood Management Activities. The spending plan provides $12.5 million in 2025-26 for state operations costs associated with management of urban flood risk reduction projects conducted in collaboration with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The budget package also approves $2 million in both 2025-26 and 2026-27 for the state’s cost share of the Yolo Bypass Comprehensive Study conducted by the Army Corps.

Provides Spending Authority for Salton Sea Projects. The state has received three installments totaling $245 million from the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation as part of the Inflation Reduction Act (2022) for projects at the Salton Sea. Prior years’ budgets provided spending authority for the first two installments. The 2025-26 spending plan provides $178 million in multiyear authority—$100 million in 2025-26, $60 million in 2026-27, $12 million in 2027-28, and $6 million in 2028-29—for the final installment plus a separate $2 million federal reimbursement agreement. In addition, the spending plan allows DWR to receive reimbursements in 2025-26 from CNRA ($8 million from Proposition 68 [2018]) and the California Department of Fish and Wildlife ($3 million from Proposition 84 [2006]) for planning and construction of projects, as well as the aforementioned $148 million appropriation from Proposition 4. While last year’s budget included $1.4 million in ongoing GGRF for DWR staffing costs for Salton Sea restoration projects, the current agreement eliminates this ongoing appropriation beginning in 2025-26.

Reduces Prior General Fund Augmentations by Nearly $80 Million. As noted earlier in Figure 4, the spending plan reduces several prior-year DWR General Fund appropriations to help solve the budget problem. These include $47 million for dam safety, $15 million for systemwide flood risk reduction, $11 million for flood management, and $5 million in the Urban Streams Restoration Program. (The impacts of the first two of these reductions will be somewhat offset by the new appropriations from Proposition 4.) Additionally, beginning in 2025-26, DWR will reduce the frequency with which it publishes a groundwater bulletin (from every five years to every ten), saving $750,000 annually on an ongoing basis.

Reduces Planned GGRF Appropriations for Oroville Pump Storage. The final GGRF spending plan eliminates planned funding for a pump storage project at the Oroville Dam. (This project is intended to allow the facility to use some of its existing pump storage capacity, while limiting the potential adverse environmental impacts associated with pumping.) The project received $10 million from the General Fund in 2023-24 to begin planning and was set to receive $230 million in total from GGRF across three years beginning in 2025-26 for later phases of the project, including construction. This year’s budget package, however, does not include the planned augmentation of $30 million in 2025-26 and does not specifically identify this as a priority for out-year GGRF, meaning that any subsequent support for the project will have to be requested through a future budget process.

Coastal Agencies

State Lands Commission (SLC). The spending plan includes two General Fund appropriations for SLC to carry out legally required activities. First, it provides $12.5 million on a one-time basis for SLC to continue decommissioning activities at Rincon Island in Ventura County, which involves remediation of soil, groundwater, and interstitial water contamination associated with oil and gas production from offshore state leases. The budget agreement also approves $4.1 million in 2025-26, $4.1 million in 2026-27, and $4.4 million in 2027-28 for restoration activities at the Bolsa Chica Lowlands in Orange County. Required activities include tidal inlet dredging and ongoing maintenance and operations.

State Coastal Conservancy (SCC). The spending plan provides SCC with $10.7 million from the Violation Remediation Account and $12 million in reimbursement authority from the State Coastal Conservancy Fund. The former will fund coastal projects—selected in collaboration with the California Coastal Commission (which enforces Coastal Act violations and collects associated penalties)—near where the violations occurred. The latter will allow SCC to receive expected funding from state and federal agencies that will support local grants. The spending plan also appropriates Proposition 4 funding to SCC for a variety of activities, including $63 million for coastal resilience activities, $51 million to support the Great Redwood Trail Agency, and $41 million to support San Francisco Bay restoration projects.

California Coastal Commission. The spending plan approves funding—$565,000 in 2025-26, $1.2 million in 2026-27, and $1.8 million in 2027-28 and ongoing, all from the General Fund—and eight permanent positions for the commission to assist local coastal governments in aligning their Local Coastal Programs (LCPs) with zoning changes in their housing elements within one year (as required by Chapter 282 of 2024 [AB 3093, Ward]. It also provides one-time funding—$107,000 General Fund—to implement Chapter 454 of 2024 (SB 1077, Blakespear), which requires the commission, in collaboration with the Department of Housing and Community Development, to issue guidance for local governments about updating their LCPs to simplify the permitting process for accessory dwelling units in the coastal zone.

San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission (BCDC). The spending plan includes $500,000 in 2025-26 and $55,000 in 2026-27 from the Bay Fill Clean-Up and Abatement Fund to procure an electronic regulatory management system that will allow BCDC to comprehensively track and manage permits, including collecting fees. Associated statutory changes specify that the fund can be used for technology services, programs, and personnel supporting authorized uses of the fund.

California Energy Commission (CEC)

The budget includes a total of $1.4 billion from special funds and federal funds for CEC in 2025-26. This is a significant decrease from the estimated prior-year expenditure level of $2.8 billion, due largely to the expiration of one-time funding. The magnitude of the year-to-year decrease was partially offset by various one-time augmentations made to CEC’s budget in 2025-26, including $275 million from Proposition 4 primarily for offshore wind projects and $40 million from GGRF for heavy-duty ZEV charging infrastructure. As noted above, the budget package does not include $125 million that had been planned for 2025-26 from Proposition 98 General Fund for zero-emission school bus infrastructure. Two other notable modifications to CEC’s budget include the following:

Provides Authority to Use Various Federal Funds. The budget includes $672 million in Federal Trust Fund expenditure authority and $12 million in reimbursement authority related to the anticipated receipt of various federal grants funded by the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, most notably from the Grid Resilience and Innovation Partnership program.

Provides Augmentations for Various Energy Projects. The budget includes $9 million from the General Fund for carbon-free energy projects. This includes (1) $5 million to support nuclear fusion projects, including related to the Fusion Research and Development Innovation Initiative; and (2) $4 million for the CADEMO offshore wind project, which is planned off the coast of Point Arguello (near Vandenberg Space Force Base).

Environmental Protection

California Air Resources Board

The spending plan includes a total of $956 million for CARB in 2025-26, almost entirely from special funds. This represents a significant decrease compared to CARB’s estimated expenditure level in 2024-25 of $1.4 billion due to expiration of one-time funding. As noted above, the budget package provides some discretionary GGRF for CARB—including $100 million for the AB 617 Community Air Protection Program—but does not include $375 million that had been planned for 2025-26 from Proposition 98 General Fund for purchasing zero-emission school buses. We discuss some other notable changes to CARB’s 2025-26 budget below.

Funds Hybrid and Zero-Emission Truck and Bus Voucher Incentive Project (HVIP). The budget includes $132 million from the Air Pollution Control Fund (APCF) for HVIP, which is a program that provides point-of-sale rebates to help reduce the purchase price of zero-emission trucks and buses. This funding is available as a result of a legal settlement between the state and Hino Motors (a subsidiary of Toyota).

Augments Funding for Clean Cars 4 All. In addition to the $25 million in GGRF provided for the Clean Cars 4 All program highlighted previously in Figure 5, in April 2025, the Legislature enacted AB 100 which provided an additional $20 million from the Enhanced Fleet Modernization Account on a one-time basis to support the Clean Cars 4 All program operated by air districts. This included a new appropriation of $17 million and the redirection of $3 million that previously had been provided to support a related program, the Enhanced Fleet Modernization program.

Supports Mobile Source Laboratory Equipment Support and Maintenance. The budget includes $8 million on an ongoing basis from the Certification and Compliance Fund (CCF) to support CARB’s mobile source laboratory in Riverside, which helps ensure that manufacturers meet the state’s emissions standards. This funding will support additional costs for maintenance, service, and training contracts, as well as additional equipment-replacements. The budget package also includes related budget trailer legislation that specifies that the deficiency fines that CARB assesses manufacturers are to be considered fees and deposited into the CCF. This change is expected to enable CCF to support these additional costs.

Extends Support to Implement Carbon Capture Legislation. The budget includes a total of $2 million in 2025-26 from the Cost of Implementation Account (rising to $4 million ongoing) and 18 permanent positions to continue implementing Chapter 359 of 2022 (SB 905, Caballero), which was originally supported with limited-term resources. This legislation requires CARB to establish a Carbon Capture, Removal, Utilization, and Storage Program in order to develop and implement a regulatory framework for carbon capture and storage and carbon dioxide removal technologies.

Supports E15 Fuel Regulation Development and Implementation. The budget includes $2 million from APCF in 2025-26 and ongoing and 10 permanent positions to complete the regulatory process to allow the use of up to 15 percent ethanol in gasoline (known as the E15 fuel blend), as well as to conduct ongoing program implementation and enforcement of potential future E15 regulations. (After the passage of the budget, the Governor signed Chapter 247 of 2025 [AB 30, Alvarez], which authorizes the use of E15 until CARB completes its regulatory process.)

Funds Implementation of Zero-Emission Airport Shuttle (ZEAS) Regulations. The budget includes 10 permanent positions starting in 2025-26 and related funding of $2 million from APCF starting in 2026-27 to support the implementation of the ZEAS regulations. (The Legislature rejected without prejudice funding proposed for the Zero-Emission Forklift and Advanced Clean Fleets regulations in light of the lack of federal waivers required to enforce these regulations.)

Includes Trailer Bill Legislation Related to Regulatory Fee Authority. The budget package includes Chapter 109 (SB 153, Committee on Budget and Fiscal Review), which authorizes CARB to assess fees related to implementing its Transport Refrigeration Unit regulations. (The Legislature did not adopt the broader regulatory fee authority that the administration had initially proposed in January.)

State Water Resources Control Board

The spending plan includes a total of $1.9 billion from all funding sources in 2025-26 for SWRCB, including $74 million from the General Fund. This represents a year-to-year reduction of $574 million, or 24 percent, mostly due to the expiration of prior one-time and bond funding. (As we discuss in our forthcoming post, The 2025-26 California Spending Plan: Housing, Homelessness, and Local Government, the budget package also suspends a number of municipal stormwater permits issued by regional water quality control boards.)

Includes $396 Million From Proposition 4 for Water Resilience Activities. Proposition 4 includes a total of nearly $1.2 billion for six programs administered by SWRCB. The 2025-26 spending plan provides project funding for four of these programs: $183 million for drinking water grants and loans, $11 million for tribal drinking water infrastructure projects, $153 million for water reuse and recycling, and $47 million to address water pollution in California-Mexico cross-border rivers and coastal waters. In addition, the budget approves planning dollars for multibenefit urban stormwater management and water data management.

Covers Groundwater Management Costs With Special Fund Loan. The Sustainable Groundwater Management Act (SGMA) requires SWRCB to pay for its SGMA-related costs with revenues from fees it imposes on groundwater extractors. SWRCB can impose these fees when a groundwater basin has been designated as probationary due to noncompliance with SGMA. Although SWRCB has designated two basins—Tulare and Tule—as probationary, it has not yet been able to collect fees. To bridge the gap, the spending plan authorizes a loan of $16.4 million over three years (about $5.5 million per year) from the Underground Storage Tank Cleanup Fund to SWRCB’s SGMA program to support 22 existing positions. The loan must be repaid (with future fee revenues or General Fund) within four years.

Supports SWRCB’s Staffing Costs to Regulate Small Water Systems in Monterey County. The County of Monterey’s local primacy agency delegation for regulating public small water systems was recently terminated, meaning SWRCB must take over these responsibilities. The spending plan includes $2.7 million annually from the Safe Drinking Water Account beginning in 2025-26 and 12 permanent positions to carry out this regulatory program.

Reduces Prior-Year General Fund Spending and Planned GGRF Augmentations. As noted earlier, the spending plan reduces 2024-25 General Fund spending on water recycling by $51 million as part of the effort to resolve the state’s budget deficit. It also does not include previously planned 2025-26 GGRF augmentations of $15 million for water recycling and groundwater cleanup and $30 million for drinking water and wastewater. The impacts of all three of these modifications are offset to some degree by the new Proposition 4 spending.

Department of Toxic Substances Control

The budget provides $448 million from various fund sources to support DTSC in 2025-26. This reflects a $166 million (27 percent) decrease when compared to the estimated 2024-25 expenditure level. The decrease is largely associated with the expiration of one-time General Fund that DTSC received to address brownfields across the state and for cleanup activities related to the Exide facility in the City of Vernon.",https://lao.ca.gov/Content/Images/favicon.ico,N,,2025-10-17 00:02:20.636944

1. Amazon unveils plans for X-energy’s debut nuclear plant

A rendering of the future Cascade Advanced Energy Facility. Amazon

A year after Amazon invested in the small modular reactor developer X-energy, the tech giant has unveiled its plans to build a nearly gigawatt-sized plant in southeastern Washington, where it will install the nuclear company’s next-generation technology for the first time. The Cascade Advanced Energy Facility is set to begin construction “by the end of this decade,” with hopes of generating power from up to a dozen of X-energy’s 80-megawatt high-temperature gas-cooled reactors sometime “in the 2030s.” Amazon plans to build the plant in three phases, with four reactors at each stage, eventually reaching 960 megawatts in capacity. Located in Richland, Washington, along the Columbia River, the facility will nearly double the output of the Pacific Northwest’s only nuclear plant, the nearby Energy Northwest’s Columbia Generating Station.

In a sign of what Heatmap’s Katie Brigham called “the nuclear dealmaking boom” back in August, rival microreactor developer Oklo suggested at a recent public meeting in Tennessee that it may propose building some of its reactors near the Oak Ridge site of its debut nuclear waste recycling project, the Knoxville News Sentinel reported Monday. On Tuesday, meanwhile, the U.S. Army announced its new Janus program, which aims to supply bases by 2028 with microreactors like the ones Oklo aims to build, which generate 20 megawatts of electricity or less. The reactors would be owned and operated by private companies. “What resilience means to us is that we have power, no matter what, 24-7,” Jeff Waksman, principal deputy assistant secretary of the Army, told The Wall Street Journal.

2. Energy Department gives transmission project $1.6 billion loan

The Department of Energy’s Loan Programs Office has largely revoked deals made under the previous administration since President Donald Trump returned to office. But on Thursday morning, the agency’s in-house lender announced a $1.6 billion loan guarantee to a subsidiary of utility giant American Electric Power to upgrade and rebuild about 5,000 miles of transmission lines across Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Oklahoma, and West Virginia. “This loan guarantee will not only help modernize the grid and expand transmission capacity but will help position the United States to win the AI race and grow our manufacturing base,” Secretary of Energy Chris Wright said in a press release.

The move came a day after a federal judge blocked the Trump administration’s effort to fire thousands of federal workers amid the ongoing government shutdown. At a hearing Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Susan Illston, a Clinton appointee based in California, granted labor unions’ request for a temporary restraining order to halt the dismissals. The hearing took place at the same time White House budget director Russ Vought appeared on the late conservative commentator Charlie Kirk’s podcast to preview his plans to lay off as many as 10,000 federal workers as the shutdown continued. The hearing will pause the job cuts for the roughly 4,000 workers who received notice so far. Illson said during the hearing that she granted the temporary restraining order because administration officials had “taken advantage of the lapse in government spending, government functioning, to assume that all bets are off, that the laws don’t apply to them anymore, and that they can impose the structures that they like on the government situation that they don’t like,” News From The States reported. “Things are being done before they’re thought through — very much ready, fire, aim.” Nearly 200 employees at the Department of Energy began receiving notices last week, as I wrote in yesterday’s newsletter.

3. Germany considers restarting the Nord Stream 2 pipeline

The underwater explosion of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline connecting Germany to Russia’s gas supply remains one of the world’s biggest geopolitical whodunnits, and Berlin’s fellow European Union members seem keen to keep it that way. In just the past two days, Poland and Italy blocked extradition requests to send suspected saboteurs to Germany for trial. But the Germans aren’t just looking to figure out who’s responsible for destroying the megaproject. The Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy is considering restarting the certification process for the pipeline, the daily newspaper Der Tagesspiegel reported Wednesday. The previous German government had ruled out a restart of the pipeline in March after news broke that Russian President Vladimir Putin’s business allies were angling to restore the project. In June, the new government under conservative Chancellor Friedrich Merz began examining legal avenues to block any future plans to reactivate the pipeline, the Financial Times reported at the time. But under current law, the economic ministry said this week a restart “cannot be ruled out in the medium term.”

4. Ohio fast-tracks energy construction on coal sites

Ohio passed a new law to fast-track energy projects on former coal mines and brownfields, Canary Media reported Wednesday. Called House Bill 15, the legislation took effect in August and lets the state’s Department of Development designate the former industrial sites as “priority investment areas” at the request of local governments. Roughly a third of Ohio’s 88 counties ban wind, solar, or both, but the language in the bill makes clear that “it was meant to be technology-neutral,” Rebecca Mellino, a climate and energy policy associate at The Nature Conservancy, told Canary’s Kathiann M. Kowalski.

A transition from coal could yield significant health benefits, as The New York Times reported on Tuesday. A recent study found that, when a coal-processing facility near Pittsburgh shut down, the number of emergency room visits for respiratory issues in the surrounding area dropped by about 20% in the month following the closure.

5. New AI tool could help tap 42% more conventional oil resources

The world’s annual consumption of oil isn’t expected to peak until the mid-2030s, and by 2050 it will reach a cumulative 1 trillion barrels, according to the consultancy Wood Mackenzie’s forecast. But production that’s either already onstream or ready for development is expected to gradually decline to 650 billion barrels per year by the mid century. What will make up the difference? “Traditional exploration will play its part but can’t get anywhere near bridging a gap of this scale,” Wood Mackenzie analysts wrote in a blog post on Wednesday. “Even the 21st century’s biggest new play, Guyana, with 15 billion barrels of oil, barely makes a dent.” To identify potential new resources, Wood Mackenzie rolled out a new AI-powered benchmark called Analogues, which “uses a machine learning method known as clustering to identify each field’s closest matches across 60 different attributes spanning rock properties, fluid characteristics, and commercial factors.” The AI tool could increase the share of recoverable conventional oil reserves by nearly 42%.

THE KICKER

Fusion energy is rapidly accelerating in the U.S., and the Department of Energy is poised to release a national plan for speeding up the deployment of the technology. In the meantime, states can prepare by beefing up regulatory capacity, speeding up permitting, clearing interconnection queues, and creating special tax credits. That’s according to a new roadmap from the Clean Air Task Force. “As fusion energy moves closer to commercial reality, states have a window of opportunity to prepare,” Jack Moore, a fusion policy consultant at CATF, wrote in a blog post. “Proactive policy design today can help states position themselves to create an effective environment for fusion energy deployment tomorrow.”",https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MTc2NDE2My9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTgwNDU0MzUzOX0.jR6Ao8kNxFEfCIKN9N55KaFS22NQrAGjet4dKt_CnHk/image.jpg?width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C100%2C0%2C100,N,,2025-10-16 23:05:47.123317

The world is falling behind on its renewable energy and efficiency goals despite record progress last year, says a report from the International Renewable Energy Agency, the COP30 Brazilian Presidency, and the Global Renewables Alliance.

In 2024, global renewable capacity additions reached 582GW. However, this is not enough to reach the COP28 UAE Consensus target of tripling renewables to 11.2TW by 2030.

Meeting that goal now demands 1,122GW of added capacity every year from 2025 onwards, requiring annual growth to accelerate to 16.6% through the decade, according to the second official tracking report on the landmark energy goals set by the UAE Consensus at COP28.

The progress report, Delivering on the UAE Consensus: Tracking progress toward tripling renewable energy capacity and doubling energy efficiency by 2030, also highlights that energy efficiency is an equal concern.

Global energy intensity improved by just 1% in 2024, far below the 4% annual gains needed to meet the UAE Consensus goal and keep the 1.5°C target alive.

The report calls for urgent action to:

Integrate renewable targets into national climate plans (NDC 3.0) ahead of COP30 in Belém.

Double collective NDC ambition to align with the global renewables goal.

Scale investment in renewables to at least $1.4trln per year in 2025-30 – more than doubling the $624bln invested in 2024.

Ben Backwell, Chair of the Global Renewables Alliance, comments, ‘The private sector is driving the energy transition, providing three-quarters of global clean energy investment. Our industries, led by wind, solar and hydropower, are already delivering growth, jobs and security.

'What we need now are long-term government plans that match national ambitions; we need pipelines that deliver projects. Plans must deliver enabling action on grids and storage and help maximise the benefits of the energy transition. This report shows that the march to renewable energy abundance is underway - and it’s time for us to accelerate.’

Everyone who’s not Duke Energy is still poring over this massive filing.","Duke Energy filed its 2025 resource plan earlier this month. The filing has drawn sharp criticism from environmental and clean energy advocates, and even has some business groups skeptical about future rate hikes.

WFAE’s climate reporter Zachary Turner sat down with host Nick de la Canal to break down what you need to know:

Nick de la Canal: To begin, what is this plan, and why should we care about it?

Zachary Turner: Duke files a resource plan every two years. It’s a roadmap that says what Duke’s going to build, like new power plants, when it’s going to build them, and about how much it’s going to cost ratepayers.

It also projects how much energy folks will need, and how the utility will supply it while lowering greenhouse gas emissions. Ideally.

De la Canal: Ideally?

Turner: Well, Duke’s resource plan also details how the utility will reach carbon neutrality by 2050. This means eliminating all greenhouse gas emissions that the utility doesn’t plan to offset with carbon credits.

Until earlier this year, the state mandated Duke to reduce emissions by 70% of 2005 levels by 2030 -- which is just five years away.

De la Canal: Right. That brings us to the differences between this plan and the 2023 plan. So, what’s changed?

Turner: The changes in this plan reflect the changes in the federal and state legislative landscape.

President Trump is ending clean energy tax credits, but preserving or creating incentives for battery storage and nuclear. He’s also putting his administration’s full weight behind fossil fuels.

Meanwhile, the state legislature rolled back that key 2030 climate target and made financing new nuclear reactors less risky for Duke Energy.

The result is a plan that pumps the brakes on solar energy, punts on wind energy and leans more heavily on natural gas and battery storage in the short term. Carbon pollution will go up during the next decade, with new gas plants coming online, and coal plants running up to an extra four years.

De la Canal: That makes sense. If the utility burns more fossil fuels, then its carbon emissions also go up.

Turner: Exactly. Burning fossil fuels is a primary driver of climate change. It’s also potentially driving up customers’ power bills, tying customer rates to fuels like natural gas that have volatile prices. Senior attorney David Neal with the Southern Environmental Law Center brought up that point at a recent conference in Raleigh:

David Neal: A big consequence of removing the interim target is unlocking Duke's plans to build more gas plants in the near term and to delay coal retirements, and that is going to put so much risk on customers

Turner: The plan also bets big on new nuclear reactors coming online in the late 2030s to curb those emissions and maybe even come close to meeting the 2050 carbon neutrality target.

De la Canal: What does that mean for the average person?

Turner: Right now, this is just a proposal. But if the commission approves this plan, it means bills will go up. Duke forecasts an unprecedented increase in energy demand over the next 10-15 years. That means building new infrastructure, increasing bills by an average 2.1% annually over the next 10 years.

There are also air quality concerns for power plant neighbors. For folks living near one of three coal plants, it means those facilities will continue running, with the Cliffside plant in Cleveland County running until 2040.

De la Canal: What are people saying about the plan?

Turner: Some business groups like Duke’s “all of the above” approach, because Duke markets this as the cheapest and most reliable pathway.

However, other groups, like the Carolina Utility Customers Association, worry more natural gas plants will strain North Carolina’s gas supply for industrial companies.

Other concerns about the plan fall into a few main camps:

There’s the climate problem. This plan goes against international climate goals to reduce near-term carbon emissions. We know Hurricane Helene and Tropical Storm Chantal were made worse by warmer ocean temperatures. Extreme heat and sea level rise continue to be a concern, and these problems don’t just go away if we reach carbon neutrality by 2050, and they certainly get worse the longer we burn fossil fuels.

Next, some groups worry that Duke plans to build too much new infrastructure. If Duke builds out a bunch of new gas-powered turbines for giant new electricity-guzzling customers like data centers who don’t ultimately come, ratepayers will get stuck with the bill.

De la Canal: What comes next?

Everyone who’s not Duke Energy is still poring over this massive filing. In the coming months, folks will comment on it and some groups might submit their own independent modeling of energy demand. The state’s new Energy Task Force, for example, will be trying to verify Duke’s findings.

Next year, the utilities commission will hold public hearings across the state before it takes a vote.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6ab7e45/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5568x2923+0+294/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe0%2F60%2F6413e56f4efeb467895c93bb33be%2F011423-duke-asheville-plant.JPG,N,,2025-10-16 23:06:02.406588

Our work to advance clean energy was gutted by the federal administration in its recent termination of nearly $8 billion of federal grants.

IREC is an independent, non-partisan organization operating in states all across the country. However, because we are registered in New York, three top-performing national programs that IREC leads were targeted and eliminated last week as a punitive shutdown ploy, including our celebrated SolSmart program which has worked with nearly 600 local governments—representing one-third of the U.S. population—to cut red tape and unlock solar power from rural towns to big cities in both “red” and “blue” states. Terminating these contracts without cause is illegal, but we have already been forced to lay off many of our high-performing staff members.

I am reaching out to you as a loyal supporter of IREC. Despite the policy attack on clean energy from this administration, IREC’s mission has not changed:

Building the foundation for the rapid adoption of clean energy and energy efficiency, to benefit people, the economy, and our planet.

Connecting veterans to solar jobs? Placing more than a thousand new apprentices in clean energy? Building energy resilience hubs in Puerto Rico communities plagued by power outages? Providing the authoritative data on the state of the solar workforce through the National Solar Jobs Census?

The program, called “Solar For All,” was established in 2022 under the Inflation Reduction Act and had appropriated grants to deploy rooftop and community solar projects.
The EPA has been aggressive in its attempts to claw back clean energy funding approved under the Biden administration.
EPA’s decision “jeopardizes” about $156 million for Washington state, according to the release.
That lawsuit says EPA violated the individual grant agreements it made with states and state energy authorities when it clawed its money back.","More than 20 states sued the Environmental Protection Agency on Thursday, challenging the agency’s decision to cancel a $7 billion program that aimed to make solar power accessible to low-income households.

The program, called “Solar For All,” was established in 2022 under the Inflation Reduction Act and had appropriated grants to deploy rooftop and community solar projects. It was part of the Biden administration’s push to reduce carbon pollution and was supposed to make solar power more accessible to nearly a million additional U.S. households.

But in August, the EPA announced that the program had been canceled and withdrew about 90% of grant funds from the accounts in which states had received the awards, according to the lawsuit.

The EPA has been aggressive in its attempts to claw back clean energy funding approved under the Biden administration. The new lawsuit will test whether the agency has overextended its reach in this case. The states behind the legal challenge had hoped that the funding would boost solar supply, reduce greenhouse gas emissions associated with electricity production and lower the price of energy.

“Congress passed a solar energy program to help make electricity costs more affordable, but the administration is ignoring the law and focused on the conspiracy theory that climate change is a hoax,” Washington State Attorney General Nick Brown said in a news release. EPA’s decision “jeopardizes” about $156 million for Washington state, according to the release.

Earlier this month, a group of nonprofits and solar installers filed a similar lawsuit over the program’s cancellation.

In response to questions about the newest suit, the White House directed NBC News to the EPA, which declined comment on pending litigation, its typical practice.

The states behind the lawsuit all have Democrat attorneys general or governors. Washington, Arizona and Minnesota are leading the challenge. The complaint was filed in the Western District of Washington.

The lawsuit alleges that EPA “unilaterally and illegally terminated” the program, violating the Administrative Procedures Act, which determines how federal agencies can operate. It also says EPA overreached its “constitutional authority” by trying to cancel a program and funding that had been approved by Congress.

The new lawsuit is part of a two-pronged approach states are taking to fight the Trump administration’s cutbacks to clean energy programs passed under President Joe Biden.

On Wednesday, a similar group of plaintiffs, including states and state energy organizations, filed a separate complaint over the cancellation of individual grant agreements in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims.

That lawsuit says EPA violated the individual grant agreements it made with states and state energy authorities when it clawed its money back.

The lawsuit claims that EPA used an “an erroneous and bad faith interpretation” of the “One Big Beautiful Bill,” which passed under the Trump administration, to justify its actions.

The lawsuit acknowledges that the act gave the administration some ability to rescind Inflation Reduction Act funds, but it argues that the administration was only allowed to take funds that hadn’t already been given away to grantees.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-10/251016-solar-farm-gk-cfecaf.jpg",N,,2025-10-16 21:04:13.705735

A total of 223 projects were terminated after a review determined they did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs or were not economically viable, the Energy Department said.
Electric utilities that receive loans through the program must provide assurances to the government that financial benefits from the financing will be passed on to customers, the Energy Department said.
Wright, in a conference call with reporters, distinguished the AEP loan guarantee from a $4.9 billion federal loan guarantee the department cancelled in July.
The loan guarantee to AEP was among those conditionally approved under Biden, a fact Wright acknowledged to reporters.","WASHINGTON (AP) — The Department of Energy said Thursday it has finalized a $1.6 billion loan guarantee to a subsidiary of one of the nation's largest power companies to upgrade nearly 5,000 miles of transmission lines across five states, mostly in the Midwest, for largely fossil fuel-run energy.

AEP Transmission will upgrade power lines in Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Oklahoma and West Virginia to enhance enhance grid reliability and capacity, the Energy Department said. The project, first offered under the Biden administration, is meant to help meet surging electricity demand from data centers and artificial intelligence.

Ohio-based American Electric Power, which owns AEP Transmission, is one of the nation's largest utilities, serving 5.6 million customers in 11 states. It primarily produces electricity from coal, natural gas and nuclear power, along with renewable resources such as wind and hydroelectric power.

Thursday's announcement deepens the Trump administration’s commitment to traditional, polluting energy sources even as it works to discourage the U.S. from clean energy use.

Earlier this month, the administration cancelled $7.6 billion in grants that supported hundreds of clean energy projects in 16 states, all of which voted for Democrat Kamala Harris in last year’s presidential election. A total of 223 projects were terminated after a review determined they did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs or were not economically viable, the Energy Department said.

The cancellations include up to $1.2 billion for California’s hydrogen hub aimed at developing clean-burning hydrogen fuels to power ships and heavy-duty trucks. A hydrogen project costing up to $1 billion in the Pacific Northwest also was cancelled.

The loan guarantee finalized Thursday is the first offered by the Trump administration under the recently renamed Energy Dominance Financing program created by the massive tax-and-spending law approved this summer by congressional Republicans and signed by President Donald Trump. Electric utilities that receive loans through the program must provide assurances to the government that financial benefits from the financing will be passed on to customers, the Energy Department said.

The project and others being considered will help ensure that Americans ""will have access to affordable, reliable and secure energy for decades to come,” Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in a statement.

“The president has been clear: America must reverse course from the energy subtraction agenda of past administrations and strengthen our electrical grid,'' Wright said, adding that modernizing the grid and expanding transmission capacity ""will help position the United States to win the AI race and grow our manufacturing base.”

The upgrades supported by the federal financing will replace existing transmission lines in existing rights-of-way with new lines capable of carrying more energy, the power company said.

More than 2,000 miles of transmission lines in Ohio serving 1.5 million people will be replaced, along with more than 1,400 miles in Indiana and Michigan serving 600,000 customers, the company said. An additional 1,400 miles in Oklahoma, serving about 1.2 million people and 26 miles in West Virginia, serving 460,000 people, will be replaced.

The projects will create about 1,100 construction jobs, the company said.

The loan guarantee will save customers money and improve reliability while supporting economic growth in the five states, said Bill Fehrman, AEP's chairman, president and chief executive officer. “The funds we will save through this program enable us to make additional investments to enhance service for our customers,"" he added.

Wright, in a conference call with reporters, distinguished the AEP loan guarantee from a $4.9 billion federal loan guarantee the department cancelled in July. That money would have boosted the planned Grain Belt Express, a new high-voltage transmission line set to deliver solar and wind-generated electricity from the Midwest to eastern states.

The Energy Department said at the time it was “not critical for the federal government to have a role” in the first phase of the $11 billion project planned by Chicago-based Invenergy. The department also questioned whether the project could meet strict financial conditions required, a claim Wright repeated Thursday.

“Ultimately that is a commercial enterprise that needs private developers,” Wright said. The company has indicated the Grain Belt project will go forward.

Trump and Wright have repeatedly derided wind and solar energy as unreliable and opposed efforts to combat climate change by moving away from fossil fuels. Wright said the Grain Belt Express loan was among billions of dollars worth of commitments “rushed out the door” in the waning days of former President Joe Biden’s administration.

The loan guarantee to AEP was among those conditionally approved under Biden, a fact Wright acknowledged to reporters.

“Not all of the (Biden-era) projects were nonsense,"" he said, adding that he was “happy to move forward” with the transmission upgrade.",https://images.wral.com/asset/business/2025/10/16/22202083/68f133363ea51-media_74dbfe848d1e42769417ea585d121498-DMID1-68o9ahl6v-640x480.jpg,N,,2025-10-16 21:05:07.000482

Three of the nation’s eight existing LNG export terminals are located in Cameron Parish, and several more are proposed or under construction there.
Louisiana’s attorney general vowed to appeal the ruling, which vacated the Louisiana Department of Conservation and Energy’s coastal use permit for the facility.
“This is the first time any court has vacated a permit for an LNG facility based on the government’s refusal to consider climate change impacts,” said Clay Garside, an attorney representing the Sierra Club and other environmental groups.
In regulatory filings, the Louisiana Department of Conservation and Energy said that “climate change is currently beyond the scope” of the state’s regulatory review.","NEW ORLEANS (AP) — A Louisiana judge has tossed out a key permit for a liquefied natural gas facility that won approval from President Donald Trump’s administration, ordering a state review of how the facility’s planet-warming emissions would affect Gulf Coast communities vulnerable to sea-level rise and extreme weather.

Last week, a judge from Louisiana’s 38th Judicial District Court effectively halted construction of Commonwealth LNG by ordering state regulators to analyze the facility’s climate change and environmental justice-related impacts, in conjunction with the broader LNG buildout in southwest Louisiana’s Cameron Parish.

Three of the nation’s eight existing LNG export terminals are located in Cameron Parish, and several more are proposed or under construction there.

Louisiana’s attorney general vowed to appeal the ruling, which vacated the Louisiana Department of Conservation and Energy’s coastal use permit for the facility.

“This is the first time any court has vacated a permit for an LNG facility based on the government’s refusal to consider climate change impacts,” said Clay Garside, an attorney representing the Sierra Club and other environmental groups.

Earlier this year, Trump reversed a Biden-era pause on exports of liquefied natural gas, or LNG, as part of his goal to boost natural gas exports and promote “energy dominance.”

Last year, the Biden administration’s Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm’s had warned that “unfettered exports” of liquefied natural gas would increase planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions — a statement reflecting the findings of a Department of Energy report released in December.

Trump-appointed Energy Secretary Chris Wright, a fossil fuel executive, has moved to fast-track the buildout of LNG facilities, including Commonwealth LNG, which received an export authorization within weeks of Trump’s inauguration.

“Cameron Parish is ground zero for the relentless expansion of the gas export industry,” said Anne Rolfes, founder of the Louisiana Bucket Brigade, an environmental group involved in the litigation. “We’re going to stop it and this is an important step in that process.”

Lyle Hanna, a Commonwealth LNG spokesperson, said that “we are disappointed with the District Court’s decision, and we are exploring all available legal options.”

A spokesperson for the Louisiana Department of Conservation and Energy declined to comment, citing the potential of pending litigation. Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill said that the state planned to appeal.

“Sadly even state court judges are not immune from climate activism,” Murrill said.

Last year, a federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., had ordered the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to reassess Commonwealth LNG’s air pollution, including its greenhouse gas emissions. In June, the commission gave the project a greenlight on the grounds that its construction was in the public interest.

In regulatory filings, the Louisiana Department of Conservation and Energy said that “climate change is currently beyond the scope” of the state’s regulatory review.

But District Judge Penelope Richard rejected this position, saying state environmental regulators have a duty to consider how the LNG facility, along with others clustered nearby, would impact extreme weather events, storm severity and sea-level rise in a state where a football field-worth of land disappears every 100 minutes.

Richard also ordered state regulators to analyze the facility’s impacts on local communities, especially those living in poverty or relying on fishing for their livelihoods — which she noted was the “defining characteristic” of the parish. While the facility could destroy marshes, harm water quality and displace residents, the judge wrote, “none of it was considered in terms of impacts on environmental justice communities.”

Commercial fisherman Eddie LeJuine, a lifelong Cameron Parish resident, applauded the ruling. He said the buildout of LNG infrastructure, including dredging for shipping channels, has significantly harmed the fishing industry.

“The fishermen are barely hanging on with a thread,” LeJuine said. “These plants are killing the estuary and killing our livelihoods. We’re getting extinct.”

In August, a dredging channel being developed by LNG firm Venture Global leaked into a nearby estuary. Local fishermen like LeJuine say the onslaught of saltwater and sediment will kill off large amounts of oyster, crab and fish.

Venture Global, which is in the process of constructing a second LNG export terminal in the parish, said it is “committed to conservation” and is working with state regulators and the community to respond to the incident.

In a letter to President Donald Trump and Department of Energy Secretary Chris Wright, the two-term Democrat urged the administration to oppose terminating federal grants for energy-related projects.
“As Governor of the Commonwealth of Kentucky, my job is to help Kentucky move forward,” Beshear said in the letter.
“I strongly urge your administration to reject DOE’s proposed cuts to these crucial energy projects in Kentucky.
In his letter, Beshear said the project is bringing manufacturing and jobs back to America.","Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear wants to protect the state’s energy projects at risk of losing federal funding.

In a letter to President Donald Trump and Department of Energy Secretary Chris Wright, the two-term Democrat urged the administration to oppose terminating federal grants for energy-related projects.

Cuts could threaten 700 jobs and $537 million of economic development in rural communities and undermine Trump’s attempt to bring jobs back to the U.S., Beshear said in the letter dated Oct. 15.

“As Governor of the Commonwealth of Kentucky, my job is to help Kentucky move forward,” Beshear said in the letter. “I strongly urge your administration to reject DOE’s proposed cuts to these crucial energy projects in Kentucky.

“These cuts will only set back economic development and job opportunities in Kentucky and hurt our country’s international competitiveness and progress on re-shoring domestic manufacturing,” he said.

Kentucky has been the recipient of several recent high-dollar economic development announcements related to clean energy, the electric vehicle supply chain and more through incentives from the legislature and tax credits for consumers passed under former President Joe Biden.

Proposed cuts across the U.S. were outlined in a list reported by several media outlets last week, outlining hundreds of project grants totaling about $24 billion the Trump administration might target.

At the start of October, the Department of Energy terminated 321 financial packages totaling more than $7.5 billion for 223 projects, several of which are on the long list, according to E&E News. About two dozen other grants canceled earlier in the year also appear on the list.

“As Secretary Wright made clear last week, the Department continues to conduct an individualized and thorough review of financial awards made by the previous administration,” said the department’s chief spokesperson Ben Dietderich in an emailed statement to the Herald-Leader last week. His office said it had been unable to verify the list.

The cuts so far this year, and the new list indicating more might be coming, match Trump’s agenda to cancel clean energy programs. His administration has often criticized renewable energy, especially the effort to reduce carbon emissions, as part of a “green energy scam.”

Most of the cuts made earlier this month yanked funding from Democratic states. Members of Congress from those states said in a letter to the department secretary the decision was blatantly partisan and would harm jobs, weaken the grid and give foreign adversaries like China an edge.

The new, longer list includes grant projects in Republican states, too.

Of those projects in Kentucky on the list is a $316 million award for Ascend Elements, Inc. The Massachusetts-based manufacturer announced in October 2022 it would invest $1 billion in its largest electric vehicle battery recycling and manufacturing facility in Hopkinsville creating 400 full-time jobs.

The company’s CEO Linh Austin said last week he’d been notified Oct. 7 the grant had been terminated but any DOE decision regarding grants doesn’t change the company’s trajectory, and it plans to resume construction next spring.

Beshear said the facility will reduce the country’s reliance on battery-related imports from other countries since the U.S. does not produce the critical materials to domestically produce the appropriate amount of batteries to match demand.

Also targeted on the list is a $75 million grant for Diageo, the alcoholic beverage company, which planned to add batteries to its facility in Shelbyville to reduce carbon emissions.

That grant was terminated in May, as was a $72 million one for a carbon capture project at LG&E and KU’s Cane Run Generating Station just outside Louisville. It also appears on the longer list.

The $50 million grant supporting Mitsubishi Electric Corporation as it retrofits a Maysville factory to make high-efficiency heat pumps could also have its funding cut, according to the list.

In his letter, Beshear said the project is bringing manufacturing and jobs back to America. China builds 95% of the heat compressors the factory anticipates producing. At capacity, the facility can make over 1 million each year, Beshear said.

Five projects through the University of Kentucky Research Foundation are on the list and could stand to lose almost $24 million altogether.",https://www.kentucky.com/public/latest-news/tertzo/picture311605398/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/PAD_8192.jpg,N,,2025-10-17 06:03:06.408559

This ruling mandates a thorough state review of the facility’s greenhouse gas emissions and their implications for Gulf Coast communities, which are increasingly vulnerable to the effects of climate change, including sea-level rise and extreme weather events.

The ruling, delivered by a judge from Louisiana’s 38th Judicial District Court, halts any ongoing construction activities for the LNG facility until state regulators can address these pressing environmental and climate justice concerns. This comes in the wake of heightened scrutiny regarding the expansion of liquefied natural gas (LNG) operations in Cameron Parish, an area already home to three of the eight existing LNG export terminals and several others in various stages of approval or construction.

Louisiana’s Attorney General has announced plans to appeal this ruling, which nullified the coastal use permit issued by the Louisiana Department of Conservation and Energy. Environmental groups, including the Sierra Club, have hailed the decision as a significant milestone in their ongoing battle against LNG expansions, emphasizing that this is the first instance where a court has revoked a permit based on climate change considerations.

The discourse around LNG has been polarized, particularly following President Trump’s reversal of a Biden-era pause on LNG exports, aiming to amplify natural gas exports to achieve “energy dominance.” Critics have raised alarms over the potential increase in greenhouse gas emissions exacerbated by what they term “unfettered exports” of LNG, a concern echoed by the previous administration’s Energy Secretary, Jennifer Granholm.

Former Energy Secretary Chris Wright, who was appointed by Trump and has ties to the fossil fuel sector, played a role in expediting LNG facility approvals, including Commonwealth LNG’s, which received its export authorization shortly after Trump took office.

Local environmental advocates have highlighted Cameron Parish as a pivotal battleground for the expansion of the gas export industry, expressing their determination to challenge its growth. They underscored the urgent need for regulatory scrutiny of how such developments strain local ecosystems and threaten communities reliant on fishing and other natural resources for their livelihoods.

In a response to the court’s ruling, a spokesperson for Commonwealth LNG expressed disappointment, indicating that the company is assessing all legal avenues available to contest the decision. Meanwhile, local fishermen have voiced their relief and support for the ruling, pointing out the detrimental impact of LNG infrastructure on their industry.

The ruling also follows a previous federal appeals court mandate requiring the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to reassess Commonwealth LNG’s air pollution impact, including greenhouse gas emissions. Despite initial approval in June based on public interest grounds, the ongoing legal challenges signal a shift in the regulatory landscape.

The court has mandated that regulators not only consider environmental impacts but also the potential risks to local communities, especially those living in poverty or dependent on fishing. Residents, like lifelong Cameron Parish fisherman Eddie LeJuine, have expressed grave concerns that the LNG operations are threatening their way of life and disrupting local ecosystems, evidenced by a recent incident involving a dredging channel leakage that harmed nearby estuaries.

As this legal battle unfolds, it underscores the continuing tension between economic development, energy policies, and environmental justice in Louisiana’s rapidly changing landscape.",https://news.ssbcrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Louisiana-Judge-Vacates-Permit-for-Controversial-LNG-Facility-Citing-Climate.com2F5b2F2c2F16f4c52a96f9f88dccb7cd9117a42F823e6eca7c9742f4badb.jpeg,N,,2025-10-16 23:06:11.442377

“We don’t care about authorship,” Wright told reporters, acknowledging that the AEP loan was conditionally approved by the Biden administration.
When I floated Wright’s comments by Jigar Shah, the former head of the Loan Programs Office under the Biden administration, he was flummoxed.
To Shah, taking Wright’s risk aversion to its logical conclusion would mean, for instance, that the office should not fund any nuclear energy projects.
“The Loan Program Office is being rechristened the Energy Dominant Financing — it is the rechristening of the same department,” he said in response to a question about the office’s remaining loan authority.","Energy Secretary Chris Wright on Thursday announced a $1.6 billion loan guarantee for American Electric Power to replace 5,000 miles of transmission lines with more advanced wires that can carry more electricity. He also hinted at his vision for how the Trump administration could recast the role of the department's Loan Programs Office in the years to come.

The LPO actually announced that it had finalized an agreement, conditionally made in January under the Biden administration, to back AEP’s plan. The loan guarantee will enable AEP to secure lower-cost financing for the project, for an eventual estimated saving to energy consumers of $275 million over the lifetime of the loan.

“These are the kind of projects where we’re going to partner with businesses to make our energy system more efficient, more reliable, ultimately lower cost,” Wright said on a call with reporters.

And yet in the past few months, the department has also canceled loan guarantees and grants for other transmission projects that were expected to provide those same benefits — including the Grain Belt Express, an 800-mile line set to bring low-cost wind power from Kansas to the Chicago metropolitan area in Illinois.

“We don’t care about authorship,” Wright told reporters, acknowledging that the AEP loan was conditionally approved by the Biden administration. “Not all of them were nonsense. The ones that are in the interest of the American taxpayers, in the interest of the American ratepayers, and there’s a helpful role for government capital — we’re happy to support those.”

When asked specifically why AEP’s proposal met his criteria while the Grain Belt Express didn’t, Wright first made an argument about cost. “I have nothing against the Grain Belt Express,” he said. “I suspect it’ll still be developed. But it’s far more expensive on a per mile basis since it’s a brand new transmission line.”

His subsequent comments, however, hinted at a more significant shift in approach. He went on to argue that the project came with an unacceptable amount of risk since the developers didn’t have buyers yet for the power coming down the line. It was trying to “close on arbitrage,” he said, by buying up cheap wind power that was stranded in Kansas and bringing it to a larger market. “It’s a more commercial enterprise,” he said. “That’s done with private entrepreneurs and private capital.”

It’s important to note that the Grain Belt Express loan guarantee would have been issued under an innovation-focused program within the Loan Programs Office that was specifically geared toward higher risk projects that banks won’t otherwise touch. The AEP project is part of a different program focused on more mature technologies, with a goal of reducing the cost of major utility infrastructure upgrades to ratepayers.

When I floated Wright’s comments by Jigar Shah, the former head of the Loan Programs Office under the Biden administration, he was flummoxed. “It’s nonsensical,” he said. To Shah, taking Wright’s risk aversion to its logical conclusion would mean, for instance, that the office should not fund any nuclear energy projects. “If this becomes a new standard, that means nuclear is dead in the United States,” he said.

AEP is the first developer to secure a loan guarantee under the Energy Dominance Financing Program, Congress’ new name a Biden-era program within LPO that offered loan guarantees to utilities to “retool, repower, repurpose, or replace energy infrastructure.” Initially called the Energy Infrastructure Reinvestment Financing Program and created by the Inflation Reduction Act, it focused on projects with climate benefits, like making efficiency upgrades to power plants or installing renewables on the site of a former coal plant.

In the Biden administration’s view, AEP’s project would “contribute to emissions reductions by supporting existing and new clean generation by expanding transmission capacity in the regions in which they operate.”

Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act rebranded the program and removed any requirements that projects reduce emissions. On Thursday’s call, Wright seemed to imply that it wasn’t just the Biden-era loan program that had been renamed. “The Loan Program Office is being rechristened the Energy Dominant Financing — it is the rechristening of the same department,” he said in response to a question about the office’s remaining loan authority. The Department of Energy did not respond to my request for clarification.

None of that means that the potential emissions benefits from AEP’s project won’t materialize. Limited transmission capacity is one of the biggest obstacles for bringing new wind and solar power online, and reconductoring could also reduce line losses, making the overall grid more efficient.

The transmission project — which includes plans to rebuild some power lines and reconductor others — will ultimately increase capacity by more than 100%, a spokesperson for AEP told me. The first phase will involve upgrades to about 100 miles of wires across Ohio and Oklahoma, while future phases will tackle lines in Indiana, Michigan, and West Virginia, with the intent of meeting growing demand from data centers and manufacturing development, according to a press release.

When reporters asked Wright about the other conditional loan guarantees the Biden administration had issued under the Energy Infrastructure Reinvestment program that are still pending, the secretary stressed that he was looking for applicants that had identified a clear set of projects they would implement. “Many were done in a hurry, without really even having the projects that the loans would be associated with identified. You can end up with a grab bag of projects without a lot of say for where the money went,” he said.

Wright accused the Biden administration of failing to ask applicants to detail the impact the projects would have on taxpayers and ratepayers — a key question his colleagues are now asking.

Shah disagreed with that portrayal. The whole point of the program was to reduce interest rates for utilities and require them to pass on the benefit to ratepayers. All of the projects awarded conditional commitments met that bar, he said.

He warned that if the Trump administration didn’t honor the remaining conditional commitments to utilities under the program — all 10 of them — it risked losing the trust of any new companies it attempts to make similar deals with.

“Most of the nuclear projects that they’re looking to chase are not going to get closed until 2028. And so what signal are they sending?

Last week, a judge from Louisiana’s 38th Judicial District Court effectively halted construction of Commonwealth LNG by ordering state regulators to analyze the facility’s climate change and environmental justice-related impacts, in conjunction with the broader LNG buildout in southwest Louisiana’s Cameron Parish.

Three of the nation’s eight existing LNG export terminals are located in Cameron Parish, and several more are proposed or under construction.

Louisiana’s attorney general vowed to appeal the ruling, which vacated the Louisiana Department of Conservation and Energy’s coastal use permit for the facility.

“This is the first time any court has vacated a permit for an LNG facility based on the government’s refusal to consider climate change impacts,” said Clay Garside, an attorney representing the Sierra Club and other environmental groups.

Earlier this year, Trump reversed a Biden-era pause on exports of liquefied natural gas, or LNG, as part of his goal to boost natural gas exports and promote “energy dominance.”

Last year, the Biden administration’s Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm’s hard warned that “unfettered exports” of liquefied natural gas would increase planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions — a statement reflecting the findings of a Department of Energy report released in December.

Trump-appointed Energy Secretary Chris Wright, a fossil fuel executive, has moved to fast-track the buildout of LNG facilities, including Commonwealth LNG, which received an export authorization within weeks of Trump’s inauguration.

“Cameron Parish is ground zero for the relentless expansion of the gas export industry,” said Anne Rolfes, founder of the Louisiana Bucket Brigade, an environmental group involved in the litigation. “We’re going to stop it and this is an important step in that process.”

Lyle Hanna, a Commonwealth LNG spokesperson, said that “we are disappointed with the District Court’s decision, and we are exploring all available legal options.”

A spokesperson for the Louisiana Department of Conservation and Energy declined to comment, citing the potential of pending litigation. Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill said that the state planned to appeal.

“Sadly even state court judges are not immune from climate activism,” Murrill said.

Last year, a federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., had ordered the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to re-assess Commonwealth LNG’s air pollution, including its greenhouse gas emissions. In June, the commission gave the project a greenlight on the grounds that its construction was in the public interest.

In regulatory filings, the Louisiana Department of Conservation and Energy said that “climate change is currently beyond the scope of this review.”

But District Judge Penelope Richard rejected this position, saying state environmental regulators have a duty to consider how the LNG facility, along with others clustered nearby, would impact extreme weather events, storm severity and sea-level rise in a state where a football field-worth of land disappears every 100 minutes.

Richard also ordered state regulators to analyze the facility’s impacts on local communities, especially those living in poverty or relying on fishing for their livelihoods — which she noted was the “defining characteristic” of the parish. While the facility could destroy marshes, harm water quality and displace residents, the judge wrote, “none of it was considered in terms of impacts on environmental justice communities.”

Commercial fisherman Eddie LeJuine, a lifelong Cameron Parish resident, applauded the ruling. He said the buildout of LNG infrastructure, including dredging for shipping channels, has significantly harmed the fishing industry.

“The fishermen are barely hanging on with a thread,” LeJuine said. “These plants are killing the estuary and killing our livelihoods. We’re getting extinct.”

In August, a dredging channel being developed by LNG firm Venture Global leaked into a nearby estuary. Local fishermen like LeJuine say the onslaught of saltwater and sediment will kill off large amounts of oyster, crab and fish.

Venture Global, which is in the process of constructing a second LNG export terminal in the parish, said it is “committed to conservation” and is working with state regulators and the community to respond to the incident.

“Without more energy and without more reliable energy, America will face an energy disaster with affordability and reliability issues unlike anything we’ve experienced since the advent of electricity,” he said.
“As we improve our grid, we are committed to loading it with record supplies of reliable energy, including coal, nuclear and natural gas.
Haustveit said Energy Department leadership team has identified 16 potential sites at national labs and other DOE-owned land for AI data center development.
Make no mistake, the prior administration’s war on coal and neglect of nuclear energy are over,” he said.","(The Center Square) – The U.S. will need more reliable energy sources than ever before and the Trump administration will deliver, an assistant secretary at the U.S. Department of Energy said at a summit Thursday.

The Louisiana Energy Security Summit 2025 in New Orleans featured U.S. Sen. Bill Cassidy along with keynote speaker Kyle Haustveit and brought 70 thought leaders from around the country to discuss the state’s role in advancing U.S. energy dominance in the face of evolving global challenges.

“The president and our administration are determined to unleash greater energy production than ever before, utilizing every reliable energy source at our disposal,” said Haustveit, assistant secretary for Fossil Energy Department Management in the U.S. Department of Energy.

“And as we do this, we will unleash unparalleled prosperity across our nation, including this region,” said Haustveit, who addressed the summit by video because of the federal government shutdown.

Haustveit oversees Fossil Energy and National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) programs and manages a $5 billion research development portfolio that includes coal, oil, natural gas and critical minerals with the objective of advancing affordable and reliable energy solutions, according to the Department of Energy.

Haustveit said the previous administration pursued an anti-energy policy. “It restrained both energy production and the building of energy infrastructure such as natural gas pipelines.”

America needs both more energy and more energy diversity, said Haustveit, a North Dakota native whose family has worked in the energy industry for three generations.

“Thanks to the accelerating march of innovation and progress, including the president’s manufacturing revival and the coming rise in AI data center growth, a tidal wave of energy demand is headed our way and is about to wash over this nation and indeed the world,” Haustveit said.

Haustveit said the Energy Department’s Florence Berkeley National Lab estimated last year that data center demand for energy will double or triple by 2028. “The kind of energy we will need for these data centers will be rock solid energy that delivers 24-7 reliability. In other words, if we want to power these data centers and reindustrialize our country, we not only need more energy supply, we also need more energy diversity.,” said Haustveit.

“The United States needs to develop the most reliable energy sources on the planet, including coal and nuclear, oil and natural gas,” said Haustveit. “Without more energy and without more reliable energy, America will face an energy disaster with affordability and reliability issues unlike anything we’ve experienced since the advent of electricity,” he said.

Haustveit said Secretary of Energy Chris Wright has responded to the crisis by issuing eight emergency orders pursuant to Section 202c of the Federal Powers Act that have strengthened grid reliability during peak demand to prevent power outages and saved consumers at least $4.7 million in energy costs.

“We’re looking for stakeholder input on how best to utilize our funding programs and authorities to rapidly expand energy generation and transmission grid capacity,” the assistant secretary said. “As we improve our grid, we are committed to loading it with record supplies of reliable energy, including coal, nuclear and natural gas. Given the AI revolution alone and the coming surge in consumption, there is clearly no alternative to the pro energy course we are taking,” said Haustveit.

Haustveit said Energy Department leadership team has identified 16 potential sites at national labs and other DOE-owned land for AI data center development.

“We support removing regulations that constrain AI development, and we are unleashing DOE resources and the innovation of our national labs to ensure we have the resources to power the AI revolution. But again, none of this can be sustained without an unprecedented surge in energy supply,” said Haustveit.

Haustveit said the department is laser focused on fulfilling the president’s mandates on nuclear energy. He said the focus is on enabling the rapid deployment and export of next generation nuclear technology, bringing down operating costs for existing reactors, expanding the application of nuclear energy beyond electricity to support manufacturing and industry, strengthening nuclear fuel infrastructure, restarting reactors that were prematurely closed, and cutting regulations that have stifled the industry.

“Streamlining the permitting process will ensure nuclear developers get steel in the ground faster,” Hustveit said. “As vice chair of the new National Energy Dominance Council, Secretary Wright is working closely with the chair, Interior Secretary [Doug] Burgum, and other council members to unleash American energy through permitting reform. Make no mistake, the prior administration’s war on coal and neglect of nuclear energy are over,” he said.

Haustveit said the administration will also “unleash” another base load resource, natural gas.

“We are on the cusp of an LNG revolution that will fill the world with our LNG bounty. Several of the LNG export authorizations processed during the first Trump administration have now become actual exports, including the Plaquemines LNG project right here in Louisiana that has just come online,” said Haustveit.

(AP) — U.S. officials rejected a mining company’s bid for more than 6 million tons of coal beneath a national forest in Utah, marking the third proposed coal sale from public lands in the West to fall through this month, the Interior Department disclosed Thursday.

The failed sales mark a setback in Republican President Donald Trump’s push to revive a coal mining industry that’s been in decline for almost two decades. Emissions from burning coal are a leading driver of climate change that’s raising sea levels and making weather more extreme.

The Interior Department rejected the sole bid it received for two tracts of federal coal on the Manti-La Sal National Forest because it did not meet the requirements of the Mineral Leasing Act, agency spokesperson Alyse Sharpe said.

The leasing act requires companies to pay fair market value for coal mined on public lands. Sharpe declined to say how much was bid.

The coal tracts near central Utah’s Skyline Mine were requested by a subsidiary of Wolverine Fuels LLC, which operates Skyline and two other active coal mines in the area, employing 950 people, according to its website. The Associated Press left voicemails and electronic messages seeking comment from the company.

The Interior Department’s Bureau of Land Management offered a lease on one tract, with 1.3 million tons of coal, during an Oct. 1 competitive sale. The other tract, with 5 million tons of coal, was a proposed expansion of an existing lease held. The rejected bid covered both tracts, Sharpe said.

Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said two weeks ago that the government will open 13 million acres of federal lands for coal mining. But it’s unclear who would want that fuel as utilities turn to cheaper natural gas and renewables such as wind and solar to generate electricity.

On Oct. 6, a coal sale from public lands in Montana that would have been the largest by the government in more than a decade drew a single bid of $186,000, or about one-tenth of a penny per ton of coal, and was later rejected. That lease held 167 million tons of coal in southeastern Montana near the Navajo Transition Energy Co.’s Spring Creek mine.

Two days later the Interior Department postponed an even bigger sale — 440 million tons next to the Navajo Nation-owned company’s Antelope Mine in Wyoming.

Sharpe repeated the Trump administration’s assertion that the policies of former Presidents Joe Biden and Barack Obama were to blame for the failed sales, saying they tried “to dismantle domestic production and shake investor confidence in the industry.”

Both Democrats attempted to curb sales of coal from public lands, only to have those policies reversed by Trump.

Three other coal lease sales from public lands were successful under Trump. The largest, in Alabama, involved 54 million tons of higher quality coal used in steelmaking that Warrior Met Coal Mining bought for $46 million, or about 87 cents per ton. Two recent sales in North Dakota of leases containing a combined 30 million tons of coal brought in $186,000 total, or less than a penny per ton.

“As demand for reliable, dispatchable power grows, coal remains a critical component of ensuring affordable and dependable energy for the American people,” Sharpe said in a statement.

Industry analysts and economists say the biggest driver of coal’s retreat has been market forces that make other energy sources more economical. Many coal plants served by large mines on public lands in the West are nearing retirement.

Environmentalists fought for years against the expansion of Utah’s Skyline Mine. Emma Yip with the Center for Biological Diversity described the bid rejection as “yet another face-plant for the Trump administration” as it tries to prop up a dying industry.

“Coal is among the dirtiest energy sources on Earth and burning it continues to sicken and kill Americans. There’s no defensible reason to keep it on life support when absolutely nobody wants it,” Yip said.

Shrinking coal demand in the U.S. has prompted mining companies to seek out customers overseas, including in Asia where consumption has continued to rise. Wolverine Fuels, Warrior Met Coal Mining and Navajo Transitional Energy Co. export some of their coal.

Energy Secretary Chris Wright said during a Thursday conference call with reporters that coal remains the largest source of electricity globally and predicted that U.S. exports of the fuel would increase. Prior efforts to boost exports were hobbled by a lack of U.S. port capacity.

Arizona’s attorney general, Kris Mayes, said the cancellation of the program would affect 900,000 low-income households nationwide.
A second suit will seek reinstatement of the program and is expected to be filed later on Thursday in federal court in Washington state, Bonta’s statement said.
“The Trump administration is trying to hold us in the past, tethered to fossil fuel companies,” he said in the online call.
The complaints come 10 days after a group of solar companies and labor unions also sued to restore the program.","Nearly two dozen states are suing the Trump administration over its cancellation of a $7bn grant program aimed at expanding solar energy in low-income communities, according to court papers.

In a statement on Thursday, California’s attorney general, Rob Bonta, announced two lawsuits by a group of states that received grants under the Environmental Protection Agency’s Solar for All program. The EPA’s administrator, Lee Zeldin, announced the termination of the program in August. The agency said in an email that it would not comment on pending litigation.

Arizona’s attorney general, Kris Mayes, said the cancellation of the program would affect 900,000 low-income households nationwide. Some 11,000 low-income households in Arizona will see a 20% spike in energy bills after the state lost $156m for Solar for All.

The lawsuit is among dozens the country’s 23 Democratic attorneys general have filed against the Trump administration on issues ranging from suspension of federal grants to immigration and deployment of national guard troops to cities. “Without this program, for many Arizonans, clean energy will be out of reach,” Mayes said in an online call.

The first complaint seeks monetary damages and was filed on Wednesday in the court of federal claims. A second suit will seek reinstatement of the program and is expected to be filed later on Thursday in federal court in Washington state, Bonta’s statement said.

California will lose around $250m in congressionally obligated funds for the program, Bonta said.

“The Trump administration is trying to hold us in the past, tethered to fossil fuel companies,” he said in the online call. “In doing so, Trump is making America more expensive and more polluted.” The One Big Beautiful Bill Act signed into law by Donald Trump in July eliminated the source of funding for a program Zeldin termed a “boondoggle”. The president has rolled back federal support for solar and wind energy, calling the renewable resources expensive and unreliable.

Mayes said the program’s cancellation would hit disadvantaged communities, citing the Hopi tribe of northern Arizona, which was slated to get a $25m award to bring electricity, often for the first time, to hundreds of homes using solar panels and battery storage systems.

The complaints come 10 days after a group of solar companies and labor unions also sued to restore the program.

In addition to California and Arizona, states participating in the lawsuits include Maryland, Colorado, Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Kentucky, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and Wisconsin, and the city of Washington DC.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/75bbc39da9582cc247cabe50c239037b3152ebc4/891_0_4453_3563/master/4453.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=3c49e1a8f7fc667d3f7231f5464312e7",N,,2025-10-16 20:07:40.101028

Electric utilities that receive loans through the program must provide assurances to the government that financial benefits from the financing will be passed on to customers, the Energy Department said.
Wright, in a conference call with reporters, distinguished the AEP loan guarantee from a $4.9 billion federal loan guarantee the department cancelled in July.
The loan guarantee to AEP was among those conditionally approved under Biden, a fact Wright acknowledged to reporters.","WASHINGTON (AP) — The Department of Energy said Thursday it has finalized a $1.6 billion loan guarantee to a subsidiary of one of the nation’s largest power companies to upgrade nearly 5,000 miles of transmission lines across five states, mostly in the Midwest, for largely fossil fuel-run energy.

AEP Transmission will upgrade power lines in Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Oklahoma and West Virginia to enhance enhance grid reliability and capacity, the Energy Department said. The project, first offered under the Biden administration, is meant to help meet surging electricity demand from data centers and artificial intelligence.

Ohio-based American Electric Power, which owns AEP Transmission, is one of the nation’s largest utilities, serving 5.6 million customers in 11 states. It primarily produces electricity from coal, natural gas and nuclear power, along with renewable resources such as wind and hydroelectric power.

Thursday’s announcement deepens the Trump administration’s commitment to traditional, polluting energy sources even as it works to discourage the U.S. from clean energy use.

Earlier this month, the administration cancelled $7.6 billion in grants that supported hundreds of clean energy projects in 16 states, all of which voted for Democrat Kamala Harris in last year’s presidential election. A total of 223 projects were terminated after a review determined they did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs or were not economically viable, the Energy Department said.

The cancellations include up to $1.2 billion for California’s hydrogen hub aimed at developing clean-burning hydrogen fuels to power ships and heavy-duty trucks. A hydrogen project costing up to $1 billion in the Pacific Northwest also was cancelled.

The loan guarantee finalized Thursday is the first offered by the Trump administration under the recently renamed Energy Dominance Financing program created by the massive tax-and-spending law approved this summer by congressional Republicans and signed by President Donald Trump. Electric utilities that receive loans through the program must provide assurances to the government that financial benefits from the financing will be passed on to customers, the Energy Department said.

The project and others being considered will help ensure that Americans “will have access to affordable, reliable and secure energy for decades to come,” Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in a statement.

“The president has been clear: America must reverse course from the energy subtraction agenda of past administrations and strengthen our electrical grid,” Wright said, adding that modernizing the grid and expanding transmission capacity “will help position the United States to win the AI race and grow our manufacturing base.”

The upgrades supported by the federal financing will replace existing transmission lines in existing rights-of-way with new lines capable of carrying more energy, the power company said.

More than 2,000 miles of transmission lines in Ohio serving 1.5 million people will be replaced, along with more than 1,400 miles in Indiana and Michigan serving 600,000 customers, the company said. An additional 1,400 miles in Oklahoma, serving about 1.2 million people and 26 miles in West Virginia, serving 460,000 people, will be replaced.

The projects will create about 1,100 construction jobs, the company said.

The loan guarantee will save customers money and improve reliability while supporting economic growth in the five states, said Bill Fehrman, AEP’s chairman, president and chief executive officer. “The funds we will save through this program enable us to make additional investments to enhance service for our customers,” he added.

Wright, in a conference call with reporters, distinguished the AEP loan guarantee from a $4.9 billion federal loan guarantee the department cancelled in July. That money would have boosted the planned Grain Belt Express, a new high-voltage transmission line set to deliver solar and wind-generated electricity from the Midwest to eastern states.

The Energy Department said at the time it was “not critical for the federal government to have a role” in the first phase of the $11 billion project planned by Chicago-based Invenergy. The department also questioned whether the project could meet strict financial conditions required, a claim Wright repeated Thursday.

“Ultimately that is a commercial enterprise that needs private developers,” Wright said. The company has indicated the Grain Belt project will go forward.

Trump and Wright have repeatedly derided wind and solar energy as unreliable and opposed efforts to combat climate change by moving away from fossil fuels. Wright said the Grain Belt Express loan was among billions of dollars worth of commitments “rushed out the door” in the waning days of former President Joe Biden’s administration.

The loan guarantee to AEP was among those conditionally approved under Biden, a fact Wright acknowledged to reporters.

“Not all of the (Biden-era) projects were nonsense,” he said, adding that he was “happy to move forward” with the transmission upgrade.",https://www.cbs17.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/29/2025/10/68f1596aaf5964.37025027.jpeg?w=1280,N,,2025-10-16 20:11:52.030925

Haustveit oversees Fossil Energy and National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) programs and manages a $5 billion research development portfolio that includes coal, oil, natural gas and critical minerals with the objective of advancing affordable and reliable energy solutions, according to the Department of Energy.
“Without more energy and without more reliable energy, America will face an energy disaster with affordability and reliability issues unlike anything we’ve experienced since the advent of electricity,” he said.
“As we improve our grid, we are committed to loading it with record supplies of reliable energy, including coal, nuclear and natural gas.
Make no mistake, the prior administration’s war on coal and neglect of nuclear energy are over,” he said.","(The Center Square) – The U.S. will need more reliable energy sources than ever before and the Trump administration will deliver, an assistant secretary at the U.S. Department of Energy said at a summit Thursday.

The Louisiana Energy Security Summit 2025 in New Orleans featured U.S. Sen. Bill Cassidy along with keynote speaker Kyle Haustveit and brought 70 thought leaders from around the country to discuss the state’s role in advancing U.S. energy dominance in the face of evolving global challenges.

“The president and our administration are determined to unleash greater energy production than ever before, utilizing every reliable energy source at our disposal,” said Haustveit, assistant secretary for Fossil Energy Department Management in the U.S. Department of Energy.

“And as we do this, we will unleash unparalleled prosperity across our nation, including this region,” said Haustveit, who addressed the summit by video because of the federal government shutdown.

Haustveit oversees Fossil Energy and National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) programs and manages a $5 billion research development portfolio that includes coal, oil, natural gas and critical minerals with the objective of advancing affordable and reliable energy solutions, according to the Department of Energy.

Haustveit said the previous administration pursued an anti-energy policy. “It restrained both energy production and the building of energy infrastructure such as natural gas pipelines.”

America needs both more energy and more energy diversity, said Haustveit, a North Dakota native whose family has worked in the energy industry for three generations.

“Thanks to the accelerating march of innovation and progress, including the president’s manufacturing revival and the coming rise in AI data center growth, a tidal wave of energy demand is headed our way and is about to wash over this nation and indeed the world,” Haustveit said.

Haustveit said the Energy Department’s Florence Berkeley National Lab estimated last year that data center demand for energy will double or triple by 2028. “The kind of energy we will need for these data centers will be rock solid energy that delivers 24-7 reliability. In other words, if we want to power these data centers and reindustrialize our country, we not only need more energy supply, we also need more energy diversity.,” said Haustveit.

“The United States needs to develop the most reliable energy sources on the planet, including coal and nuclear, oil and natural gas,” said Haustveit. “Without more energy and without more reliable energy, America will face an energy disaster with affordability and reliability issues unlike anything we’ve experienced since the advent of electricity,” he said.

Haustveit said Secretary of Energy Chris Wright has responded to the crisis by issuing eight emergency orders pursuant to Section 202c of the Federal Powers Act that have strengthened grid reliability during peak demand to prevent power outages and saved consumers at least $4.7 million in energy costs.

“We’re looking for stakeholder input on how best to utilize our funding programs and authorities to rapidly expand energy generation and transmission grid capacity,” the assistant secretary said. “As we improve our grid, we are committed to loading it with record supplies of reliable energy, including coal, nuclear and natural gas. Given the AI revolution alone and the coming surge in consumption, there is clearly no alternative to the pro energy course we are taking,” said Haustveit.

Haustveit said Energy Department leadership team has identified 16 potential sites at national labs and other DOE-owned land for AI data center development.

“We support removing regulations that constrain AI development, and we are unleashing DOE resources and the innovation of our national labs to ensure we have the resources to power the AI revolution. But again, none of this can be sustained without an unprecedented surge in energy supply,” said Haustveit.

Haustveit said the department is laser focused on fulfilling the president’s mandates on nuclear energy. He said the focus is on enabling the rapid deployment and export of next generation nuclear technology, bringing down operating costs for existing reactors, expanding the application of nuclear energy beyond electricity to support manufacturing and industry, strengthening nuclear fuel infrastructure, restarting reactors that were prematurely closed, and cutting regulations that have stifled the industry.

“Streamlining the permitting process will ensure nuclear developers get steel in the ground faster,” Hustveit said. “As vice chair of the new National Energy Dominance Council, Secretary Wright is working closely with the chair, Interior Secretary [Doug] Burgum, and other council members to unleash American energy through permitting reform. Make no mistake, the prior administration’s war on coal and neglect of nuclear energy are over,” he said.

Haustveit said the administration will also “unleash” another base load resource, natural gas.

“We are on the cusp of an LNG revolution that will fill the world with our LNG bounty.

In North Carolina, the program is administered by the state Department of Environmental Quality, which calls its version EnergizeNC.
North Carolina applied for $250 million in grants and in 2024 received more than $156 million to be used over five years.
The money also would have helped support the burgeoning solar power industry in the state, whose more than 200 businesses have more than 9,000 employees.
“Thousands of families were going to have the option to install solar power, save money, and have another energy option after a major storm.","North Carolina and 22 other states sued President Donald Trump’s Environmental Protection Agency Thursday, claiming it had illegally canceled more than $7 billion in grants meant to help install solar power in low-income and rural areas.

N.C. Attorney General Jeff Jackson joined the suit on behalf of the state, which had secured $150 million in grants through the Solar for All program when Trump’s EPA chief announced the funding would be canceled. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin made the announcement in a social media post in August in which he called Solar for All “a boondoggle.”

Solar for All is an initiative of the Biden administration’s “Investing in America” agenda and was funded by Congress through the Inflation Reduction Act, which created EPA’s $27 billion Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund.

Clean-energy advocates have long said the United States must reduce its reliance on fossil fuels to slow climate change, reduce carbon emissions and lower energy costs. Solar power with battery storage is one of the cleanest and least polluting sources of energy.

A solar collection system can be designed and installed in a few months on sunny rooftops, exterior walls and open spaces. Large, centralized power plants that rely on coal, gas or nuclear power can take years to build or expand.

While rooftop solar can save a family or business money over the long run, up-front installation costs can be a deterrent. That’s where Solar for All was designed to help, by giving grants to states, territories, tribal governments, municipalities and nonprofits across the country. In North Carolina, the program is administered by the state Department of Environmental Quality, which calls its version EnergizeNC.

A coalition including the NC Clean Energy Technology Center at N.C. State University, the NC Clean Energy Fund, and Advanced Energy has been working with DEQ to determine how best to use the money.

North Carolina applied for $250 million in grants and in 2024 received more than $156 million to be used over five years. Some of that had been drawn down when Zeldin announced the cancellation of the program. Those working with EnergizeNC said the money would have helped more than 12,000 households in the state save an average of 20% on their utility bills. The money also would have helped support the burgeoning solar power industry in the state, whose more than 200 businesses have more than 9,000 employees.

“These funds were going to help low-income and rural North Carolinians save money on their energy bills,” Jackson said in a press release. “Thousands of families were going to have the option to install solar power, save money, and have another energy option after a major storm. Now the EPA has illegally cancelled those funds — so I’m going to court to bring $150 million back to our state.”

Reid Wilson, secretary of NCDEQ, said, “Rooftop solar drives down utility bills, reduces air pollution and creates jobs. The program’s cancellation would hurt the electric grid’s ability to be resilient to future disasters, and would hamper North Carolina’s efforts to ensure reliable, clean and affordable energy supplies to meet the needs of a rapidly growing population and rising energy demand.”

Jackson said the EPA unilaterally cancelled all grant agreements in the program, leaving North Carolina without more than $150 million of the $156 million it had been awarded. He said the EPA notified all recipients, including North Carolina, that there was no longer any “statutory basis or dedicated funding” for Solar for All, though the cancellation was not approved by Congress, which had approved the original funding.

“In fact,” Jackson said, “Congress did the opposite by only rescinding unawarded Solar for All funds when it passed the BBB (Big Beautiful Bill). The grants were abruptly cancelled without a valid legal basis, and the attorneys general are suing to win back this money that is legally due to North Carolina and other states.”

Jackson and the other states filed the complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington. The suit claims the EPA violated the Administrative Procedure Act and the U.S. Constitution’s Separation of Powers Doctrine by unlawfully canceling Solar for All.

Jackson also joined states in a second lawsuit in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims arguing that EPA breached the clear terms of the agreements and violated the duty of good faith and fair dealing in canceling their Solar for All grants.",https://www.newsobserver.com/public/latest-news/cd68s8/picture312532595/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/ncsu%20clean%20energy%20technology%20center.jpg,N,,2025-10-16 20:11:58.581638

The proposed amendment will be subject to the passing of a Ministerial Order.","Vehicle registration tax & benefit in kind

The Bill includes measures to implement this year’s Budget announcements to extend the vehicle registration tax (VRT) relief and benefit in kind (BIK) relief for electric vehicles.

It is proposed that the VRT relief will be extended to 31 December 2026 and the BIK relief for cars and vans will be extended to 31 December 2028, although the additional discount to original market value (OMV) for BIK purposes will taper down from €10,000 in the 2026 tax year to €5,000 in the 2027 tax year, and to €2,500 in the 2028 tax year.

The Bill also proposes to introduce a new vehicle category A1 for zero carbon emission cars and this new category of cars will attract a lower BIK cost of between 6 and 15 percent of the OMV of the car depending on the business mileage in the year.

Energy efficient equipment & capital allowances

As announced by the minister in his Budget speech, it is proposed that the schemes for accelerated capital allowances available in respect of certain energy efficient equipment, gas and hydrogen vehicles used for the purposes of carrying on a trade will be extended to 31 December 2030.

This is very much in alignment with the EU Clean Industrial Deal which has promoted the use of accelerated capital allowances and tax credits to incentivise investment into energy efficient and green energy expenditure.

Interest limitation rules – exemption for certain large scale assets

In an unexpected move, it is proposed that the scope of the current exemption from the interest limitation regime which applies to providing, upgrading, operating or maintaining certain large scale assets (such as renewable energy installations, strategic housing developments and public-private partnership (PPP) roads) where relevant conditions are met will be extended to include electricity transmission infrastructure developments, strategic gas infrastructure developments, strategic infrastructure developments and large-scale residential developments, as defined in the Planning and Development Act 2024 where a decision to grant permission for that development has been made under that Act.

This encompasses a broad range of infrastructure assets such as transmission lines, substations and switching stations, electricity interconnectors, downstream gas pipelines, surface storage of natural gas, natural gas terminals, waste-water treatment plants, waste incinerators, certain harbour and port installations, thermal power stations and certain healthcare infrastructure.

This is a welcome development and will give investors and developers of these projects more certainty regarding the tax treatment of their financing costs. The proposed amendment will be subject to the passing of a Ministerial Order.",https://kpmg.com/content/dam/kpmgsites/ie/images/insights/tax/ie-finance-bill-2025-green-transition.jpg,N,,2025-10-16 23:05:31.810279

Dubbed the FastSites program, the initiative is backed by $150 million from a Site Investment and Infrastructure Fund state lawmakers approved earlier this year, according to the Louisiana Economic Development agency.

FastSites relies on participation from local governments, nonprofit groups, development authorities and private landowners who can apply and compete for the funding. The allocations from the fund will be structured as forgivable loans or a partnership deal with the state.

The money can be used to purchase tracts of land and partially develop it by, for example, demolishing old buildings, clearing trees, providing road and rail access or upgrading utility connections to the site.

“This is one of the most forward-thinking site development models in the country,” LED Chief Economic Competitiveness Officer Ileana Ledet said in a news release. “FastSites aligns government efficiency with private-sector speed, ensuring Louisiana can meet the demands of global investment while strengthening our communities and infrastructure.”

The funding awards will range from a minimum of $1 million to as much as $25 million. Applicants must match the funding by as much as 50% to 80%, depending on the project type. Private landowners who qualify for the funding will have higher matching requirements and won’t be eligible for future loan forgiveness, according to LED.

Städer kämpar med översvämningar, nationalparker förlorar glaciärer och djurlivsmiljöer, stränder eroderar och den arktiska vildmarken är hotad. Dessa effekter omformar ekosystem, äventyrar samhällen och hotar både naturliga och kulturella landmärken, vilket gör det tydligt att klimatförändringarna inte längre är en avlägsen oro utan en aktuell verklighet i hela landet.

Över hela USA brottas några av landets mest kända destinationer med de eskalerande effekterna av klimatförändringarna. Från dynamiska kuststäder till hisnande nationalparker omdefinierar stigande havsnivåer, extremt väder och miljöförstöring landskapen, försörjningsmöjligheterna och kulturskatterna i dessa regioner.

Miami, Florida, känt för sitt energiska nattliv, solkyssta stränder och mångfaldiga samhällen, står inför ett alltmer akut hot. Prognoser tyder på att havsnivåerna kan stiga med så mycket som 1,8 meter fram till år 2100, vilket potentiellt kan översvämma stora delar av staden. Även idag orsakar högvatten ""soliga dagsöversvämningar"", vilket tillfälligt förvandlar gator till vattenvägar. Trots pågående investeringar i infrastrukturförbättringar är Miamis framtid fortfarande osäker, och stadens ekonomi och kulturella vitalitet hänger i en våg om inte djärva klimatåtgärder vidtas.

New Orleans, Louisiana, står inför en förvärrad utmaning med sjunkande land och återkommande kraftiga stormar. Vissa områden i staden fortsätter att sjunka i alarmerande takt, vilket gör stadsdelar alltmer utsatta för översvämningar och orkaner. Även om översvämningsskydd har förstärkts tidigare, är stadens distinkta kulturella identitet – inklusive dess musik, mat och traditioner – fortfarande i fara. New Orleans exemplifierar sårbarheten hos låglänta stadscentra i en varmare värld.

I norra Klippiga bergen upplever Montanas Glacier National Park ett snabbt försvinnande av sina namngivna glaciärer. Mer än 80 % av parkens glaciärer har smält sedan slutet av 1800-talet, och experter varnar för att den återstående isen kan försvinna inom det kommande decenniet. Denna reträtt påverkar flodsystem, djurlivsmiljöer och parkens ikoniska vyer, vilket utmanar bevarandeinsatser och hotar den ekologiska balansen som lockar miljontals besökare varje år.

På östkusten kämpar Cape Hatteras i North Carolina med obeveklig erosion längs kusterna. Vissa sträckor av kusten förlorar upp till 15 meter sand årligen, vilket äventyrar både stränder och historiska landmärken. Även om strandrestaureringsprojekt har gett tillfällig lindring är den långsiktiga livskraften för denna pittoreska kustlinje osäker i takt med att havsnivåerna stiger och stormarna intensifieras.

San Francisco, Kalifornien, står inför överlappande hot från stigande tidvatten och jordbävningar. Låglänta områden och kustområden förväntas översvämmas under högvatten i mitten av århundradet, samtidigt som den ständigt närvarande risken för en större seismisk händelse tornar upp sig. Stadens unika karaktär, ikoniska landmärken och ekonomiska vitalitet utmanas alla av dessa sammanhängande hot, trots pågående åtgärder för att motstå motståndskraft.

Florida Keys, en kedja av tropiska öar, är alltmer sårbara för stigande havsnivåer och starkare orkaner. Dessa förändringar hotar både öarnas naturliga ekosystem och lokala ekonomier, som är starkt beroende av turism och fiske. Studier tyder på att betydande delar av Keys kan vara under vatten år 2040, vilket understryker det akuta behovet av proaktiva anpassningsstrategier.

Yellowstone nationalpark i Wyoming upplever ökade risker för skogsbränder på grund av stigande temperaturer. Mer frekventa och allvarliga bränder påverkar djurlivet, förändrar landskap och stör den naturliga geotermiska aktiviteten. Dessa miljöpåverkan hotar parkens ekologiska mångfald och den upplevelse som lockar besökare från hela världen.

Chesapeake Bay, som sträcker sig över Maryland och Virginia, står inför miljöpåverkan från föroreningar, överfiske, förlust av livsmiljöer och stigande vatten. Erosion av kustlinjer och våtmarker hotar både djurlivet och lokalsamhällena. Medan restaureringsarbetet fortsätter är vikens långsiktiga hälsa fortfarande osäker, vilket belyser de bredare svårigheter som kustekosystem står inför över hela landet.

Hawaiis korallrev är under allvarlig press i takt med att havstemperaturerna stiger och försurningen ökar. Korallblekning har skadat viktiga marina livsmiljöer, vilket påverkar den biologiska mångfalden och den lokala fiske- och turistnäringen. Trots pågående bevarandeinitiativ står dessa känsliga ekosystem inför långsiktiga risker om de globala klimattrenderna fortsätter okontrollerade.

Slutligen upplever Alaskas arktiska nationella naturreservat, ett av landets sista orörda vildmarksområden, stigande temperaturer och potentiell industriell expansion. Förändringar i vilda djurs migrationsmönster och hot mot arters överlevnad äventyrar både den naturliga miljön och ursprungsbefolkningarna. Reservatets bevarande är avgörande, men dess framtid är fortfarande osäker.

Florida, Alaska, Kalifornien, Louisiana, Montana, Maryland, Virginia, Hawaii och andra amerikanska delstater upplever akuta klimatpåverkan, från stigande havsnivåer, skogsbränder och glaciärers reträtt till korallblekning, eroderande stränder och hotad arktisk vildmark, vilket omformar städer, parker och ekosystem över hela landet.

Från urbana knutpunkter till avlägsen vildmark konfronterar USA de verkliga och omedelbara konsekvenserna av klimatförändringarna. Utan ihållande och beslutsamma åtgärder står dessa ikoniska destinationer, ekosystem och samhällen inför djupgående och potentiellt oåterkalleliga förluster.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/destination-1-4.jpg,N,,2025-10-16 20:12:17.442164

And rather than progress, the announcement on Tuesday by Stellantis that it will move production of the Jeep Compass from Brampton, Ont. to the Belvidere Assembly plant in Illinois suggests that U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick was serious when he told a business audience that Canada eventually won’t make cars and should think about where else it can create jobs and prosperity.

The Liberal government has said it will hold automakers to commitments made to secure public funding under Canada’s Strategic Innovation Fund.

Bloomberg reported on Wednesday that Industry Minister Mélanie Joly has written to Stellantis saying that the company would be “in default” of federal funds if it fails to keep the Brampton plant central to its manufacturing footprint.

“Without this program, for many Arizonans, clean energy will be out of reach,” Mayes said during a virtual press conference Thursday with California Attorney General Rob Bonta.

In Arizona, energy efficiency is key to homeowners during the summer months and can curb energy bills, which are increasing for many people as the impacts of climate change are leading to intensely high temperatures.","Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes joined 21 other states in challenging a decision by the Environmental Protection Agency to end the $7 billion Solar for All program.

“Without this program, for many Arizonans, clean energy will be out of reach,” Mayes said during a virtual press conference Thursday with California Attorney General Rob Bonta.

The two lawsuits, which Mayes are co-leading, include 21 states, along with the District of Columbia, and claims the EPA acted unlawfully when it shuttered the program getting rid of $156 million in grants already established for Arizona. That included a $25 million grant to the Hopi Tribe that would have aided in the creation of solar panels and battery storage for homes on the Hopi Reservation for approximately 600 homes.

“The loss of the Solar for all Program will also make it more difficult for Arizonans to meet the expected 40% increase in energy demand,” Mayes said.

The Grand Canyon State is home to 151 data centers and counting — Arizona is No. 7 in the number of data centers nationally — which used more than 1.5 gigawatts of electricity in 2024.

Utility rates in the state have also continued to skyrocket, as customers with Arizona Public Service are anticipated to see a double-digit increase in their rates starting next year, with concerns that Arizona’s booming data center economy could make matters worse for consumers.

At the heart of the lawsuit is Trump’s $3.4 trillion deficit-boosting tax cut and spending package, H.R. 1, also known as the “One Big Beautiful Bill.” It fulfills a number of his administration’s domestic policy priorities, including a major reversal on clean energy initiatives.

This is the second lawsuit this week that Arizona has taken a party to as the states have claimed that the EPA breached their contracts by cancelling the program.

“Despite Congress’s express decision to rescind only ‘unobligated balances,’ the EPA interpreted H.R. 1 as somehow rescinding all appropriations related to Solar for All,” the lawsuit says. “Not only erroneous as a matter of statutory interpretation, but the EPA’s view is also erroneous as a matter of contract law: the EPA’s interpretation of H.R. 1 does not constitute grounds for termination under the express terms and conditions of the Grant Agreements.”

The lawsuits are number 43 and 44 for the state of California against the Trump administration in 38 weeks — “more than one a week,” noted Bonta.

“Terminating Solar for All is unlawful,” Bonta said. “We will see the administration in court again.”

Due to the cuts made by Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” to programs like Solar for All and other clean energy initiatives, Arizonans will have until the end of year to take advantage of the 30% federal tax credit — an average of $9,000 in savings — to install solar panels.

The credit, which was created in 2022 by the Inflation Reduction Act, was originally set to expire in July 2036, but Trump’s budget bill takes specific aim at a number of clean energy initiatives included in the IRA, which was one of President Joe Biden’s key legislative victories.

In Arizona, energy efficiency is key to homeowners during the summer months and can curb energy bills, which are increasing for many people as the impacts of climate change are leading to intensely high temperatures.

The cuts also are estimated to cost the state approximately $58 billion and 69,000 jobs due to the loss of many projects, according to the Arizona Commerce Authority.",https://azmirror.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/solarpanelworker2025-2048x1365.jpg,N,,2025-10-16 19:10:30.401082

It is a glimpse of a future where every EV is an energy asset,” said Douglas Alfaro, Chief Business Development Officer at Wallbox.","EVSE manufacturer Wallbox has completed the first US residential installations of its Quasar 2 bidirectional EV charger. Six Quasar 2 units were deployed in Menifee, California, through a collaboration with Kia America and the University of California, Irvine.

Bidirectional charging enables vehicle-to-home (V2H) applications, which offer several benefits for homeowners. Energy stored in an EV’s battery can be used to power a home during a utility outage. Homeowners whose local utility offers time-of-use (TOU) pricing can lower electricity bills by charging their EV’s battery during off-peak times and discharging it during peak demand periods.

V2H is a coming attraction. Wallbox’s recent deployment is intended to gather data and learn how customers interact with the new technology. As far as we know, Wallbox has only demonstrated the feature with the Kia EV9, and when it becomes available, it will be part of the Kia Connect subscription-based suite of services.

“This is more than a technology milestone. It is a glimpse of a future where every EV is an energy asset,” said Douglas Alfaro, Chief Business Development Officer at Wallbox. “Quasar 2 puts homeowners in control of their energy, helping them achieve resilience, independence and sustainability in their daily lives.”

“As we continue to expand our lineup of electric vehicles, projects like this help us showcase how EVs can deliver value beyond mobility, playing a central role in energy management and sustainability at home,” said Sujith Somasekharan, Director, Connected Car & Mobility at Kia America.",https://chargedevs.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/01_QUASAR_2_KIA_EV9_CCS1PRU-copy.jpg,N,,2025-10-16 20:07:52.637315

The leaders also launched the ‘India-Australia Green Hydrogen Taskforce’ report. “It provides a solid foundation and clear direction for our collaboration. Looking forward to a strong partnership in shaping a sustainable energy future,” the minister further added.

Bowen was also slated to meet Power Minister Manohar Lal for the 5th India-Australia Energy Dialogue. In November last year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Australian counterpart, Anthony Albanese, held the second India-Australia Annual Summit on the sidelines of the Group of 20 (G20) Summit in Rio de Janeiro.

They shared an ambition to move faster, work together and deploy complementary capabilities to drive climate action. PM Modi lauded the launch of the India-Australia Renewable Energy Partnership (REP), which would provide the framework for practical cooperation in priority areas such as solar PV, green hydrogen, energy storage, two-way investment in renewable energy projects and allied areas; and upgraded skills training for the renewable workforce of the future.

Investment in clean, innovative fuels such as SAF, methanol, and ammonia with 45Z SAF tax credit maximum value reduced by 43% in H.R.
1’s drastically shortened availability timeline for the 45V Clean Hydrogen Production Tax Credit.","H.R. 1, the so-called “One Big Beautiful Bill” Act (OBBBA), enacted on July 4, 2025, expands the 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit (45Z) by extending it through 2029 and loosening eligibility requirements associated with transportation fuels’ carbon intensity (CI). Simultaneously, amendments to the 45Z credit within H.R. 1 dramatically reduce the maximum per-gallon credit value available to sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) producers: from $1.75/gallon to $1.00/gallon. Together, these and other changes to 45Z are expected to: (1) cost taxpayers $25.7 billion from FY25-34 (despite repealing the higher credit value for SAF), (2) expand tax credits for conventional biofuels that already benefit from other federal support and have limited greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction potential, and (3) limit federal incentives for domestic production of innovative fuels like SAF. 45Z as modified will not decrease GHG emissions of domestic fuel or promote production of domestic clean fuels.

Background

Congress created 45Z in the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022. The IRA set the maximum credit value at $1.00/gallon for eligible clean fuels, which included those with a CI of less than 50 kg CO2e/mmBTU produced in calendar years 2025-2027. Additionally, SAF was granted a higher maximum credit value of $1.75/gallon. Congress also required the tax credit to be adjusted annually for inflation. Fuels that earned other tax credits, like 45V (hydrogen production) or 45Q (carbon sequestration), were not allowed to stack these credits with 45Z. When the IRA was passed, the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) estimated that the 45Z credit (in place from 2025-2027) would cost about $2.9 billion over FY25-28.

The IRA made other changes to federal biofuel tax credits, including eliminating the biomass-based diesel credit, the second-generation biofuel credit, and other alternative fuel tax credits with the intent of replacing them with the technology-neutral 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit. In addition, the IRA created the standalone 40B SAF tax credit, available in calendar years 2023-2024 (i.e., the two-year period before 45Z became operative). Fuels that reduced lifecycle GHG emissions by at least 50% could earn a credit of $1.25/gallon, up to $1.75/gallon on a sliding scale for each percent reduction in GHG emissions. Beginning in 2025, 40B was folded into 45Z, maintaining the maximum rate for SAF of $1.75/gallon.

Table 1: IRA fuel tax credits

Significant H.R. 1 Amendments to 45Z

One of the most significant changes to 45Z within H.R. 1 is a provision excluding emissions associated with indirect land use change (ILUC) from a fuel’s CI score. Ignoring ILUC can decrease CI scores of certain land-intensive conventional biofuels like corn ethanol and soy biodiesel by ignoring up to 20-25 g CO2e/MJ, yielding higher per-gallon tax credits for these fuels. ILUC-related GHG emissions are generated from land use conversion (e.g., clearing grasslands or forests – releasing carbon in the process – to replace food production on lands converted to biofuel crops) and other market-mediated effects not directly related to the biofuel crop. ILUC-related GHG emissions of biofuels derived from feedstocks that do not require dedicated land, such as agricultural and forestry residues and wastes, or feedstocks that may improve land systems (e.g., winter crops on seasonally fallow land, perennials on marginal land) may be more favorable and may be indirectly affected by this change if it encourages the continued reliance on conventional biofuel feedstocks.

In addition, H.R. 1 stripped the special SAF rate of $1.75/gallon, dropping it to $1.00/gallon to match all other clean fuels. This modification limits the incentive for domestic investment in new or expanded SAF facilities. SAF is still expensive to produce, as it is a nascent industry, and requires more support than other clean fuels to reach commercial scale. Many SAF producers factored the $1.75/gallon credit value into their business models and are now facing serious risks to investment and production capacity with the newly lowered credit value. SAF production facilities are currently positioned in states ranging from California to Montana with expansion planned in the West, South, Northwest, and Midwest in coming years. However, it is not clear how much of the planned expansion will proceed, as project developers around the country reckon with these changes.

The Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) estimated that the new 45Z, including H.R. 1 changes, will cost taxpayers $25.7 billion through its expiration in 2029. When the IRA was passed, JCT estimated that 45Z would cost about $2.9 billion over four years. The significant expansion in cost from the 2022 estimate to the 2025 estimate is not tied to an increase inpublic benefits (such as reduced emissions); rather, the order-of-magnitude increase in cost results from Congress’s decisions to weaken the law’s carbon accounting requirements and allow a broader set of conventional biofuel producers to claim the credit.

Table 2: Summary of 45Z modifications in H.R. 1 compared to the IRA

Impacts of 45Z Modifications

The changes made to 45Z will cost taxpayers more while undermining U.S. competitiveness, innovation, and climate progress.

H.R. 1 changes to 45Z will benefit:

Domestic corn ethanol and soy biodiesel industries, with more gallons of current conventional biofuel production eligible for the tax credit at higher per-gallon tax credit rates compared to those under the IRA version of 45Z, mainly due to the new version’s directive against counting ILUC emissions. Increased production of corn ethanol and soy biodiesel could occur at the margin due to 45Z incentives, but domestic corn ethanol consumption growth is constrained by infrastructure, limited purchases of high-ethanol fuel blends, and flat or declining gasoline consumption nationwide. The corn ethanol industry could experience growth if domestic alcohol-to-jet (ATJ) fuel production scales, however the new 45Z disincentivizes this industry, which is still in early stages of development. Even without significant volumetric growth, these industries will benefit from higher per-gallon subsidies.

Soy-based renewable diesel production is especially likely to benefit from higher per-gallon tax credits. As a mature and expanding industry, soy-based renewable diesel does not need taxpayer funding. Biodiesel and renewable diesel are also more expensive than diesel fuel, so unless oil prices increase significantly, production will likely be dictated largely by existing biofuel policies mandating a certain level of consumption each year, such as the federal Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) and California’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS), not by the availability of 45Z credits. As a result, taxpayer dollars are not actually needed to incentivize production of these fuels, making changes to 45Z a windfall for conventional biofuels.

H.R. 1 changes to 45Z will disadvantage:

Taxpayers, since billions of dollars are expected to be spent annually on duplicative tax credits for carbon-intensive, mature biofuels that would be produced anyway under policies like the RFS and LCFS, which already mandate biofuel consumption. 45Z’s expansion and extension is unlikely on its own to spur additional job growth or economic investment in new production facilities nationwide.

Industry investment in innovative fuel production, including companies investing in high-paying jobs across the country to produce fuels for growing markets such as SAF and fuels utilizing clean hydrogen to produce clean ammonia, methanol, etc.

U.S. competitiveness and economic growth, since financial incentives will be shifted toward existing, mature industries like soy-based renewable diesel – an inefficient use of taxpayer dollars – instead of toward new, innovative fuels that generate significant economic growth, business investment, and international investment opportunities.

U.S. positioning as a global leader in SAF production, because companies will likely shift planned SAF investments to other countries, given the decreased financial incentives for domestic SAF production and uncertainty around federal policy.

Climate and environment, with less stringent carbon intensity reduction requirements for 45Z-eligible fuels and less funding directed at much-needed clean alternatives like SAF. The statute no longer requires consideration of the emissions resulting from the potential conversion of carbon-rich land like forests and wetlands which could occur withincreased corn- and soybean-based biofuel production. The production of conventional biofuels now subsidized by 45Z is also associated with worse water, air, and soil quality and diminished wildlife habitat.

Issues to Watch

With statutory changes to 45Z included in H.R. 1, the next step is for the U.S. Treasury and Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to issue new guidance relating to the implementation of those statutory changes. Some issues to watch over the coming months include:

How the removal of ILUC considerations within 45Z carbon intensity scores will be implemented at Treasury/IRS.

Whether and how Treasury/IRS or Argonne National Lab’s GREET model will incorporate certain farming methods (known as Climate Smart Agriculture, or CSA) such as no-till farming into CI scoring for 45Z. This is generally a way for biofuels to reduce their CI scores. There is a lot of uncertainty around the impacts of certain CSA practices, while others can be accurately estimated. Depending on the type of CSA practices that are credited, the implementation of those practices, and their incorporation into CI scores, the environmental benefits of biofuels could be improved or further eroded. Nothing in H.R. 1 authorizes Treasury to reduce a fuel’s carbon intensity score based on CSA practices. The biofuel industry has advocated for their broad inclusion in 45Z. CATF supports the inclusion of highly certain practices with quantifiable impacts, such as enhanced nitrogen efficiency fertilizers and reduced fertilizer use.

Final Renewable Volume Obligations issued by the Environmental Protection Agency for calendar years 2026 and 2027, which will dictate U.S. biofuel consumption as part of the RFS mandate. In June 2025, EPA proposed significantly higher mandates for biomass-based diesel consumption for 2025 and 2026.

Investment in clean, innovative fuels such as SAF, methanol, and ammonia with 45Z SAF tax credit maximum value reduced by 43% in H.R. 1. SAF production expansion announcements across the U.S. may also be affected by H.R. 1’s drastically shortened availability timeline for the 45V Clean Hydrogen Production Tax Credit.

U.S. fuels policy should support innovative fuels to reduce emissions and grow the U.S. economy. H.R. 1’s changes to 45Z fail to deliver either of those objectives. Instead, they will cost taxpayers billions to subsidize mature industries with limited public benefit.",https://cdn.catf.us/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/02115443/airplane-runway-web.jpg,N,,2025-10-16 19:10:52.040270

Despite the loss of incentives for several popular models, the EV Advocates of Ventura County—a volunteer group dedicated to promoting electric transportation— forged ahead with events celebrating National Drive Electric Month, reminding residents that environmental progress can outlast government incentives.

At the Port of Hueneme Banana Festival on Sept. 27, the group showcased nine electric vehicles and an electric school bus from the Oxnard Union High School District. Throughout the county, school districts are steadily transitioning to clean-emission electric buses.

A week later, on Oct. 5, the group gathered 66 vehicles on the lawn at Ventura Harbor, drawing several hundred visitors. EV owners displayed 46 different models, ranging from a first-generation Nissan Leaf to a 2026 Hyundai Ioniq 9, and from electric motorcycles to a brand-new VW ID. Buzz microbus. Two of the most talked-about exhibits were a 1969 Subaru minibus converted to electric power and a 2025 Dodge EV Daytona Charger.

Thanks to support from the Ventura County Regional Energy Alliance, the Ventura Unified School District brought one of its electric buses to the event, with the driver on hand to answer questions.

Also on display were three Tesla Cybertrucks, including one owned by the event organizer and EV Advocates field representative, Kent Bullard.

Unfazed by the end of federal subsidies, Bullard said he believes that rising gas prices, a growing public charging network and an ever-wider variety of EV models will sustain strong demand.

When asked whether large, powerful EVs might undermine the environmental message of efficiency and conservation, Bullard offered a measured response.

“If people were to buy a Rivian R1S or Cybertruck instead of a gas-burning Suburban or Expedition, that’s a step forward,” he said.

Smaller, lighter vehicles remain the greener option for most drivers, but Bullard’s broader point is clear: electric vehicle technology now spans nearly every transportation need, from compact commuters to long-range haulers.

To demonstrate that EVs can truly “go the distance,” Bullard and another advocate towed their travel trailers to the Ventura Harbor event. Bullard’s 4,000-mile summer road trip with his trailer underscored the increasing practicality of long-distance electric travel.

The local push for EV adoption continues on multiple fronts.

In Camarillo, Tesla has been building two new Supercharger sites. The location on the west side of the outlet mall is already live, featuring 20, 325 kW chargers. A second station with 24 chargers at Camarillo Plaza is awaiting utility connection. Additionally, two dual-head Level 2 chargers are being installed near the Camarillo Family YMCA, and a 30-unit project at CSU Channel Islands is delayed pending infrastructure upgrades.

In Thousand Oaks, Cal State Northridge has installed 46 Level 2 chargers at Montclef and Olsen roads. A new site at Cho Cho San, 400 E. Thousand Oaks Blvd., will include two DC fast chargers and three Level 2 units.

Federal subsidies may be winding down, but Ventura County’s growing charging infrastructure and grassroots advocacy efforts continue to drive electric momentum—proving that local action, not just national policy, powers long-term environmental progress.

Where the market stands

The U.S. sold about 1.3 million electric vehicles in 2024, a record-high number. Still, EVs remain less than 10% of new vehicle registrations.

Through the first half of 2025, cumulative electric vehicle sales in the U.S. totaled just over 568,000 units, up roughly 1.6 % from the same period a year earlier. The end of the federal subsidies could slow growth in the fourth quarter compared to earlier ones, but if sales accelerate in Q4, the current year could beat 2024.

The EV market in 2025 is not uniformly strong—growth is concentrated among certain automakers and models. Kia’s electric vehicle sales dropped 54 % in the first half of 2025 vs. 2024. Mercedes’ EV sales also came under pressure. Tesla remains the largest single seller.

Applications re-open every year during autumn to ensure that they are prepared for the cool weather during the winter months.

As of October 1, 2025, Indiana residents can apply for IndyEAP benefits worth around $400.

It’s the state’s Energy Assistance Program, which provides a financial cushion for income-eligible households within Marion County to keep utility services up and running.

Marion County predominantly surrounds the city of Indianapolis.

Applications can be filled out on the IndyEAP website, and only three criteria must be met to be eligible for a direct payment.

First, the Marion County residency must be met, with a ZIP code for the primary residence of an applicant being within the county limits.

Secondly, they must also be a US citizen, US national, or qualified non-citizen to get funds.

And lastly, IndyEAP requires that the last three months of household income for all persons 18 and older be reported in the application.

Those income levels must be less than certain set amounts.

For example, a one person household would need to have not made over $8,389 in the three-month span, and a household of eight must not make more than $22,263 during the same period.

DOCUMENTATION REQUIRED

IndyEAP also notes that applications should not submit photo IDs, Social Security cards, copies of apartment lease agreements, or copies of birth certificates in the application process as they are no longer required.

The only necessary documents are a signed application, recent proof of income documents, and a utility bill.

Applications can be submitted through April 20, 2026 and are expected to take about 55 days to process.

After approval, it could take another 60 days for the utility provider get them.

Those who already applied and are eligible can expect their benefits to be sent to their utility provider starting November 1.

On December 1, the moratorium protection period begins as well, meaning that those who applied for IndyEAP before then are protected from disconnection until March 15, 2026.

It’s also important to note that IndyEAP only assists with electric and gas bills, not water bills.

Several other states have also been offering energy assistance payments this month through their own programs.

NOT ALONE

In North Dakota, for example, residents can get funds worth up to $1,100 as of October 1 thanks to the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP).

LIHEAP is federally funded but carried out at a state level, and North Dakota obtained more than $23 million in funding this year.

The one-time distributions will go out until May 31, 2026, for eligible applications who have income levels at or below 60% of the state median.

Applications can be submitted online or by mail through the North Dakota Health and Human services website.

And projects from wind and solar projects produce little energy and, usually, unproductive, often temporary jobs. Increasing productivity is the key to economic growth and raising living standards, and these projects don’t fit the bill.

Clean Energy Economy Minnesota recently released its annual jobs report for clean energy fields. MPRNews reports the findings, in brief:

Its latest report released Wednesday estimates that number grew to almost 64,000 in 2024, a 2.6 percent increase from the previous year. Jobs in clean energy-related fields grew more than two times faster than the state’s total workforce.

Of note is that the “two times faster” is only 2.6 percent, while the overall economy in Minnesota grew one percent. This is not necessarily the behavior of an economic engine. American Experiment has covered the same report over several years (2017, 2019, 2020). The 2018 numbers counted 61,047 total jobs, and in 2024 there is now 63,802.

Energy efficiency is 72.3% of the “clean energy” jobs

Another important point: two-thirds of the jobs that Clean Energy Economy Minnesota is counting as “clean energy” fields are not what most people would consider clean energy jobs:

About two-thirds of Minnesota’s clean energy jobs are in energy efficiency, such as upgrading heating and cooling systems, installing LED lighting or manufacturing power-saving appliances…

In fact, the fact sheet of the report finds that 46,177 jobs are “energy efficiency,” jobs, with 11,715 in “Energy STAR and Efficient Lighting,” 12,635 in “High Efficiency HVAC & Renewable H&C,” and 4,682 in “Advanced Materials.” Astonishingly, 9,580 are in “Traditional HVAC” fields.

Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning jobs would exist regardless of clean energy goals. I have to wonder how many HVAC employees consider themselves in the business of “energy efficiency.”

For comparison, 9,167 jobs, or 14.4 percent, are in the realm of “renewable energy generation,” including 5,390 in solar and 2,870 in wind. 2,099 are in “clean storage” grid jobs.

There are more jobs in traditional HVAC counted as “clean energy” jobs than the entirety of the jobs created by renewable energy generation.

Construction jobs are temporary

Those jobs that are truly in wind, solar, battery storage, and electrified transport tend to be construction jobs. As Martha Njolomole noted in 2020, “The majority of jobs in “clean energy” are temporary construction jobs that should not be counted as part of energy jobs because their overall impact on Minnesota`s economy is very short-lived.” There is nothing inherently wrong with part-time or temporary construction jobs but treating renewable energy as a panacea for long-term job creation is a misunderstanding at best.

In the most recent edition of this report, 54.7 percent of these jobs are in construction, and 10.8 percent in manufacturing. Another 16 percent are in professional services and 8.9 percent in trade.

Administration’s actions are a needed correction to the market

MPRNews continues with predictions about the fate of the clean energy industry thanks to Trump:

However, the report doesn’t reflect the effects of President Donald Trump’s tax and spending act, which Congress passed in July. It ended some tax credits for clean energy projects on Dec. 31…

As I wrote in a letter to the editor in the Wall Street Journal:

The reconciliation bill doesn’t remove tax credits retroactively, and phaseouts won’t start for several years. Projects still qualify if they produce electricity by the end of 2027 or by 2030 if they begin construction by next summer. If wind and solar are cost-competitive, then losing tax credits shouldn’t “strand capital previously invested in projects that won’t now come online.” That developers expect to abandon projects without taxpayer dollars shows that 30 years of subsidies have merely shifted costs to taxpayers.

Projects that start by next summer and wrap up construction by 2030 could still be receiving subsidies by 2040. Subsidies drive up the costs of electricity for taxpayers, and wind and solar impose system costs through overbuilding and backup generation. Driving up electricity costs creates job losses, especially those in energy-intensive industries like mining and manufacturing.

The goal is energy, not unproductive jobs

If the industry can become economical for consumers without subsidies from the taxpayer, then the industry should look forward to building as much wind and solar as the market truly demands.

As always, the idea must be to produce energy in the most efficient ways possible, not to maximize jobs created. John Phelan noted this aptly in 2017:

The point of an energy industry is to generate energy, not to generate jobs. If it was, we could hire people to stand in front of wind turbines blowing at them to make them turn faster. The effect energy generation would be non existent but the effect on employment need only be limited by how many blowers we can fit in a field.

The upside of Clean Energy Economic Minnesota counting so many construction, maintenance, and repair jobs, especially those in energy efficiency, as “clean energy” jobs is that those jobs will quite likely persist beyond the phase-out of the tax credits. Next year’s report will be instructive.",https://files.americanexperiment.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/arno-senoner-6lOxktnqo04-unsplash-scaled.jpg?v=1733332540,N,,2025-10-16 18:08:47.482610

Kentucky has joined a lawsuit against the Trump administration for terminating a solar program, but West Virginia has not.

In August, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency pulled the plug on the $7 billion Solar for All Program, money Congress had obligated in the Inflation Reduction Act.

Kentucky was set to receive $62 million, and West Virginia, $106 million.

On Wednesday, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear joined 21 states and the District of Columbia in challenging the program’s termination in Federal Claims Court.

Neither West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey, nor Attorney General J.B. McCuskey, moved to participate in the lawsuit.

The funds were supposed to pay for the installation of solar panels on residential rooftops and improve home energy efficiency.

The program was intended to help low-income and disadvantaged residents, who bear the biggest burden from rising electricity costs.

Zachary Turner: Duke files a resource plan every two years.

Meanwhile, the state legislature rolled back that key 2030 climate target and made financing new nuclear reactors less risky for Duke Energy.
Everyone who’s not Duke Energy is still poring over this massive filing.","Duke Energy filed its 2025 resource plan earlier this month. The filing has drawn sharp criticism from environmental and clean energy advocates, and even has some business groups skeptical about future rate hikes.

WFAE’s climate reporter Zachary Turner sat down with host Nick de la Canal to break down what you need to know:

Nick de la Canal: To begin, what is this plan, and why should we care about it?

Zachary Turner: Duke files a resource plan every two years. It’s a roadmap that says what Duke’s going to build, like new power plants, when it’s going to build them, and about how much it’s going to cost ratepayers.

It also projects how much energy folks will need, and how the utility will supply it while lowering greenhouse gas emissions. Ideally.

De la Canal: Ideally?

Turner: Well, Duke’s resource plan also details how the utility will reach carbon neutrality by 2050. This means eliminating all greenhouse gas emissions that the utility doesn’t plan to offset with carbon credits.

Until earlier this year, the state mandated Duke to reduce emissions by 70% of 2005 levels by 2030 -- which is just five years away.

De la Canal: Right. That brings us to the differences between this plan and the 2023 plan. So, what’s changed?

Turner: The changes in this plan reflect the changes in the federal and state legislative landscape.

President Trump is ending clean energy tax credits, but preserving or creating incentives for battery storage and nuclear. He’s also putting his administration’s full weight behind fossil fuels.

Meanwhile, the state legislature rolled back that key 2030 climate target and made financing new nuclear reactors less risky for Duke Energy.

The result is a plan that pumps the brakes on solar energy, punts on wind energy and leans more heavily on natural gas and battery storage in the short term. Carbon pollution will go up during the next decade, with new gas plants coming online, and coal plants running up to an extra four years.

De la Canal: That makes sense. If the utility burns more fossil fuels, then its carbon emissions also go up.

Turner: Exactly. Burning fossil fuels is a primary driver of climate change. It’s also potentially driving up customers’ power bills, tying customer rates to fuels like natural gas that have volatile prices. Senior attorney David Neal with the Southern Environmental Law Center brought up that point at a recent conference in Raleigh:

David Neal: A big consequence of removing the interim target is unlocking Duke's plans to build more gas plants in the near term and to delay coal retirements, and that is going to put so much risk on customers

Turner: The plan also bets big on new nuclear reactors coming online in the late 2030s to curb those emissions and maybe even come close to meeting the 2050 carbon neutrality target.

De la Canal: What does that mean for the average person?

Turner: Right now, this is just a proposal. But if the commission approves this plan, it means bills will go up. Duke forecasts an unprecedented increase in energy demand over the next 10-15 years. That means building new infrastructure, increasing bills by an average 2.1% annually over the next 10 years.

There are also air quality concerns for power plant neighbors. For folks living near one of three coal plants, it means those facilities will continue running, with the Cliffside plant in Cleveland County running until 2040.

De la Canal: What are people saying about the plan?

Turner: Some business groups like Duke’s “all of the above” approach, because Duke markets this as the cheapest and most reliable pathway.

However, other groups, like the Carolina Utility Customers Association, worry more natural gas plants will strain North Carolina’s gas supply for industrial companies.

Other concerns about the plan fall into a few main camps:

There’s the climate problem. This plan goes against international climate goals to reduce near-term carbon emissions. We know Hurricane Helene and Tropical Storm Chantal were made worse by warmer ocean temperatures. Extreme heat and sea level rise continue to be a concern, and these problems don’t just go away if we reach carbon neutrality by 2050, and they certainly get worse the longer we burn fossil fuels.

Next, some groups worry that Duke plans to build too much new infrastructure. If Duke builds out a bunch of new gas-powered turbines for giant new electricity-guzzling customers like data centers who don’t ultimately come, ratepayers will get stuck with the bill.

De la Canal: What comes next?

Everyone who’s not Duke Energy is still poring over this massive filing. In the coming months, folks will comment on it and some groups might submit their own independent modeling of energy demand. The state’s new Energy Task Force, for example, will be trying to verify Duke’s findings.

Next year, the utilities commission will hold public hearings across the state before it takes a vote.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6ab7e45/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5568x2923+0+294/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe0%2F60%2F6413e56f4efeb467895c93bb33be%2F011423-duke-asheville-plant.JPG,N,,2025-10-16 18:10:09.380617

AEP said it plans to work with local communities and landowners on critical transmission lines.
Wright, in a conference call with reporters, distinguished the AEP loan guarantee from a $4.9 billion federal loan guarantee the department cancelled in July.","OHIO — The Department of Energy said Thursday it has finalized a $1.6 billion loan guarantee to a subsidiary of one of the nation's largest power companies to upgrade nearly 5,000 miles of transmission lines across five states, mostly in the Midwest, for largely fossil fuel-run energy.

American Electric Power Transmission will upgrade power lines in Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Oklahoma and West Virginia, primarily to enhance enhance grid reliability and capacity, the Energy Department said. The project is meant to help meet surging electricity demand from data centers and artificial intelligence.

AEP said the upgrades would save customers an estimated $275 million in financing costs over the lifetime of the loan.

These projects will replace existing transmission lines with new lines that will be able to carry more energy, providing more reliability and further promoting economic growth, AEP said.

The work is expected to create 1,100 construction jobs.

“AEP is experiencing growth in energy demand that has not been seen in a generation. As the first company to close a new loan with the Trump Administration under this program, we are excited to get to work on these projects to improve the service we provide to our customers,” said Bill Fehrman, AEP chairman, president and chief executive officer. “This loan saves our customers money and improves reliability while supporting economic growth in our states. The funds we will save through this program enable us to make additional investments to enhance service for our customers.”

AEP stated energy demand has increased across its footprint, mainly due to business expansions that are expected to need an additional 24 gigawatts of electricity by 2030, AEP said. The updates are to help support data centers, artificial intelligence and manufacturing development without overloading the electric system.

The move comes as the Trump administration has moved to cancel $7.6 billion in grants that supported hundreds of clean energy projects in 16 states, all of which voted for Democrat Kamala Harris in last year’s presidential election. A total of 223 projects were terminated after a review determined they did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs or were not economically viable, the Energy Department said.

The cancellations include up to $1.2 billion for California’s hydrogen hub aimed at producing clean-burning hydrogen fuels to power ships and heavy-duty trucks. A hydrogen project costing up to $1 billion in the Pacific Northwest also was cancelled.

The loan guarantee finalized Thursday is the first offered by the Trump administration under the recently renamed Energy Dominance Financing program created by the massive tax-and-spending law approved this summer by congressional Republicans and signed by President Donald Trump. Electric utilities that receive loans through the program must provide assurances to the government that financial benefits from the financing will be passed on to customers, the Energy Department said.

The project and others being considered will help ensure that Americans ""will have access to affordable, reliable and secure energy for decades to come,” Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in a statement.

“The president has been clear: America must reverse course from the energy subtraction agenda of past administrations and strengthen our electrical grid,'' Wright said, adding that modernizing the grid and expanding transmission capacity ""will help position the United States to win the AI race and grow our manufacturing base.”

In Ohio alone, there will be 76 projects to replace 2,122 lines, according to AEP. That's expected to serve approximately 1.5 million Ohio customers. Additionally, about 100 lines in Ohio and Oklahoma have been identified to be the first set of projects to be worked on for the loan guarantee.

More than 1,400 miles in Indiana and Michigan serving 600,000 customers, the company said. An additional 1,400 miles in Oklahoma, serving about 1.2 million people and 26 miles in West Virginia, serving 460,000 people, will be replaced.

AEP said it plans to work with local communities and landowners on critical transmission lines.

The loan guarantee will save customers money and improve reliability while supporting economic growth in the five states, said Bill Fehrman, AEP's chairman, president and chief executive officer.

“The funds we will save through this program enable us to make additional investments to enhance service for our customers,"" he added.

Wright, in a conference call with reporters, distinguished the AEP loan guarantee from a $4.9 billion federal loan guarantee the department cancelled in July. That money would have boosted the planned Grain Belt Express, a new high-voltage transmission line set to deliver solar and wind-generated electricity from the Midwest to eastern states.

The Energy Department said at the time it was “not critical for the federal government to have a role” in the first phase of the $11 billion project planned by Chicago-based Invenergy. The department also questioned whether the project could meet strict financial conditions required, a claim Wright repeated Thursday.

“Ultimately that is a commercial enterprise that needs private developers,” Wright said. The company has indicated the Grain Belt project will go forward.

Trump and Wright have repeatedly derided wind and solar energy as unreliable and opposed efforts to combat climate change by moving away from fossil fuels. Wright said the Grain Belt Express loan was among billions of dollars worth of commitments “rushed out the doors” by former President Joe Biden’s administration after the 2024 election.",https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/AP_texas_powergrid_41624,N,,2025-10-16 19:12:10.608900

Attorney General Jeff Jackson and representatives of 22 other states, as well as the District of Columbia, sued the EPA on Wednesday, saying the agency illegally canceled the Solar for All program.

Solar for All, a Biden-era initiative launched as part of the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022, allocated $7 billion in grants nationally to 60 recipients including states, tribes, and regions. The funds were earmarked for solar projects like rooftop solar and community solar gardens for more than 900,000 lower-income households.

The program’s discontinuation signified the Trump administration’s push away from cleaner energy, following additional cuts in the “One Big Beautiful Bill.”

Democrats in North Carolina’s congressional delegation sent a letter to EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin in August, asking him to reconsider and ultimately reverse the program’s termination, NC Newsline previously reported.

Jackson said the funds would have helped low-income and rural North Carolinians save money on their energy bills.

“Thousands of families were going to have the option to install solar power, save money, and have another energy option after a major storm,” Jackson said in a statement. “Now EPA has illegally cancelled those funds — so I’m going to court to bring $150 million back to our state.”

North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality Secretary Reid Wilson said the program’s cancellation eliminates the installation of rooftop solar panels for more than 12,000 low- and medium-income families.

Projects using Solar for All funds were planned to start in fall 2025, according to Jackson’s office.

“Rooftop solar drives down utility bills, reduces air pollution and creates jobs. The program’s cancellation would hurt the electric grid’s ability to be resilient to future disasters, and would hamper North Carolina’s efforts to ensure reliable, clean and affordable energy supplies to meet the needs of a rapidly growing population and rising energy demand,” Wilson said in a statement.

Representatives for the EPA did not immediately respond to NC Newsline’s request for comment.

Plaintiffs described the EPA’s cancellation of the program and subsequent unilateral termination of all grant agreements as “a clear, unambiguous, and material breach of the agreements between the EPA and Plaintiffs,” the lawsuit read.

The plaintiffs’ grant agreements allowed for termination “only in the narrow circumstances of substantial noncompliance that materially impairs performance, adequate evidence of waste, fraud or abuse, or material representation of eligibility status,” the lawsuit read. Plaintiffs said these matters did not occur.

Canada has threatened legal action against carmaker Stellantis NV over what Ottawa says is the company’s unacceptable plan to shift production of one model to a United States plant.

Stellantis is a global automotive giant formed in 2021 from the merger of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles and PSA Group. As the world’s fourth-largest automaker by volume, Stellantis owns well-known brands including Jeep, Ram, Dodge, Peugeot, and Citroën. The company operates across North America, Europe, and other key markets, offering a broad lineup from passenger cars to trucks and commercial vehicles.

On Wednesday, Minister of Industry Melanie Joly sent a letter to Stellantis CEO Antonio Filosa noting that the company had agreed to maintain its Canadian presence in exchange for substantial financial support.

“Anything short of fulfilling that commitment will be considered a default under our agreement,” she said. If Stellantis did not live up to its commitment, Canada would “exercise all options, including legal,” she said.

In 2025, Stellantis is heavily focused on electrification and innovation, investing billions to develop electric vehicles and battery technologies. It aims to lead in sustainable mobility by launching new electric platforms and expanding hybrid and fully electric models. Stellantis is also adapting to global market challenges, including supply chain disruptions and changing consumer preferences.

Stellantis announced a $13 billion investment in the U.S. on Tuesday, a move that it said would bring five new models to the market, and as part of the plan, production of the Jeep Compass will move to the U.S. state of Illinois from a facility in Brampton in the Canadian province of Ontario.

For Canada, the controversy highlights the challenges of securing long-term commitments from global firms in a highly competitive and shifting auto landscape. As nations compete to attract EV investments, Canada is asserting its expectation that public funding must translate into stable, local jobs. The resolution of this issue could shape future investment policies and serve as a test case for how countries balance industrial support with accountability from private-sector partners.

“I have spoken with Stellantis to stress my disappointment with their decision,” Ontario Premier Doug Ford said in a social media post.

For Stellantis, this situation presents both opportunity and risk. On one hand, the company is strategically positioning itself to expand U.S. operations and meet growing demand for electric and hybrid vehicles. On the other hand, it risks damaging long-standing relationships with Canadian authorities and labor forces, which could complicate future investments and operations in the country.

Stellantis spokesperson LouAnn Gosselin said the company was investing in Canada and noted plans to add a third shift to a plant in Windsor, Ontario.

“Canada is very important to us. We have plans for Brampton and will share them upon further discussions with the Canadian government,” she said in an emailed statement.

This situation also reflects the increasing geopolitical and economic pressure on automakers to localize production amid rising protectionism and trade tensions. As countries like the U.S. and Canada compete for electric vehicle manufacturing and related supply chains, companies such as Stellantis must navigate not only market forces but also evolving government expectations tied to subsidies and job creation.

For Stellantis, balancing cost-efficiency with political goodwill will be critical in preserving access to incentives and avoiding reputational fallout. For Canada, the dispute reinforces the urgency of creating more binding industrial agreements that ensure long-term economic returns on public investment.",https://americanbazaaronline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/stellantis.png,N,,2025-10-16 19:12:18.600368

Andy Beshear has joined elected Democrats from other states in suing the Trump administration to stop what they call the “unlawful termination” of billions of dollars for residential solar projects.

A press release Wednesday from California Attorney General Rob Bonta stated the cancellation of the $7 billion “Solar for All” program denied states “critical funds they were depending on for solar energy in low-income and disadvantaged communities nationwide.”

Bonta is among more than a dozen Democratic attorneys general, along with Beshear and Democratic Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, who are plaintiffs in the lawsuits alleging the program’s termination is illegal and unconstitutional.

When the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency terminated the program in August, Administrator Lee Zeldin in a statement on social media said the agency’s authority to administer the program was eliminated through the passage of a tax-and-spending law signed by Trump this summer. The Associated Press reported Zeldin characterized the program as a “boondoggle.”

An email received Thursday from the EPA’s press office stated the agency doesn’t comment on pending litigation.

Congress created the “Solar for All” program through the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, and the program aimed to expand residential solar energy projects to hundreds of thousands of low-income households across the country.

Kentucky officials planned to use a portion of $62 million from the program to install residential solar panels paired with battery storage systems on homes in “disaster-impacted communities.” A group of stakeholders had met several times this year in planning how the state would use the funding in communities affected by floods and tornadoes.

Robin Hartman, a spokesperson for the Kentucky Energy and Environment Cabinet, in an early September email to the Lantern said the state couldn’t access its “Solar for All” funding because it was being “unlawfully withheld by the federal administration.”

A group of 21 Democratic members of the U.S. House of Representatives on Wednesday urged the PJM Interconnection to make it easier to bring power supplies online, a move they said could help lower electricity costs.

In some parts of PJM, consumers face electric rate increases of more than 20% at a time when many people are struggling to keep up with the cost of living, according to the lawmakers.

“These rate increases are unaffordable and necessitate that PJM respond effectively to pursue reforms to the interconnection process that would address and prevent current and future rate hikes,” the lawmakers said in a letter, which was led by Rep. Don Beyer, D-Va.

The letter comes amid growing concerns about data center growth, which may contribute to rising electricity bills through transmission costs and their use of large amounts of electricity.

Also, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in July ruled that PJM failed to fully meet the agency’s new requirements for how grid operators interconnect power supplies. FERC told PJM to address a range of issues, including the agency’s requirements that interconnection studies reflect the planned charging behavior of battery storage projects and that they include an evaluation of grid-enhancing technologies.

“It’s concerning that when battery storage projects are a low-cost technology and quick way to add capacity to the existing grid, PJM insists on relying … on outdated and conservative charging assumptions to unfairly make battery projects uneconomic,” the lawmakers said.

Grid-enhancing technologies, also called alternative transmission technologies, can be installed more quickly and at lower costs compared to traditional network upgrades, according to the lawmakers.

“Failure to consider them leads to projects paying unnecessarily high grid upgrade costs, projects dropping out of the queue, and customers paying unjust and unreasonable rates,” they said. “This failure has contributed to the capacity auction shortfalls and higher prices we are seeing today.”

PJM is set to respond to FERC’s decision on Oct. 22.

The lawmakers also said PJM should consider additional interconnection reforms.

“Other grid operators have seen great results come from so-called connect and manage techniques, and PJM should work to make its energy-only interconnection pathway, the Energy Resource Interconnection Service, easier to use and faster than alternatives,” the lawmakers said.

The lawmakers also said they were concerned that PJM was favoring gas-fired power plants over other forms of generation and that it was considering expanding avenues for certain proposed generating resources to avoid the grid operator’s standard interconnection process.

As part of its fast-track stakeholder process considering rules for interconnection data centers and other large loads, PJM floated an “expedited interconnection track” for state-supported power projects larger than 500 MW. The fast-track review process would be open for 10 projects a year. The proposal is in addition to PJM’s one-time, fast-track Reliability Resource Initiative, which totals 9.4 GW of mainly gas and battery projects.

“We fear that a focus on new queue-jumping fast tracks for certain resource types or projects serving certain customers betrays a lack of seriousness in fixing the regular-order queue,” the lawmakers said.

Action in Pennsylvania

Meanwhile, Pennsylvania state legislators are also focused on PJM.

Democratic Sens. Nick Pisciottano and Nick Miller on Wednesday said they plan to introduce a resolution directing the Pennsylvania Joint State Government Commission to study their state’s participation in PJM.

The study would consider various issues, including alternative electricity delivery options and whether reforms such as state representation on PJM’s board or expanded state filing rights with federal regulators would benefit Pennsylvania.

Democratic House Rep. Robert Matzie plans to issue a similar resolution.

Despite the moves by lawmakers in Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Illinois to study possible exits from PJM, it’s “extremely unlikely” that any state leaves the grid operator, analysts at Capstone, a research firm, said in a note Tuesday.

Separately, state Sen. Gene Yaw, chairman of the Pennsylvania Senate Environmental Resources and Energy Committee, along with Senate Majority leader Joe Pittman, and 15 other senators — all Republicans — urged PJM to be fuel agnostic in a letter sent to the grid operator on Tuesday.

American Electric Power Transmission will upgrade power lines in Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Oklahoma and West Virginia, primarily to enhance enhance grid reliability and capacity, the Energy Department said. The project is meant to help meet surging electricity demand from data centers and artificial intelligence.

AEP said the upgrades would save customers an estimated $275 million in financing costs over the lifetime of the loan.

These projects will replace existing transmission lines with new lines that will be able to carry more energy, providing more reliability and further promoting economic growth, AEP said.

The work is expected to create 1,100 construction jobs.

“AEP is experiencing growth in energy demand that has not been seen in a generation. As the first company to close a new loan with the Trump Administration under this program, we are excited to get to work on these projects to improve the service we provide to our customers,” said Bill Fehrman, AEP chairman, president and chief executive officer. “This loan saves our customers money and improves reliability while supporting economic growth in our states. The funds we will save through this program enable us to make additional investments to enhance service for our customers.”

AEP stated energy demand has increased across its footprint, mainly due to business expansions that are expected to need an additional 24 gigawatts of electricity by 2030, AEP said. The updates are to help support data centers, artificial intelligence and manufacturing development without overloading the electric system.

“Advancing energy storage science and new technologies is a win-win.","The North Carolina Collaboratory and Innovate Carolina’s UNC Institute for Convergent Science published a report outlining the importance and feasibility of energy storage as existing energy needs and technologies shift.

The energy sector faces multiple challenges in the years ahead.

North Carolina is experiencing robust population growth — an average of 9.5% between 2010 and 2020. Meanwhile, the increased use of electric vehicles and artificial intelligence requires extra electricity per capita. In the midst of growing energy needs, Duke Energy, the state’s largest electricity provider, plans to achieve net-zero emissions by the year 2050.

In 2023, the North Carolina Collaboratory, housed at UNC-Chapel Hill, received $15 million from the North Carolina General Assembly to establish a research program focused on reliably and sustainably meeting the state’s future energy needs. The Next Generation Energy program supports academic research that can help inform and direct the state’s energy industry.

As part of this program, researchers from UNC-Chapel Hill’s economics and chemistry departments in the College of Arts and Sciences prepared “Supercharging Energy Storage Innovations in North Carolina,” a report detailing the benefits of investing in energy storage and the current research moving the field in that direction.

Energy storage entails capturing energy when it is produced faster than it is consumed and saving the excess for times when the reverse is true — like charging a smartphone battery at night to power the phone during the day. These large-scale batteries are important to stabilize the power grid regardless of the energy source, but they are especially crucial as we increase reliance on renewable sources such as wind and solar, which can fluctuate based on the weather and time of day.

The authors of the report explained that as the cost of wind and solar power has declined, their uptake has surged, making energy storage a more relevant issue than ever before. By modeling the ways various factors — like a new carbon tax or lower renewable energy costs — might affect the energy sector, the researchers concluded that capital costs currently remain too high to support widespread use of energy storage, but that research and investment into reducing those costs will yield substantial long-term benefits.

“We find that energy storage isn’t just a future technology. It’s an essential tool for today’s grid and tomorrow’s clean energy transition,” said Jeffrey Warren, executive director of the North Carolina Collaboratory and a professor of the practice of public policy and civic life and leadership. “This report is a call to action for policymakers, researchers and industry leaders to work together and build the infrastructure North Carolina will need.”

The report outlined five recommendations to boost industry investment in short-duration (using energy captured the same day) and long-duration (using energy captured on a previous day) storage solutions:

Make better energy data available for N.C. Detailed, day-to-day data on how North Carolina uses existing energy storage does not currently exist but would be instrumental in informing future decisions.

Enhance investments in long-duration storage. Most of North Carolina’s existing energy storage is short-duration storage.

Establish mechanisms for basic science researchers to communicate and collaborate with applied scientists. Collaboration between researchers making fundamental discoveries about the nature of energy and those working to invent new technologies can accelerate innovation.

Invest in shared user facilities for energy storage research. Core facilities and equipment that many scientists share can lower the barrier to entry for aspiring energy storage researchers.

Invest in metal-ion battery workforce development and innovations, including industry-academic partnerships. Like the lithium-ion batteries in small rechargeable devices, metal-ion battery technology could support large-scale energy storage efforts.

“Energy storage is the bridge between our current grid and the energy future we envision for North Carolina,” said Greg Copenhaver, director of the Institute for Convergent Science, the Chancellor’s Eminent Professor of Convergent Science and chair of the math department at Carolina. “Advancing energy storage science and new technologies is a win-win.

The EPA program, later named SFA, selected 60 grant recipients, including states, tribal governments, local governments, and nonprofit groups, to receive this funding.
In the District Court, Attorney General James and the coalition argue that EPA’s termination of the SFA program is illegal and unconstitutional.
Attorney General James and the coalition also argue in the Court of Federal Claims that revoking the already obligated SFA grants is an illegal breach of contract and taking of property.
Attorney General James and the coalition are seeking a court order from the District Court ruling EPA’s elimination of SFA unlawful and ordering the resumption of the program.","NEW YORK – New York Attorney General Letitia James joined a coalition of plaintiffs in filing two lawsuits to protect billions of dollars in grant funding that would connect nearly one million households nationwide in low-income and vulnerable communities with affordable solar power. In August, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) illegally ended the Solar for All (SFA) program and rescinded billions of dollars already issued to states to fund programs that would bring low-cost home solar power to communities nationwide. Attorney General James and the coalition have filed lawsuits in the Court of Federal Claims and the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington seeking court orders ruling the administration’s termination of SFA unlawful and damages for the termination of individual grants worth billions of dollars.

“Providing more communities with affordable clean energy will help lower energy bills and tackle the climate crisis,” said Attorney General James. “The Solar for All program delivers critical resources to help install solar power on homes across the country. The EPA’s cancellation of Solar for All is illegal and unconstitutional, and I will keep fighting to ensure our communities have access to these funds.”

“The Trump administration's continued assault on clean energy programs, including the attempt to cancel the Solar for All Program, is in direct contrast to the President's claims of wanting U.S. energy independence,” said Governor Kathy Hochul. “The Statewide Solar for All program is part of a true all-of-the-above energy strategy in New York that is designed to generate significant benefits for our health, environment, economy, and for the thousands of New Yorkers who would benefit from lower electric bills.”

“At a time when affordability is top of mind for every New Yorker, especially for those with low to moderate incomes, the federal government should be partnering with states to advance an abundance of locally produced, clean energy that can help provide cost savings on monthly electric bills,” said Doreen M. Harris, President and CEO, New York State Energy Research and Development Authority. “The Environmental Protection Agency’s unlawful termination of the federal Solar for All program is creating a crippling ripple effect on the clean energy industry while forcing hard-working Americans to choose between household essentials as they try to budget for the increasing costs of electricity, heat and groceries.”

As part of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, Congress created and funded an EPA program that would provide states with funding to help low-income and vulnerable communities access clean energy technologies, including rooftop solar power. The EPA program, later named SFA, selected 60 grant recipients, including states, tribal governments, local governments, and nonprofit groups, to receive this funding. In August 2024, EPA announced that it had obligated $7 billion through SFA to deliver residential solar power to more than 900,000 low-income households nationwide. In New York, the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) was awarded $249,800,000 in SFA funding. Leaders in states across the country began developing SFA programs, meeting with community members and utility companies, and negotiating agreements with contractors to help install new solar infrastructure.

In July 2025, the administration enacted legislation that rescinded any remaining funds that had not been obligated as part of SFA. However, in August 2025, EPA began illegally targeting SFA and its funding that had already been obligated to states – funding that should not have been impacted by the new legislation. On August 7, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced, “the Trump EPA is…ending Solar for All for good.” Shortly after, EPA shut down the SFA program and removed up to 90 percent of states’ SFA funds with no explanation.

In the District Court, Attorney General James and the coalition argue that EPA’s termination of the SFA program is illegal and unconstitutional. Stripping this program away entirely from states violates the Administrative Procedure Act and overrides Congress’s constitutional power of the purse. Attorney General James and the coalition also argue in the Court of Federal Claims that revoking the already obligated SFA grants is an illegal breach of contract and taking of property.

Attorney General James and the coalition are seeking a court order from the District Court ruling EPA’s elimination of SFA unlawful and ordering the resumption of the program. In addition, they are seeking damages from the Court of Federal Claims for the unlawful termination of individual grants, including the nearly $250 million grant to NYSERDA.

Joining Attorney General James in filing the lawsuit in the District Court are the attorneys general of Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Massachusetts, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, and the District of Columbia. Also joining the lawsuit are the governors of Kentucky and Pennsylvania, as well as the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation.

Why it matters: The lawsuit, filed this week, argues that the EPA unlawfully eliminated funding meant to expand solar access for low-income households across Texas.

State of play: The $7 billion Biden-era Solar for All program was meant to help lower-income families access solar panels and battery storage systems, saving participants roughly $1,740 annually on their utility bills, per county officials.

Catch up quick: Harris County led other municipalities across the state — including Austin, Dallas County, San Antonio and Waco — in winning $249.7 million in grants from Solar for All in 2024. Of that, $54 million was designated for Harris County.

After President Trump took office, the program's funding was frozen for months.

In August, the EPA officially terminated the program, citing the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

Zoom in: Harris County Attorney Christian Menefee argues in the lawsuit that the One Big Beautiful Bill Act provides ""no authority for EPA's elimination decision.""

Menefee also wrote that the cancellation ""jeopardizes the County's ability to deliver critical infrastructure promised to create thousands of well-paying jobs, protect residents from extreme weather by reinforcing the county's electrical grid, and reduce energy costs for tens of thousands of low-income households.""

What they're saying: Harris County Commissioner Lesley Briones called the decision ""highly irresponsible,"" citing the county's vulnerability during recent hurricanes and winter freezes.

The other side: ""EPA no longer has the authority to administer the program or the appropriated funds to keep this boondoggle alive,"" EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said in August.

Not only will health insurance costs soar for millions if the tax credits are not sustained, there will be severe economic consequences and more than 300,000 Americans could lose their jobs.""","The upcoming expiration of premium tax credits for health insurance could lead to hundreds of thousands of job losses and billions of dollars in reductions to state revenues, according to a new analysis.

The report, released Thursday by the Commonwealth Fund, comes on the 16th day of the ongoing federal government shutdown as congressional Democrats and Republicans have so far failed to agree on a deal to extend the enhanced tax credits from the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, which were bolstered by later legislation such as the American Rescue Plan Act and the Inflation Reduction Act during the Biden administration. The Trump administration's recent One Big Beautiful Bill Act does not extend those enhanced tax credits and also imposes cuts to Medicaid through work requirements. Democrats see the shutdown as a way to gain some leverage with Republicans in reversing some of these moves.

The analysis finds that if the enhanced tax credits are not renewed, state economies would shrink by $40.7 billion in 2026, roughly 339,000 jobs would be lost, and state and local tax revenues would be reduced by $2.5 billion.

The report cites an earlier analysis by the Urban Institute estimating that nearly 5 million people would become uninsured beginning in January 2026, and millions more would see their premiums rise.

Extending the tax credits would help keep health insurance costs affordable, but the push to extend the premium tax credits has become a point of contention on Capitol Hill.

The analysis, led by Leighton Ku and colleagues at GW, used new data to update earlier research that explored the economic impacts of letting the ACA marketplace tax credits expire.

The analysis finds that federal funding for marketplace tax credits will decline by $31 billion unless the enhanced tax credits are renewed. The reductions in funding for health care along with the related downstream impact, will cause state economies to shrink by nearly $41 billion.

Due to these economic losses, nearly 340,000 jobs will be lost in 2026, with slightly less than half in the health care sector. State and local revenues would decline by $2.5 billion.

The states hit hardest by the job losses are mainly in the South, with some of the deepest impacts in red states. Texas would be the state most affected, followed by Florida, Georgia, California, South Carolina, Tennessee, Alabama, Louisiana, North Carolina and Mississippi.

""There is an urgent need to decide whether to extend the ACA tax credits soon; insurance enrollment begins on November 1,"" said Leighton Ku, professor of health policy and lead author of the report, in a statement Thursday. Not only will health insurance costs soar for millions if the tax credits are not sustained, there will be severe economic consequences and more than 300,000 Americans could lose their jobs.""",https://arizent.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e8a7e5/2147483647/strip/true/crop/500x263+0+24/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsource-media-brightspot.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2F8d%2F30%2Fa7e7c9ca41d48599e380d71b560e%2Fp19ipf54g4pfc1mh83t81phkr8kb.jpg,N,,2025-10-16 17:09:30.249510

If the program stays canceled, Coloradans “will not get the benefits of affordable, clean solar energy, including no-cost installations and lower electricity bills,” Weiser said, in a release.
“The loss of jobs will strain the solar industry in our state, which is the twelfth-fastest growing clean energy jobs market in the country.
Weiser and other attorneys general previously won the court battle over federal grants for EV chargers, including $5 billion for a series of fast chargers at strategically space locations.
Colorado said its version of the Solar for All program “will accelerate the adoption of three different solar installation types: single-family rooftop, multifamily rooftop solar and community solar (for residential subscribers),” according to the Colorado Energy Office.","Colorado joined 22 other states Wednesday in suing the Trump administration in federal claims court over cancellation of $7 billion in nationwide grants meant to give lower-income families access to “Solar for All,” including nearly $150 million for the state.

The grants were made under funding provided by the Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act in 2022, and their cancellation in April was part of a rapid string of Trump administration moves to gut renewable energy subsidies and promote traditional fossil fuels with more coal mining and oil drilling on federal land. The lawsuit, joined by Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser, says the Congressional funding and EPA awards could only be legally rescinded for fraud or waste, not over changes in political policy.

Colorado had been awarded $156 million for its Solar for All programs, and the April moves by EPA wiped out all but $11 million of that, Weiser’s office said in announcing the lawsuit. The Colorado grants would have funded programs creating “1,000 jobs and delivering clean solar energy to more than 20,000 low-income households,” the attorney general said.

If the program stays canceled, Coloradans “will not get the benefits of affordable, clean solar energy, including no-cost installations and lower electricity bills,” Weiser said, in a release. “The loss of jobs will strain the solar industry in our state, which is the twelfth-fastest growing clean energy jobs market in the country. … We are bringing these lawsuits to recover the funds and resume this important program.”

The latest suit is part of a fierce ongoing legal battle between Democratic state governments and the GOP Trump administration. Local Democrats and Congressional leaders who passed the 2022 bills say the Trump executive branch does not have the constitutional power to rescind money for programs already approved by Congress.

The Trump administration in turn has called Biden-era renewable energy support a “Green New Scam,” and has tried to pull back money and permitting for everything from fast EV charging networks to major offshore wind electricity farms.

Weiser and other attorneys general previously won the court battle over federal grants for EV chargers, including $5 billion for a series of fast chargers at strategically space locations. A federal judge in June said the administration had overstepped its powers in freezing the EV charger budget, and Colorado was set to resume its grants for the program.

Colorado said its version of the Solar for All program “will accelerate the adoption of three different solar installation types: single-family rooftop, multifamily rooftop solar and community solar (for residential subscribers),” according to the Colorado Energy Office. State officials said the grants would bring lower-priced energy to struggling households while also pushing Colorado faster toward its goals of using 100% clean energy by 2040.",https://newspack-coloradosun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/BasaltVista_HC_08.jpg,N,,2025-10-16 17:08:43.748503

Virtual power plants (VPPs) are emerging as a popular method to aggregate DERs to efficiently respond to fluctuations in energy supply and demand.
VPPs use data analytics to forecast energy needs and dispatch energy from DERs to the grid accordingly.","DER Opportunities

Electricity Costs

DERS are gaining attention among policymakers for several reasons. First, they can offer financial benefits to customers. DERs, like rooftop solar panels, can supply energy directly to the building they are located on. As a result, the customer can lower their electricity bills as they produce more of their own electricity. Additionally, if the DER generates more electricity than the customer needs, they can sell excess electricity back to the grid, depending on market design and technological capability.

Some consumers are also turning to DERs due to the direct control they have over their energy. For example, consumers in areas that experience many outages or extreme weather events may want DERs that allow them to be self-reliant for power. Household battery systems, for example, may be beneficial for users who want to passively store power for emergencies. In areas where rates have increased, some users may also want to generate their own electricity using DERs to have direct control over the cost of their energy consumption.

Accelerated Interconnection

DERs also allow new clean sources of energy to be integrated onto the grid more efficiently. While DERs operate on the distribution grid, traditional large scale energy resources require high-voltage transmission lines to deliver electricity to their site of use. These transmission lines generally cover long distances and require a lengthy siting and development process, resulting in a growing backlog of proposed energy projects waiting in interconnection queues. However, DERs are often located near their site of use, so new transmission infrastructure is not necessary, allowing new energy resources to be deployed more quickly. Though DERs are not immediately “plug and play,” they offer quicker solutions to meet energy needs compared to traditional infrastructure.

Reliability and Resilience

DERs can also improve energy reliability and resilience by decentralizing the grid. Threats to the grid, such as extreme weather events, can damage generating plants for transmission lines and disrupt the supply of power. When the transmission system is interrupted, DERs can still operate and provide power. For example, microgrids are one DER that provides resilience during outages. A microgrid is a group of interconnected loads and DERs within a defined boundary that acts as a single controllable entity, separate from the grid. Therefore, while microgrids operate harmoniously with the larger grid during normal operations, they can also disconnect from the grid to operate autonomously in “island mode” while the rest of the grid is down.

As previously described, DERs are not only resources that generate electricity. Programs and innovations that manage how energy is used can also be considered a DER. Virtual power plants (VPPs) are emerging as a popular method to aggregate DERs to efficiently respond to fluctuations in energy supply and demand. VPPs use data analytics to forecast energy needs and dispatch energy from DERs to the grid accordingly. The optimized use of DERs can improve grid reliability through a cost-effective manner.",,N,,2025-10-16 19:10:16.879118

Oakland, Calif. – Oct. 16, 2025: The Port of Oakland proudly joined over 2,000 community-owned, not-for-profit electric utilities nationwide in celebrating Public Power Week, held October 5–11, 2025. Led by the American Public Power Association (APPA), this annual event honors the people and principles behind public power—reliable, affordable, and locally controlled electricity.

The Port’s Utilities division exemplifies the mission of public utilities to serve the public good. In alignment with this year’s national theme, “2,000 Utilities. One Purpose.”, the Port Utility division reaffirms its commitment to building a resilient, sustainable, and community-focused future for Oakland’s waterfront and surrounding areas.

The Port of Oakland provides utility services to both tenant-operated and Port-operated facilities supporting Aviation, Maritime, and Commercial Real Estate operations. The Port Utilities division manages the publicly owned electrical utility system, overseeing its planning, operation, and upgrades. As a municipal utility, Port Utilities procures electric power at rates approximately 40% lower than Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E), while ensuring compliance with all applicable regulations.

“Public power is about local accountability and long-term value,” said Andre Basler, Port of Oakland Director of Utilities. “At the Port’s Utilities division, we’re not driven by profits—we’re driven by purpose. That allows us to invest in clean energy, grid resilience, and economic development in ways that directly benefit our community. Public power gives us the flexibility to innovate and the responsibility to lead.”

The Utilities division promotes energy efficiency, secures renewable energy for Port utility customers—more than twice the California average—and reduces greenhouse gas emissions through low-carbon electricity contracts and participation in the Cap & Trade market. These efforts support the Port’s Zero Emissions initiative.

As a member of APPA, the Port’s utility is part of a national network serving over 49 million Americans in 2,000 towns and cities. Public power utilities consistently deliver high reliability, lower-than-average electric rates, and faster outage restoration compared to investor-owned utilities.

“Today, community-owned utilities have a timely opportunity to expand, modernize, and strengthen customer connections,” said Scott Corwin, President & CEO of the American Public Power Association. “The Port of Oakland’s dedication to service is evident in the substantial savings and reliability customers enjoy. The ability to act on this vision begins with you, and some of the greatest opportunities in decades are now within reach.”

Throughout the week, the Utilities division recognized the dedicated professionals who keep the lights on and the Port running—from engineers and field personnel to sustainability experts and customer service teams. The Port also showcased its clean energy initiatives, including plans for battery energy storage, maritime electrification, and collaborative projects with regional public power partners.

American Electric Power Transmission will upgrade power lines in Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Oklahoma and West Virginia, primarily to enhance enhance grid reliability and capacity, the Energy Department said. The project is meant to help meet surging electricity demand from data centers and artificial intelligence.

AEP said the upgrades would save customers an estimated $275 million in financing costs over the lifetime of the loan.

These projects will replace existing transmission lines with new lines that will be able to carry more energy, providing more reliability and further promoting economic growth, AEP said.

The work is expected to create 1,100 construction jobs.

“AEP is experiencing growth in energy demand that has not been seen in a generation. As the first company to close a new loan with the Trump Administration under this program, we are excited to get to work on these projects to improve the service we provide to our customers,” said Bill Fehrman, AEP chairman, president and chief executive officer. “This loan saves our customers money and improves reliability while supporting economic growth in our states. The funds we will save through this program enable us to make additional investments to enhance service for our customers.”

AEP stated energy demand has increased across its footprint, mainly due to business expansions that are expected to need an additional 24 gigawatts of electricity by 2030, AEP said. The updates are to help support data centers, artificial intelligence and manufacturing development without overloading the electric system.

The move comes as the Trump administration has moved to cancel $7.6 billion in grants that supported hundreds of clean energy projects in 16 states, all of which voted for Democrat Kamala Harris in last year’s presidential election. A total of 223 projects were terminated after a review determined they did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs or were not economically viable, the Energy Department said.

The cancellations include up to $1.2 billion for California’s hydrogen hub aimed at producing clean-burning hydrogen fuels to power ships and heavy-duty trucks. A hydrogen project costing up to $1 billion in the Pacific Northwest also was cancelled.

The loan guarantee finalized Thursday is the first offered by the Trump administration under the recently renamed Energy Dominance Financing program created by the massive tax-and-spending law approved this summer by congressional Republicans and signed by President Donald Trump. Electric utilities that receive loans through the program must provide assurances to the government that financial benefits from the financing will be passed on to customers, the Energy Department said.

The project and others being considered will help ensure that Americans ""will have access to affordable, reliable and secure energy for decades to come,” Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in a statement.

“The president has been clear: America must reverse course from the energy subtraction agenda of past administrations and strengthen our electrical grid,'' Wright said, adding that modernizing the grid and expanding transmission capacity ""will help position the United States to win the AI race and grow our manufacturing base.”

In Ohio alone, there will be 76 projects to replace 2,122 lines, according to AEP. That's expected to serve approximately 1.5 million Ohio customers. Additionally, about 100 lines in Ohio and Oklahoma have been identified to be the first set of projects to be worked on for the loan guarantee.

More than 1,400 miles in Indiana and Michigan serving 600,000 customers, the company said. An additional 1,400 miles in Oklahoma, serving about 1.2 million people and 26 miles in West Virginia, serving 460,000 people, will be replaced.

AEP said it plans to work with local communities and landowners on critical transmission lines.

The loan guarantee will save customers money and improve reliability while supporting economic growth in the five states, said Bill Fehrman, AEP's chairman, president and chief executive officer.

“The funds we will save through this program enable us to make additional investments to enhance service for our customers,"" he added.

Wright, in a conference call with reporters, distinguished the AEP loan guarantee from a $4.9 billion federal loan guarantee the department cancelled in July. That money would have boosted the planned Grain Belt Express, a new high-voltage transmission line set to deliver solar and wind-generated electricity from the Midwest to eastern states.

The Energy Department said at the time it was “not critical for the federal government to have a role” in the first phase of the $11 billion project planned by Chicago-based Invenergy. The department also questioned whether the project could meet strict financial conditions required, a claim Wright repeated Thursday.

“Ultimately that is a commercial enterprise that needs private developers,” Wright said. The company has indicated the Grain Belt project will go forward.

Trump and Wright have repeatedly derided wind and solar energy as unreliable and opposed efforts to combat climate change by moving away from fossil fuels. Wright said the Grain Belt Express loan was among billions of dollars worth of commitments “rushed out the doors” by former President Joe Biden’s administration after the 2024 election.",https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/AP_texas_powergrid_41624,N,,2025-10-16 19:11:14.150111

These projects will replace existing transmission lines with new lines that will be able to carry more energy, providing more reliability and further promoting economic growth, AEP said.
Additionally, about 100 lines in Ohio and Oklahoma have been identified to be the first set of projects to be worked on for the loan guarantee.
AEP said it plans to work with local communities and landowners on critical transmission lines.
Wright, in a conference call with reporters, distinguished the AEP loan guarantee from a $4.9 billion federal loan guarantee the department cancelled in July.","OHIO — The Department of Energy said Thursday it has finalized a $1.6 billion loan guarantee to a subsidiary of one of the nation's largest power companies to upgrade nearly 5,000 miles of transmission lines across five states, mostly in the Midwest, for largely fossil fuel-run energy.

American Electric Power Transmission will upgrade power lines in Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Oklahoma and West Virginia, primarily to enhance enhance grid reliability and capacity, the Energy Department said. The project is meant to help meet surging electricity demand from data centers and artificial intelligence.

AEP said the upgrades would save customers an estimated $275 million in financing costs over the lifetime of the loan.

These projects will replace existing transmission lines with new lines that will be able to carry more energy, providing more reliability and further promoting economic growth, AEP said.

The work is expected to create 1,100 construction jobs.

“AEP is experiencing growth in energy demand that has not been seen in a generation. As the first company to close a new loan with the Trump Administration under this program, we are excited to get to work on these projects to improve the service we provide to our customers,” said Bill Fehrman, AEP chairman, president and chief executive officer. “This loan saves our customers money and improves reliability while supporting economic growth in our states. The funds we will save through this program enable us to make additional investments to enhance service for our customers.”

AEP stated energy demand has increased across its footprint, mainly due to business expansions that are expected to need an additional 24 gigawatts of electricity by 2030, AEP said. The updates are to help support data centers, artificial intelligence and manufacturing development without overloading the electric system.

The move comes as the Trump administration has moved to cancel $7.6 billion in grants that supported hundreds of clean energy projects in 16 states, all of which voted for Democrat Kamala Harris in last year’s presidential election. A total of 223 projects were terminated after a review determined they did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs or were not economically viable, the Energy Department said.

The cancellations include up to $1.2 billion for California’s hydrogen hub aimed at producing clean-burning hydrogen fuels to power ships and heavy-duty trucks. A hydrogen project costing up to $1 billion in the Pacific Northwest also was cancelled.

The loan guarantee finalized Thursday is the first offered by the Trump administration under the recently renamed Energy Dominance Financing program created by the massive tax-and-spending law approved this summer by congressional Republicans and signed by President Donald Trump. Electric utilities that receive loans through the program must provide assurances to the government that financial benefits from the financing will be passed on to customers, the Energy Department said.

The project and others being considered will help ensure that Americans ""will have access to affordable, reliable and secure energy for decades to come,” Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in a statement.

“The president has been clear: America must reverse course from the energy subtraction agenda of past administrations and strengthen our electrical grid,'' Wright said, adding that modernizing the grid and expanding transmission capacity ""will help position the United States to win the AI race and grow our manufacturing base.”

In Ohio alone, there will be 76 projects to replace 2,122 lines, according to AEP. That's expected to serve approximately 1.5 million Ohio customers. Additionally, about 100 lines in Ohio and Oklahoma have been identified to be the first set of projects to be worked on for the loan guarantee.

More than 1,400 miles in Indiana and Michigan serving 600,000 customers, the company said. An additional 1,400 miles in Oklahoma, serving about 1.2 million people and 26 miles in West Virginia, serving 460,000 people, will be replaced.

AEP said it plans to work with local communities and landowners on critical transmission lines.

The loan guarantee will save customers money and improve reliability while supporting economic growth in the five states, said Bill Fehrman, AEP's chairman, president and chief executive officer.

“The funds we will save through this program enable us to make additional investments to enhance service for our customers,"" he added.

Wright, in a conference call with reporters, distinguished the AEP loan guarantee from a $4.9 billion federal loan guarantee the department cancelled in July. That money would have boosted the planned Grain Belt Express, a new high-voltage transmission line set to deliver solar and wind-generated electricity from the Midwest to eastern states.

The Energy Department said at the time it was “not critical for the federal government to have a role” in the first phase of the $11 billion project planned by Chicago-based Invenergy. The department also questioned whether the project could meet strict financial conditions required, a claim Wright repeated Thursday.

“Ultimately that is a commercial enterprise that needs private developers,” Wright said. The company has indicated the Grain Belt project will go forward.

Trump and Wright have repeatedly derided wind and solar energy as unreliable and opposed efforts to combat climate change by moving away from fossil fuels. Wright said the Grain Belt Express loan was among billions of dollars worth of commitments “rushed out the doors” by former President Joe Biden’s administration after the 2024 election.",https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/AP_texas_powergrid_41624,N,,2025-10-16 16:10:33.507022

FAQ: Arizona Copper Mine Reopening Which Companies Are Leading Arizona Copper Mine Reopening Efforts?","The convergence of federal policy changes, surging copper prices, and supply chain vulnerabilities has created an unprecedented opportunity for reopening copper mines in Arizona. Mining executives are increasingly viewing dormant Arizona operations as strategic assets rather than stranded investments, particularly as domestic mineral security becomes a national priority. Furthermore, copper price insights indicate sustained bullish sentiment supporting these reopening initiatives.

Arizona's established mining infrastructure provides a compelling advantage over greenfield developments. The state's 150-year mining heritage has created a foundation of processing facilities, transportation networks, and skilled workforce populations that can be reactivated rather than built from scratch. This infrastructure advantage becomes particularly valuable when considering the 7-12 year development timelines typical for new mining projects.

The Perfect Storm Driving Mine Reopening Decisions

Federal policy realignment under the Trump administration represents what industry leaders characterize as a fundamental critical minerals policy shift for the mining sector, prioritising domestic production capabilities and supply chain security. The designation of copper as a critical mineral under federal guidelines has streamlined permitting processes and introduced tax incentives specifically targeting domestic production capabilities.

Copper price trajectories have reached multi-year highs, with the London Metal Exchange reflecting sustained demand growth driven by global electrification initiatives. The International Energy Agency projects a 24% increase in copper demand by 2035, creating supply-demand imbalances that favour reopening copper mines in Arizona over waiting for new discoveries.

Supply chain disruptions exposed during recent global events have highlighted the risks of import dependency. Currently, the United States relies on imports for approximately 40% of its copper needs, with Chile, Canada, and Mexico serving as primary suppliers. This dependency creates strategic vulnerabilities that domestic production can help mitigate.

Arizona's Dominant Position in U.S. Copper Production

Metric Arizona National Context Share of U.S. Production 70% Leading state Active Major Operations 6+ mines Morenci, Sierrita, Miami Historical Significance 150+ years Continuous mining heritage Infrastructure Status Established Processing facilities, transport corridors

Arizona's dominance in American copper production stems from geological advantages and decades of infrastructure development. The state's major operations including Freeport-McMoRan's Morenci mine, South32's Sierrita operation, and KGHM International's Miami facility provide a foundation for supporting additional production capacity through reopened facilities. In addition, modern mining technology enables these facilities to achieve higher efficiency standards than historical operations.

Which Shuttered Arizona Copper Mines Are Being Considered for Reopening?

BHP is actively evaluating four shuttered copper mines in Arizona's Globe-Miami region, including the historic Magma mine acquired in 1996. This strategic review encompasses not only the mines themselves but also the potential for reprocessing tailings from historical operations to extract additional copper using modern technologies.

The Globe-Miami mining district offers unique advantages for reopening projects, including existing processing infrastructure, established transportation corridors via State Route 60, and proximity to skilled mining professionals. These factors significantly reduce the capital requirements and timeline compared to developing entirely new operations.

Globe-Miami Region: The Historic Mining Corridor Revival

The Magma mine operated continuously from 1910 to 1996, producing over 12 billion pounds of copper during its operational lifetime. The facility's 29-year idle status presents both challenges and opportunities, as modern extraction technologies can potentially recover copper from previously uneconomical ore grades and historical tailings.

Legacy operations in the Globe-Miami region benefit from proven ore reserves and geological data spanning decades of production. This historical knowledge base reduces exploration risk and provides detailed understanding of ore body characteristics, mineralisation patterns, and optimal extraction methods.

Transportation infrastructure remains intact throughout the mining corridor, with established rail access and highway connections facilitating movement of concentrate to processing facilities. The region's proximity to major population centres also ensures availability of skilled workforce and support services.

Resolution Copper: The Game-Changing Development Project

Resolution Copper represents one of the largest undeveloped copper deposits in North America, containing approximately 1.8 billion metric tons of ore with an average grade of 1.5% copper, potentially supplying 25% of total U.S. copper demand once operational.

The Resolution Copper project operates as a joint venture between Rio Tinto (55%) and BHP (45%), formed in 2004 to develop deposits located near Superior, Arizona. This partnership combines international mining expertise with domestic market knowledge to advance one of North America's most significant undeveloped copper resources.

The project entered a new development phase in 2023, with environmental impact assessment processes ongoing. However, the timeline faces regulatory complexities related to federal land exchanges and environmental compliance requirements that could extend development schedules.

Economic impact projections suggest Resolution Copper could generate substantial revenue for Arizona communities and state coffers once operational. The scale of the deposit positions it as a cornerstone project for American copper self-sufficiency initiatives.

What Economic Factors Make Arizona Mine Reopening Financially Viable?

Mine reopening projects offer compelling economic advantages over greenfield development, requiring 40-60% less capital investment due to existing infrastructure and proven reserves. This cost differential becomes particularly significant in current capital markets where mining project financing faces increased scrutiny and higher interest rates.

Timeline advantages provide additional economic benefits, as reopening projects can achieve production within 2-4 years compared to 7-12 years for new developments. This compressed timeline reduces financing costs and allows producers to capitalise on current favourable commodity price environments.

Copper Market Fundamentals Supporting Investment Decisions

Global electrification initiatives are driving unprecedented copper demand growth, with renewable energy infrastructure requiring significantly more copper per unit of electricity generation compared to traditional fossil fuel systems. Consequently, surging copper demand creates favourable conditions for reopening dormant facilities.

Supply-demand imbalances have created sustained price support for copper, with global mine supply facing deficits beginning in 2025-2026 as new project development lags behind demand growth. These market fundamentals provide revenue stability for reopening investments.

Treatment and refining charge markets reflect tight concentrate supply conditions. Japan, Spain, and South Korea issued joint warnings about plunging treatment charges, with some Chinese smelters processing copper at zero or negative rates, indicating severe supply constraints that benefit concentrate producers.

Premium pricing for domestically sourced critical minerals adds additional revenue potential for Arizona operations. National security considerations and supply chain resilience initiatives create market premiums for domestic copper supplies.

Cost-Benefit Analysis of Reopening vs. New Development

Factor Mine Reopening Greenfield Development Initial Capital 40-60% lower Full development costs Timeline to Production 2-4 years 7-12 years Infrastructure Costs Existing/Upgradeable Complete new build Permitting Complexity Streamlined process Full environmental review Resource Risk Proven reserves Exploration dependent Workforce Availability Established communities New recruitment required

Infrastructure rehabilitation costs represent the primary capital requirement for reopening projects, involving structural assessments of shafts, hoists, and underground workings. However, these costs remain substantially lower than complete facility construction required for greenfield developments.

Equipment procurement represents a significant consideration, with major mining equipment currently facing 18-24 month delivery timelines due to global supply chain constraints. However, some reopening projects may utilise refurbished equipment or benefit from existing machinery stored at facility sites.

How Are Policy Changes Accelerating Arizona Copper Mine Development?

The Trump administration's approach to critical minerals represents what industry executives describe as a breathtaking shift for the mining sector, prioritising domestic production capabilities and supply chain security. This policy realignment has created regulatory frameworks specifically designed to support domestic copper production initiatives.

Federal critical minerals strategy implementation includes expedited permitting processes for domestic copper projects, reducing typical NEPA review timelines that historically required 7-10 years for major mining operations. These streamlined processes specifically target projects that enhance domestic supply capabilities.

Federal Critical Minerals Strategy Impact

Copper's designation on the U.S. Geological Survey's list of 50 critical minerals deemed essential to economic and national security has established regulatory frameworks prioritising domestic production. This designation provides access to expedited review processes and federal support programmes.

Tax incentives through the Inflation Reduction Act include Advanced Manufacturing Production Credits specifically applicable to domestic critical mineral production. These incentives improve project economics by reducing effective tax rates for qualifying operations.

National security considerations have elevated copper to strategic mineral status, creating policy frameworks that view domestic production as essential infrastructure rather than purely commercial activity. This shift influences regulatory decision-making and resource allocation priorities.

State-Level Support Mechanisms

Arizona's mining-friendly regulatory environment provides additional advantages for reopening projects, with established frameworks for permitting and environmental compliance that complement federal initiatives. The state's experience with mining regulation reduces bureaucratic uncertainties common in other jurisdictions.

Workforce development programmes specifically target skilled mining positions, addressing labour shortages that could constrain production expansion. These programmes coordinate with educational institutions and industry partners to ensure adequate skilled workforce availability.

Infrastructure investment commitments at state and local levels support mining operations through improved transportation networks, utility capacity, and communication systems. These investments reduce operational costs and improve project viability.

What Modern Technologies Are Enabling Sustainable Mine Reopening?

Advanced extraction and processing technologies have fundamentally transformed the economics of mine reopening by enabling recovery of copper from previously uneconomical ore grades and historical waste materials. These technological improvements make idle facilities viable under current market conditions.

Automated mining systems reduce operational costs by 15-20% while improving worker safety by removing personnel from hazardous underground environments. These systems also provide more precise extraction capabilities, maximising ore recovery rates and reducing waste generation.

Advanced Extraction and Processing Methods

Modern flotation and leaching technologies can economically extract copper from historical tailings with grades as low as 0.15-0.20%, compared to 0.40%+ required by older technologies. This capability transforms historical waste into valuable resources, extending mine life and improving project economics.

Tailings reprocessing capabilities offer additional revenue streams for reopened operations, utilising existing waste materials that previous mining activities left behind. Advanced processing methods can extract not only copper but also precious metals and other valuable minerals from these materials.

Improved ore processing technologies maximise recovery rates from primary mining activities, ensuring more complete extraction of valuable minerals from processed ore. These improvements reduce waste generation and increase revenue per ton of ore processed.

Environmental Management and Water Conservation

Modern copper mining operations in Arizona utilise advanced water recycling systems that can reduce freshwater consumption by up to 85% compared to traditional methods, addressing critical environmental concerns in arid regions.

Closed-loop water systems minimise environmental impact by recycling process water through multiple treatment stages, reducing freshwater requirements and eliminating liquid waste discharge. Furthermore, South32's Sierrita operation near Tucson demonstrates this technology's effectiveness, recovering over 80% of process water.

Renewable energy integration provides operational cost reduction and environmental benefits, with several Arizona copper mines deploying solar power installations. Freeport-McMoRan's Bagdad mine implemented a 65-megawatt solar facility in 2024, demonstrating renewable energy viability for large-scale mining operations.

Land reclamation technologies enable restoration of post-mining landscapes to productive uses, addressing environmental concerns whilst creating long-term community benefits. These technologies transform former mining areas into recreational facilities, wildlife habitat, or agricultural land.

What Timeline Should Investors Expect for Arizona Copper Mine Reopening?

Mine reopening projects typically require comprehensive evaluation phases before production decisions, with feasibility studies and resource confirmation drilling representing initial milestones. These studies assess infrastructure condition, ore reserve viability, and regulatory requirements.

BHP's evaluation of four Globe-Miami region mines represents early-stage analysis that could extend 12-18 months before final reopening decisions. These assessments must address 29 years of facility idleness and evaluate infrastructure modernisation requirements.

How Will Reopened Arizona Mines Impact Global Copper Supply Chains?

Domestic copper production expansion through reopening copper mines in Arizona directly addresses import dependency issues that create strategic vulnerabilities for American manufacturing and infrastructure development. Current import levels of approximately 40% represent significant exposure to international supply disruptions and geopolitical tensions.

The combined market value of the world's 50 most valuable mining companies reached nearly $2 trillion in Q3 2025, reflecting strong investor interest in copper and critical mineral producers. This valuation growth demonstrates market confidence in long-term demand fundamentals supporting reopening investments.

Reducing Import Dependency and Geopolitical Risk

Arizona mine reopening creates strategic buffer capacity against international supply disruptions, reducing reliance on imports from politically unstable regions. Recent geopolitical tensions have highlighted risks associated with concentrated supply chains and foreign dependency for critical materials.

Strengthening North American copper supply security supports regional economic integration and reduces transportation costs associated with intercontinental shipping. Domestic production also eliminates currency exchange risks and trade policy uncertainties affecting international purchases.

Chinese copper export activity reflects tight global supply conditions, with smelters shipping up to 50,000 tons to international warehouses as record London prices create arbitrage opportunities. This activity demonstrates global supply chain stress that domestic production can help alleviate.

Supporting Domestic Manufacturing and Clean Energy Transition

Local copper availability supports domestic renewable energy infrastructure development by reducing material costs and ensuring supply reliability for solar installations, wind turbines, and electric vehicle charging networks. These applications require substantially more copper than traditional energy systems.

Reduced transportation costs benefit domestic manufacturers by eliminating international shipping expenses and delivery uncertainties. However, US copper project insights suggest that local copper supplies also provide more responsive delivery schedules and flexible ordering arrangements compared to international suppliers.

Job creation across the mining and processing value chain extends beyond direct mining employment to include transportation, equipment supply, professional services, and community support activities. These economic multiplier effects provide regional development benefits.

What Challenges Could Delay Arizona Copper Mine Reopening Projects?

Regulatory complexity remains a significant challenge for mine reopening projects, despite policy changes intended to streamline processes. Federal land use approvals and environmental compliance requirements must address current standards that may differ significantly from historical operational permits.

Water rights allocation represents a critical constraint in Arizona's arid environment, where historic mining operations may hold existing rights but reactivation requires state regulatory approval under prior appropriation water law. Competition for limited water resources creates potential delays and cost increases.

Regulatory and Environmental Hurdles

Environmental compliance requirements for reopened mines must address current Clean Water Act, Clean Air Act, and NEPA standards that often require significant upgrades from historical operational practices. These upgrades can substantially increase reopening costs and timeline requirements.

Community relations and stakeholder engagement processes have become more complex since many Arizona mines originally operated, requiring extensive consultation and benefit-sharing arrangements. Resolution Copper's extended permitting process demonstrates these challenges' potential impact on project timelines.

Federal land use approvals involve multiple agencies and complex procedures, particularly for projects requiring land exchanges or modifications to existing federal land designations. These processes can extend regulatory timelines beyond initial projections.

Technical and Financial Risk Factors

Mine reopening projects face unique challenges including ageing infrastructure assessment, updated safety compliance, and workforce recruitment in competitive labour markets where experienced mining professionals command premium compensation.

Infrastructure modernisation costs can escalate significantly when detailed engineering assessments reveal extensive rehabilitation requirements for facilities idle for 25-30 years. Underground workings may face groundwater infiltration, roof deterioration, and equipment corrosion requiring major investments.

Skilled workforce availability presents challenges in competitive labour markets where experienced mining professionals have multiple employment opportunities. Training programmes require 6-12 months to develop operational competency, potentially constraining production ramp-up schedules.

Capital market conditions affect project financing availability and costs, with current higher interest rates increasing project financing expenses. M&A activity in the mining sector remains sluggish due to high valuations and operational setbacks, potentially limiting financing options.

Equipment availability and delivery timelines create project scheduling challenges, with major mining equipment facing 18-24 month procurement periods. Supply chain constraints affecting mining equipment manufacturers could extend these timelines further.

FAQ: Arizona Copper Mine Reopening

Which Companies Are Leading Arizona Copper Mine Reopening Efforts?

BHP is actively evaluating four shuttered mines in Arizona's Globe-Miami region, including the historic Magma mine acquired in 1996. The company's strategy encompasses both facility reopening and tailings reprocessing to maximise domestic copper production capabilities.

Resolution Copper, a joint venture between Rio Tinto (55%) and BHP (45%), represents another major development initiative, though focused on new deposit development rather than reopening copper mines in Arizona. This project involves one of North America's largest undeveloped copper deposits.

Major mining companies including Freeport-McMoRan, South32, and KGHM International continue operating existing Arizona facilities whilst evaluating expansion opportunities that could include reopening adjacent shuttered operations.

How Long Does It Take to Reopen a Shuttered Copper Mine?

Typical reopening timelines range from 2-5 years depending on infrastructure condition, regulatory requirements, and market conditions. Projects involving facilities idle for extended periods may require longer timelines due to extensive rehabilitation needs.

Infrastructure assessment phases typically require 6-12 months to evaluate structural integrity, equipment condition, and modernisation requirements. These assessments determine rehabilitation scope and cost estimates for final investment decisions.

Regulatory approval processes can extend 12-24 months, though streamlined procedures for critical mineral projects may reduce these timelines. Environmental compliance requirements often represent the longest component of regulatory review processes.

Equipment procurement and installation phases typically require 18-24 months due to current supply chain constraints affecting mining equipment manufacturers. Major processing equipment may require longer delivery periods depending on customisation requirements.

What Environmental Protections Apply to Reopened Copper Mines?

Modern reopening projects must comply with current environmental standards regardless of historical operational practices, often requiring significant upgrades to meet Clean Water Act, Clean Air Act, and waste management regulations.

Comprehensive environmental management plans address water usage, air emissions, waste handling, and land reclamation requirements. These plans must demonstrate compliance with current regulatory standards and incorporate modern environmental protection technologies.

Water management systems require closed-loop recycling capabilities that can achieve 85% water recycling rates, significantly reducing freshwater consumption compared to historical operations. Advanced treatment systems eliminate liquid waste discharge to surrounding environments.

Reclamation bonding requirements ensure adequate financial resources for post-mining land restoration activities. These bonds must reflect current reclamation costs and environmental protection standards rather than historical requirements.

The federal EV tax credit era has officially ended, but the shift toward electric vehicles is far from over.","(Post-September 2025 Update for U.S. and Colorado Drivers)

The electric vehicle (EV) landscape in the U.S. has changed dramatically over the past few months. As of September 30, 2025, the federal EV tax credit program officially expired, ending a decade-long incentive that helped millions of Americans make the switch to electric.

But all is not lost — many state and local incentives, including those in Colorado, are still available to help soften the price of going electric. Here’s where things stand now.

The Federal EV Tax Credit Has Ended

For years, the Clean Vehicle Credit (under Section 30D of the IRS code) provided up to $7,500 toward the purchase of new electric or plug-in hybrid vehicles that met specific assembly, battery, and pricing requirements.

However, under the phase-out provisions passed earlier this year, the program officially ended for vehicles acquired after September 30, 2025. Only buyers who entered into a binding purchase contract with a deposit before that date are eligible to still claim the credit on their 2025 tax return.

Here’s what that means:

No new federal tax credits are available for EVs purchased on or after October 1, 2025.

The used clean vehicle credit (worth up to $4,000) has also expired.

The home EV charger credit remains available through June 30, 2026, providing up to 30% of installation costs (up to $1,000) for home charging equipment.

Some automakers may still offer lease-based incentives that mimic federal credits, since in certain cases the manufacturer (as the lessor) can claim the credit and pass the savings on through reduced lease payments.

Colorado Steps Up: State EV Incentives in 2025–2026

Colorado has long been one of the most EV-friendly states in the country — and that continues even as federal incentives fade.

Current Colorado EV Tax Credits (as of Fall 2025)

$3,500 state income tax credit for new electric vehicles purchased or leased in 2025.

An additional $2,500 bonus credit for vehicles with an MSRP under $35,000.

The credit can be assigned to your dealer or finance company at the time of sale, allowing the savings to be applied upfront as a discount instead of waiting until tax season.

Buyers who assign the credit also qualify for a $600 “assignment bonus.”

These credits apply to new vehicles only, though Colorado has separate programs and grants for commercial EVs and fleet conversions.

What’s Changing Soon

Colorado’s state EV credit is set to decrease again in 2026:

Expected to drop to $1,500 for most EVs.

The bonus for lower-priced models may continue, but likely at a reduced rate.

That means 2025 represents the final high-value year for state incentives — and with federal credits gone, the Colorado credit is now one of the best in the nation.

Other Colorado EV Incentives Still in Play

In addition to the state tax credit, there are still a few other incentives worth noting:

Property Tax Exemption: EV charging stations are exempt from property tax until January 1, 2030.

Utility Rebates: Many electric utilities — including Xcel Energy and Platte River Power Authority — continue to offer rebates for EV chargers or time-of-use rate discounts for EV owners.

Local Grants: Some municipalities, including Denver and Boulder, provide additional rebates or free public charging programs.

What Colorado EV Buyers Should Know Going Forward

Even without federal help, buying an EV in Colorado still comes with tangible financial benefits — but the window for maximum savings is closing fast.

Here’s how to make the most of it:

Buy before 2026 to capture the full $3,500–$6,000 in state incentives.

Ask your dealer about credit assignment so you can see the discount immediately on your purchase agreement.

Check utility and local programs — some stackable rebates can add another few hundred dollars in savings.

Keep an eye on future legislation: both state and federal policymakers are considering successor programs aimed at boosting EV adoption, especially in rural and middle-income markets.

The federal EV tax credit era has officially ended, but the shift toward electric vehicles is far from over. Colorado continues to reward EV buyers with strong incentives, especially for more affordable models.If you’ve been on the fence about going electric, late 2025 may be your last, best opportunity to take advantage of significant savings before next year’s reductions kick in.

As the tax credit’s loss starts to take effect, car companies that have long relied on the $7,500 credit to create sales for themselves are starting to adjust their strategies for sales and their overall transition to electrification.

On Tuesday, General Motors announced it would include a $1.6 billion charge in its upcoming quarterly earnings results from its EV investments.

Ford said in late September that it expects demand for its EVs to be cut in half. Stellantis is abandoning its plan to have only EVs being produced in Europe by 2030, and Chrysler, a brand under the Stellantis umbrella, is bailing on lofty EV sales targets here in the U.S.

How Tesla could benefit from the ‘Big Beautiful Bill’ that axes EV subsidies

Advertisement

The tax credit and EV subsidies have achieved what many of us believed they were doing: masking car companies from the truth about their EV demand. Simply put, their products are not priced attractively enough for what they offer, and there is no true advantage to buying EVs developed by legacy companies.

These tax credits have helped companies simply compete with Tesla, nothing more and nothing less. Without them, their products likely would not have done as well as they have. That’s why these companies are now suddenly backtracking.

It’s something Elon Musk has said all along.

Back in January, during the Q4 and Full Year 2024 Earnings Call, Musk said:

“I think it would be devastating for our competitors and for Tesla slightly. But, long term, it probably actually helps Tesla, that would be my guess.”

Over the past few years, Tesla has started to lose its market share in the U.S., mostly because more companies have entered the EV manufacturing market and more models are being offered.

Nobody has been able to make a sizeable dent in what Tesla has done, and although its market share has gotten smaller, it still holds nearly half of all EV sales in the U.S.

Tesla’s EV Market Share in the U.S. By Year

2020 – 79%

2021 – 72%

2022 – 62%

2023 – 55%

2024 – 49%

As others are adjusting to what they believe will be tempered demand for their EVs, Tesla has just reported its strongest quarter in company history, with just shy of half a million deliveries.

Will Tesla thrive without the EV tax credit? Five reasons why they might

Although Tesla benefited from the EV tax credit, particularly last quarter, some believe it will have a small impact since it has been lost. The company has many other focuses, with its main priority appearing to be autonomy and AI.

One thing is for sure: Musk was right.

Elon Musk has admitted that X’s creator payout system isn’t living up to expectations, and he has highlighted the current system’s biggest flaw.

Amidst complaints about low and inconsistent payments, the platform’s owner acknowledged that X has been “underpaying and not allocating payment accurately enough.” Musk also stated that YouTube manages creator payments “much better.”

Musk acknowledges payout issues

Recent discussions about the social media platform’s payout issues began when X product head Nikita Bier stated that the company was developing new upgrades for “power users.” This prompted X user Peter Duan to raise ongoing concerns about being “consistently underpaid” compared to his peers. Bier responded candidly, suggesting that “creator payouts do more harm than good and we need to off-ramp to a different system.”

Musk then weighed in on the matter, contradicting Bier’s view. “No,” Musk wrote in his reply, “the issue is that we are underpaying and not allocating payment accurately enough. YouTube does a much better job.” The Tesla CEO’s comment immediately reignited debates about X’s monetization program, which some have criticized for its rather unpredictable nature.

X’s monetization challenges

Since X launched its ad revenue-sharing program in 2023, the system has promised to reward Premium subscribers who generate high engagement with verified accounts, as noted in a WION report. Creators, however, have argued that the company’s payout model has remained inconsistent, with revenue fluctuating even when view counts stay stable. Reports have noted that some users with millions of monthly impressions have received just a few hundred dollars.

By contrast, YouTube’s Partner Program, which takes a 45% cut of ad revenue, is known for more transparent and predictable payments. Musk’s admission that YouTube handles monetization more effectively could then hint at a potential shift towards a new monetization program for X, a platform that has become increasingly critical to social conversations over the years.

Tesla has made a last-ditch effort to secure the $56 billion pay package for CEO Elon Musk, which was approved twice by company shareholders, after a Delaware Chancery Court denied the frontman the payday.

Perhaps one of the biggest issues from a standpoint of being fluent in Tesla-related events has been Musk’s pay package.

It was approved by shareholders once in 2018, and required Musk to oversee various growth tranches that would bring investors value. He completed each of the tranches and was entitled to the pay package.

However, the Delaware Chancery Court decided in January 2024 to rescind the pay package, which Musk had earned, based on a suit filed by a shareholder.

Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick ruled that Tesla’s board lacked independence from Musk when the pay package was approved in 2018, and that it should not be granted.

She called it “an unfathomable sum.”

In response to the pay package’s rejection by Chancellor McCormick, Tesla held a second shareholder vote last year, which once again showed investors were willing to support Musk’s payday. It was approved by shareholders, but it was once again denied by the court.

Today, Tesla attorneys argued to the Delaware Supreme Court that the pay package should be restored because of last year’s vote by shareholders.

Jeffrey Wall, an attorney for Tesla, said (via Reuters):

“This was the most informed stockholder vote in Delaware history. Reaffirming that would resolve this case. Shareholders in 2024 knew exactly what they were voting.”

In a response to the decision by the Delaware courts last year, Tesla proposed a new pay package for Musk in September, which would give him a potentially $1 trillion compensation plan. It would require Musk to help Tesla reach several performance-based growth milestones, including achieving an $8.5 trillion market cap.

Elon Musk’s new pay plan ties trillionaire status to Tesla’s $8.5 trillion valuation

Musk is currently worth $483 billion, making him the richest person in the world. If he were to achieve his pay package tranches, granted the new pay package is passed at the Shareholder Meeting in November, he would easily be the first trillionaire.",https://www.teslarati.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/elon-musk-1-1000x600.jpg,N,,2025-10-16 18:08:37.789750

The current budget impasse is the result of Democratic insistence that the expanded subsidies be extended and Republican insistence that the expanded subsidies expire as scheduled.
If the enhanced subsidies expire, the cap on insurance premium payments as a percentage of income will rise.
Of that, more than $50 billion would go to households with incomes greater than 500% of the federal poverty level.
Considering the large number of Republican voters who would be hurt if the subsidies expire, one would think there is a compromise to be had.","Income-based subsidies have been part of the Affordable Care Act from the beginning. These subsidies take the form of tax credits designed to make health insurance premiums more affordable for low- and middle-income Americans.

During the COVID shutdowns, these subsidies were expanded to cover more people and enhanced to provide greater benefits. These temporary measures were part of the American Rescue Plan of 2021 and the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. The extra subsidies expire at the end of this year.

The current budget impasse is the result of Democratic insistence that the expanded subsidies be extended and Republican insistence that the expanded subsidies expire as scheduled.

So what exactly are these subsidies, and who gets them?

Two factors are involved. The first is income as a percentage of the federal poverty level. According to health policy nonprofit KFF, enhanced subsidies are available to individuals with household incomes up to 415% of the federal poverty level ($65,000 per year) and families of four with household incomes up to 404% of the federal poverty level ($130,000 per year).

The second factor is the cap on insurance premium payments as a percentage of household income. For individuals and families of four with incomes below 141% of the federal poverty level, enhanced tax credits reduce their premium costs to zero. The net cost increases as income increases topping out at 8.5% of income for those at 400% of the federal poverty level.

If the enhanced subsidies expire, the cap on insurance premium payments as a percentage of income will rise. Instead of paying zero, those earning 115% to 120% of the federal poverty level will pay 2.1% of income in premiums. Individuals and families of four with the highest qualifying incomes will pay 10% rather than 8.5%. Some who currently qualify will be ineligible for subsidies.

All told, the Congressional Budget Office estimates that extending the subsidies would cost $350 billion over the next 10 years. Of that, more than $50 billion would go to households with incomes greater than 500% of the federal poverty level.

As part of its analysis, the Congressional Budget Office presented a series of alternatives short of a full extension that would reduce the 10-year cost.

The debate over the Affordable Care Act extension is a topsy-turvy throwback to the debate earlier this year over the “Big Beautiful Bill.” Back then, the 2017 Trump tax cuts were due to expire at the end of 2026. Extending the tax cuts would increase the budget deficit by $4.5 trillion over the ensuing 10 years. Even though these tax cuts primarily benefited those with higher incomes, the Republicans pushed the BBB over the line.

Now that the issue is $350 billion in tax credits that would primarily go to those with lower incomes, Republicans are digging in their heels out of a supposed concern for fiscal rectitude. Meanwhile, Democrats who opposed the BBB because it mostly benefited the wealthy do not seem to be able to muster any nuance with regard to the way some of the Affordable Care Act subsidies go to those with relatively high incomes.

Considering the large number of Republican voters who would be hurt if the subsidies expire, one would think there is a compromise to be had.

One would think.

Spanish engineering firm Técnicas Reunidas and Chinese energy utility Sinopec have been awarded a front-end engineering design contract

The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has been an energy giant in the global arena and, through its vast amount of natural resources developed into a nation that looks like something out of a futuristic sci-fi novel. The megastructures and economic boom in the Kingdom brought standards of living up and positioned investors in the energy sector to make exceedingly large profits.

However, as the global energy industry has shifted towards the renewable energy sector, the oil-rich nations of the world need to foster a more balanced approach. Saudi Arabia is leading the region in that regard, following the announcement that Spanish engineering firm Técnicas Reunidas, in partnership with Chinese energy firm Sinopec, will design and construct what could be a landmark hydrogen and ammonia facility.

The contract was awarded to the consortium by ACWA Power. The facility will become the largest of its kind in the world and positions the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia as a global leader in the adoption and implementation of renewable energy projects.

Saudi Arabia has extensive experience in the efficient commissioning of energy projects that transform the global energy sector’s priorities, leading the charge for more renewable energy projects to become the norm.

Once construction has been completed, the value of the facility will skyrocket to astonishing levels

It has become evident that Saudi Arabia is aiming to lead the global clean energy export sector through innovative green hydrogen and ammonia projects. The facility will boast the production of 400,000 tons of green hydrogen annually.

Sinopec will handle the FEED (Front-end engineering and design) phase, which is set to last approximately 10 months. After that, the Técnicas Reunidas-Sinopec consortium is expected to present the Saudi government with an Engineering, Procurement, and Construction (EPC) proposal that could be worth billions of dollars.

The commissioning of the facility is set for 2030; once that takes place, it will position the Kingdom as a leader in the global hydrogen export sector. Other nations like India have also seen biomass-to-hydrogen projects being commissioned recently. The Kingdom’s Energy Minister has delivered a statement that notes his nation’s stance towards the renewable energy sector.

Both Democrats attempted to curb sales of coal from public lands, only to have those policies reversed by Trump.
Three other coal lease sales from public lands under Trump were successful.","Billings, Mont. – Federal officials rejected a mining company’s bid for 1.3 million tons of coal beneath a national forest in Utah, marking the third proposed coal sale from public lands in the West to fall through this month.

The failed sales mark a setback in President Donald Trump’s push to revive a coal mining industry that’s been in decline for almost two decades.

The Interior Department rejected the sole bid it received for coal on a proposed 120-acre (49-hectare) lease on the Manti-La Sal National Forest near central Utah’s Skyline Mine because it did not meet the requirements of the Mineral Leasing Act, agency spokesperson Alyse Sharpe said Thursday.

The leasing act requires companies to pay fair market value for coal mined on public lands. Sharpe declined to say how much was bid. The sale was requested by a subsidiary of Utah mining company Wolverine Fuels LLC, which operates the Skyline Mine and other coal mines in central Utah.

Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said two weeks ago that the government will open 13 million acres of federal lands for coal mining. But it’s unclear who would want that fuel as utilities turn to cheaper natural gas and renewables such as wind and solar to generate electricity.

Emissions from burning coal are a leading driver of climate change that’s raising sea levels and making weather more extreme.

On Oct. 6, a coal sale from public lands in Montana that would have been the largest by the government in more than a decade drew a single bid of $186,000, or about one-tenth of a penny per ton of coal, and was later rejected. That lease held 167 million tons of coal in southeastern Montana near the Navajo Transition Energy Co.'s Spring Creek mine.

Two days later the Interior Department postponed an even bigger sale – 440 million tons next to the Navajo Nation-owned company's Antelope Mine in Wyoming.

Sharpe repeated the Republican Trump administration's assertion that the policies of former Presidents Joe Biden and Barack Obama were to blame for the failed sales, saying the Democrats tried ""to dismantle domestic production and shake investor confidence in the industry.""

Both Democrats attempted to curb sales of coal from public lands, only to have those policies reversed by Trump.

Three other coal lease sales from public lands under Trump were successful. The largest, in Alabama, involved 54 million tons of coal used in steelmaking that sold last month for $46 million, or about 87 cents per ton. Two recent sales in North Dakota of leases containing a combined 30 million tons of coal brought in $186,000 total, or less than a penny per ton.

“As demand for reliable, dispatchable power grows, coal remains a critical component of ensuring affordable and dependable energy for the American people,” Sharpe said in a statement.

But industry analysts and economists say the biggest driver of coal's retreat has been market forces that make other fuels more economical. Many power plants served by large mines on public lands in the West are nearing retirement.

Environmentalists have fought for years against the expansion of Utah's Skyline Mine. Emma Yip with the Center for Biological Diversity described the bid rejection as “yet another face-plant for the Trump administration"" as it tries to prop up a dying industry.

“Coal is among the dirtiest energy sources on Earth and burning it continues to sicken and kill Americans. There’s no defensible reason to keep it on life support when absolutely nobody wants it,” Yip said.","https://www.detroitnews.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/10/16/PDTN/86729712007-ap-25188721833067.jpg?crop=3065,1724,x0,y818&width=3065&height=1724&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-10-16 15:08:53.079426

Cleve Hill was granted development consent by the Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy in May 2020.

The Clevel Hill Solar Park is now operating at full capacity and exporting energy at 100%

The world has been consumed by the current transition away from the non-renewable energy sector towards projects like Clevel Hill that accelerate the global transition to the renewable energy sector. Projects across the world are popping up that strengthen the prominence of wind power in the global energy industry.

Cleve Hill serves as a landmark achievement for the UK energy sector. It was the first project of its kind that was consented as a Nationally Significant Infrastructure Project (“NSIP”). The site’s contractor, Quinbrook Infrastructure Partners, has announced the successful completion of construction and has noted that operations on site are underway.

The site’s 373 MW capacity is more than four times the size of the next largest operational UK solar project. Cleve Hill is supported by the largest solar and battery storage project financing in UK history. Quinbrook, the site’s operator, received a GBP 218.5 million term loan and a GBP 20 million VAT facility with Lloyds and NatWest, which exemplifies the nation’s cooperative approach to the solar sector.

“Cleve Hill sets a new benchmark for large-scale solar projects to help decarbonise the UK power system and demonstrates how investing in the infrastructure needed to transition the UK to clean energy can support local communities and create new jobs. The UK’s ongoing commitment to progress its energy transition and decarbonise the economy represents a strong conviction as a nation to a renewable energy future, one that is underpinned by a huge pipeline of large-scale infrastructure projects that will support growth, jobs and cheaper power for UK households.” – Keith Gains, Managing Director and UK Regional Leader for Quinbrook

The Cleve Hill Solar Park helps to shift the UK energy sector towards the potential of solar power

The UK, along with every other nation that signed on to the Paris Agreement, is working exceedingly hard to decarbonize the energy sector. The global consensus calls for more work to be done to reach the emission goals that were agreed upon at the Paris Agreement Summit a few years ago.

Several high-energy usage nations are building huge solar farms that further the progress of transitioning the global energy sector towards the renewable energy sector. The landmark project has the potential to reduce carbon emissions by more than 142,000 tonnes during the first year of operations. Additionally, the site will provide 2,500 direct and indirect jobs.

“Quinbrook is proud to further enhance our track record of successfully delivering milestone infrastructure projects that create such a meaningful and positive impact for the UK’s energy transition. Projects like Cleve Hill set new scale benchmarks that should increase confidence that the UK’s renewables targets can be achieved” – Rory Quinlan, Quinbrook’s Co-Founder and Managing Partner

Texas Border Business

McALLEN, Texas — The City of McAllen has announced one of the most ambitious development projects in its history: the transformation of the long-discussed Boeye Reservoir site into a vibrant, mixed-use destination designed to attract investment, tourism, and long-term economic growth.

During a press conference, Mayor Javier Villalobos described the announcement as “a historic and momentous occasion” for McAllen. “It’s such a pleasure and honor to be here for what is probably one of the biggest projects that the City of McAllen has ever had,” Villalobos said. “We’re talking about a project that is changing McAllen — the way we are, the way we think — and we’re bringing together the public, private, and community sectors like never before.”

The initiative, also referred to as the Boeye Project, represents a $230 million investment spanning 70 acres and will feature premium condominiums, luxury hotels, new water attractions, and an expansive recreational district, along with dining, retail, and entertainment spaces. The development aims to become a significant economic engine for South Texas while redefining McAllen as a regional hub for innovation and lifestyle.

Villalobos emphasized the project’s collaborative foundation, citing decades of effort by city leaders and previous administrations. “For decades, we’ve talked about the development of the Boeye Reservoir,” he said. “Past commissions and mayors saw the vision but couldn’t bring it to life—not because they didn’t want to, but because it was difficult. Today, we’re making it happen because we’ve done it right.”

He added that McAllen’s approach reflects a commitment to integrity and sustainability. “McAllen will not do something that is not right,” Villalobos stated. “We went back, revised, and refined the plan because McAllen will never do anything that is ever going to fail. This isn’t just a project—it’s a legacy.”

According to City Manager Isaac Tawil, the Boeye project will be “a transformative mixed-use development designed to elevate McAllen’s regional tourism appeal, enhance lifestyle amenities, and drive sustainable economic growth.” Tawil noted that the city’s vision aligns with national trends toward integrated, experience-driven destinations. “We’re not just adding a new development,” Tawil said. “We’re building a destination that will redefine what it means to live, learn, and invest in South Texas.”

The premium mixed-use design will combine modern residential spaces with vibrant public attractions, positioning McAllen as a prime destination for both residents and visitors. The new recreational district, anchored by innovative water attractions and lifestyle amenities, will complement the surrounding high-end condominiums, hotels, and entertainment venues, creating a thriving, multi-dimensional destination for business, leisure, and community gatherings.

The economic projections emphasize that vision. During construction, the project is expected to support over 2,200 jobs and generate $95 million in labor income, contributing approximately $136 million to GDP and $330 million in total economic output. Once complete, the site is projected to attract 460,000 visitors annually, generating $35.6 million in visitor spending and sustaining 900 permanent jobs with $26 million in wages each year.

Tawil also highlighted McAllen’s strong fiscal foundation, citing the city’s $580 million budget and $170 million dedicated to capital improvement projects. “With record-breaking sales taxes exceeding $96 million last year, McAllen offers one of the most stable and business-friendly environments in the state,” he said. “For investors, that means confidence and opportunity.”

The project’s master plan envisions a world-class environment where modern architecture and leisure coexist. The site’s strategic location—adjacent to expressways, the McAllen International Airport, and key retail corridors—positions it as a gateway for commerce, tourism, and regional connectivity.

Villalobos reiterated that the city’s partnership model ensures transparency and accountability. “Developers will be held accountable to ensure transparency and honesty,” he said. “There will be benchmarks—and that includes the city. This project will happen the right way, with collaboration and community at its heart.”

The city officially released a Request for Proposals (RFP) for developers on the morning of the announcement, inviting qualified partners to participate in shaping McAllen’s next landmark destination. Interested parties can access full details at mcallenmeansbusiness.com and through the City of McAllen’s procurement website.

City officials emphasized that the Boeye project is designed not only as a commercial success but as a long-term community asset. “This is more than a project—it’s a promise,” Tawil said. “It’s a declaration that McAllen’s best years are yet to come.”

Villalobos concluded with optimism about what the development means for the city’s future. “This is a new McAllen,” he said. “A McAllen that dreams big, delivers bigger, and stands united in purpose. We’re not just building structures—we’re building our legacy.”

Electric utilities that receive loans through the program must provide assurances to the government that financial benefits from the financing will be passed on to customers, the Energy Department said.
Wright, in a conference call with reporters, distinguished the AEP loan guarantee from a $4.9 billion federal loan guarantee the department cancelled in July.
The loan guarantee to AEP was among those conditionally approved under Biden, a fact Wright acknowledged to reporters.","WASHINGTON(AP) — The Department of Energy said Thursday it has finalized a $1.6 billion loan guarantee to a subsidiary of one of the nation's largest power companies to upgrade nearly 5,000 miles of transmission lines across five states, mostly in the Midwest, for largely fossil fuel-run energy.

AEP Transmission will upgrade power lines in Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Oklahoma and West Virginia to enhance enhance grid reliability and capacity, the Energy Department said. The project, first offered under the Biden administration, is meant to help meet surging electricity demand from data centers and artificial intelligence.

Ohio-based American Electric Power, which owns AEP Transmission, is one of the nation's largest utilities, serving 5.6 million customers in 11 states. It primarily produces electricity from coal, natural gas and nuclear power, along with renewable resources such as wind and hydroelectric power.

Thursday's announcement deepens the Trump administration’s commitment to traditional, polluting energy sources even as it works to discourage the U.S. from clean energy use.

Earlier this month, the administration cancelled $7.6 billion in grants that supported hundreds of clean energy projects in 16 states, all of which voted for Democrat Kamala Harris in last year’s presidential election. A total of 223 projects were terminated after a review determined they did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs or were not economically viable, the Energy Department said.

The cancellations include up to $1.2 billion for California’s hydrogen hub aimed at developing clean-burning hydrogen fuels to power ships and heavy-duty trucks. A hydrogen project costing up to $1 billion in the Pacific Northwest also was cancelled.

The loan guarantee finalized Thursday is the first offered by the Trump administration under the recently renamed Energy Dominance Financing program created by the massive tax-and-spending law approved this summer by congressional Republicans and signed by President Donald Trump. Electric utilities that receive loans through the program must provide assurances to the government that financial benefits from the financing will be passed on to customers, the Energy Department said.

The project and others being considered will help ensure that Americans ""will have access to affordable, reliable and secure energy for decades to come,” Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in a statement.

“The president has been clear: America must reverse course from the energy subtraction agenda of past administrations and strengthen our electrical grid,'' Wright said, adding that modernizing the grid and expanding transmission capacity ""will help position the United States to win the AI race and grow our manufacturing base.”

The upgrades supported by the federal financing will replace existing transmission lines in existing rights-of-way with new lines capable of carrying more energy, the power company said.

More than 2,000 miles of transmission lines in Ohio serving 1.5 million people will be replaced, along with more than 1,400 miles in Indiana and Michigan serving 600,000 customers, the company said. An additional 1,400 miles in Oklahoma, serving about 1.2 million people and 26 miles in West Virginia, serving 460,000 people, will be replaced.

The projects will create about 1,100 construction jobs, the company said.

The loan guarantee will save customers money and improve reliability while supporting economic growth in the five states, said Bill Fehrman, AEP's chairman, president and chief executive officer. “The funds we will save through this program enable us to make additional investments to enhance service for our customers,"" he added.

Wright, in a conference call with reporters, distinguished the AEP loan guarantee from a $4.9 billion federal loan guarantee the department cancelled in July. That money would have boosted the planned Grain Belt Express, a new high-voltage transmission line set to deliver solar and wind-generated electricity from the Midwest to eastern states.

The Energy Department said at the time it was “not critical for the federal government to have a role” in the first phase of the $11 billion project planned by Chicago-based Invenergy. The department also questioned whether the project could meet strict financial conditions required, a claim Wright repeated Thursday.

“Ultimately that is a commercial enterprise that needs private developers,” Wright said. The company has indicated the Grain Belt project will go forward.

Trump and Wright have repeatedly derided wind and solar energy as unreliable and opposed efforts to combat climate change by moving away from fossil fuels. Wright said the Grain Belt Express loan was among billions of dollars worth of commitments “rushed out the door” in the waning days of former President Joe Biden’s administration.

It’s clear that policy change is needed to address the compounding loss in gas tax revenue as a result of widespread EV adoption.","Electric vehicles are more popular than ever, with 21% of new car sales in the United States being either electric, hybrid, or plug-in hybrid models. One of the unintended consequences of this consumer trend is the effect on gas tax revenue.

Every gasoline and diesel sale in the U.S. includes a small added tax. This tax is used to fund state transportation budgets, highway maintenance, and infrastructure projects. As a result of more EVs on the road, the amount of revenue generated by the gas tax is decreasing. This has created interesting financial repercussions, and a variety of solutions are being adopted to help.

Using state-by-state fuel tax data from the Department of Energy and consumer EV trends from the Alternative Fuels Data Center, CheapInsurance.com analyzed the economic impact of the changing transportation landscape and what’s being done to remedy the situation.

Nationwide EV adoption trends

Millions of Americans are choosing to purchase electric vehicles over traditional gas ones. The reasons include reduced charging costs compared to gas, lower emissions, and tax incentives.

The Bureau of Transportation Statistics reported that, in 2024, there were 1.2 million electric vehicle sales and 1.6 million hybrid electric vehicle sales. This is up from 238,000 EV sales and 455,000 hybrid-electric sales in 2020. This upward trend is likely to continue.

New EV registrations by state

The rate at which EVs are being bought and put on the road differs by state. This is mainly influenced by government policies, cultural attitudes, and economic factors.

For example, California has recently tried to enact an EV mandate that requires a certain percentage of new vehicle sales to be fully electric. This plan was then adopted by 11 other states. Although later blocked by the Senate, this prompted many consumers to transition to EVs.

Culturally, many Americans across the country do not want EVs, which explains lower purchase numbers in some states. The Pew Research Center found that, in May 2025, only 18% of Republicans and Republican-leaning individuals were at least somewhat interested in purchasing one. This is compared to Democrats, with 48% somewhat or very interested. This data was collected via a survey of Americans conducted from April 28 to May 4, 2025. This suggests that “red states” will have lower numbers of EV registrations than “blue states.”

A look at gas tax revenue loss in key EV states

The states with the highest EV registration numbers per 100,000 residents have the most significant loss in gas tax revenue. The number of EV vehicles on the road compared to gasoline vehicles is still quite low, so impacts are not being strongly felt yet. However, many states are predicting substantial losses in their gas tax revenue over the next decade.

In California, for example, the Mineta Transportation Institute predicts that there will be a 64% loss in revenue from 2025 to 2040. In this study, researchers considered eight different scenarios, each with a different rate of how many EVs are purchased, how many people in the state drive, and how many personal vehicles get registered. Results used 2024 inflation-adjusted numbers.

Budget impacts on state transportation departments

Millions of dollars in losses will have a severe impact on state highway and transportation departments if left unaddressed. According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, 2024 data pulled from the National Association of State Budget Officers states that gas tax revenue accounts for 35.9% of state transportation department revenue nationwide.

Without this revenue, several impacts will be felt:

Deficits in highway and road maintenance

Slower completion of infrastructure projects

Less development and expansion

Higher vehicle maintenance costs for the general population

How states are responding and planning for the future

States are recognizing that action needs to be taken to secure transportation budgets. Pew Research Center reports that many states are suffering from budget gaps and are having difficulty completing projects like bridge repairs.

To tackle the issue of reduced gas tax revenue, many states have begun taking measures and implementing programs that will generate revenue from electric vehicles instead.

EV registration fees

The most significant way that governmental bodies have buoyed transportation department revenue is with EV registration fees. These fees are charged at the initial time of registration and on an annual basis.

In Texas, for example, EV owners must pay $400 for the first-time registration and $200 each year, according to the Department of Energy.

Road usage charges

Other states are opting for a road usage fee. In Hawai‘i, EV owners are given the option to pay an annual, per-mile usage fee instead of a large registration fee. This is currently set at $0.08/mile, up to $50/year.

Oregon offers a similar program, called OReGO. California is also experimenting with its own pilot program.

What changes are needed on the road ahead?

It’s clear that policy change is needed to address the compounding loss in gas tax revenue as a result of widespread EV adoption. The amount of revenue that will need to be replaced is unclear, however, especially with an anticipated decline in EV demand due to the federal tax incentives ending.

Regardless, state agencies and the federal government will need to prioritize alternative methods for generating revenue. This could be through registration fees, road usage programs, or other revenue-generating systems that are put into place. It’s likely that the EV marketplace will continue to grow and that more households will begin replacing their gas vehicles, so prompt change is needed in the coming years.",https://krdo.b-cdn.net/2025/10/cheapinsurance-gas-taxes.jpg,N,,2025-10-16 16:10:38.316759

AEP Transmission will upgrade power lines in Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Oklahoma and West Virginia, primarily to enhance enhance grid reliability and capacity, the Energy Department said. The project by AEP Transmission, a subsidiary of Ohio-based American Electric Power, is meant to help meet surging electricity demand from data centers and artificial intelligence.

AEP primarily produces electricity from coal, natural gas and nuclear power, along with renewable resources such as wind and hydroelectric power.

Thursday’s announcement deepens the Trump administration’s commitment to traditional, polluting energy sources even as it works to discourage the U.S. from clean energy use.

The move comes as the Trump administration has moved to cancel $7.6 billion in grants that supported hundreds of clean energy projects in 16 states, all of which voted for Democrat Kamala Harris in last year’s presidential election. A total of 223 projects were terminated after a review determined they did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs or were not economically viable, the Energy Department said.

The cancellations include up to $1.2 billion for California’s hydrogen hub aimed at producing clean-burning hydrogen fuels to power ships and heavy-duty trucks. A hydrogen project costing up to $1 billion in the Pacific Northwest also was cancelled.

The loan guarantee finalized Thursday is the first offered by the Trump administration under the recently renamed Energy Dominance Financing program created by the massive tax-and-spending law approved this summer by congressional Republicans and signed by President Donald Trump. Electric utilities that receive loans through the program must provide assurances to the government that financial benefits from the financing will be passed on to customers, the Energy Department said.

The project and others being considered will help ensure that Americans “will have access to affordable, reliable and secure energy for decades to come,” Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in a statement.

“The president has been clear: America must reverse course from the energy subtraction agenda of past administrations and strengthen our electrical grid,” Wright said, adding that modernizing the grid and expanding transmission capacity “will help position the United States to win the AI race and grow our manufacturing base.”

The upgrades supported by the federal financing will replace existing transmission lines in existing rights-of-way with new lines capable of carrying more energy, the power company said.

More than 2,000 miles of transmission lines in Ohio serving 1.5 million people will be replaced, along with more than 1,400 miles in Indiana and Michigan serving 600,000 customers, the company said. An additional 1,400 miles in Oklahoma, serving about 1.2 million people and 26 miles in West Virginia, serving 460,000 people, will be replaced.

The projects will create about 1,100 construction jobs, the company said.

The loan guarantee will save customers money and improve reliability while supporting economic growth in the five states, said Bill Fehrman, AEP’s chairman, president and chief executive officer. “The funds we will save through this program enable us to make additional investments to enhance service for our customers,” he added.

Wright, in a conference call with reporters, distinguished the AEP loan guarantee from a $4.9 billion federal loan guarantee the department cancelled in July. That money would have boosted the planned Grain Belt Express, a new high-voltage transmission line set to deliver solar and wind-generated electricity from the Midwest to eastern states.

The Energy Department said at the time it was “not critical for the federal government to have a role” in the first phase of the $11 billion project planned by Chicago-based Invenergy. The department also questioned whether the project could meet strict financial conditions required, a claim Wright repeated Thursday.

“Ultimately that is a commercial enterprise that needs private developers,” Wright said. The company has indicated the Grain Belt project will go forward.

Trump and Wright have repeatedly derided wind and solar energy as unreliable and opposed efforts to combat climate change by moving away from fossil fuels. Wright said the Grain Belt Express loan was among billions of dollars worth of commitments “rushed out the doors” by former President Joe Biden’s administration after the 2024 election.",https://www.qcnews.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/109/2025/10/68f133ed4a34b7.64013515.jpeg?w=1280,N,,2025-10-16 15:09:13.717778

American Electric Power’s transmission subsidiary, AEP Transmission, closed on a $1.6 billion loan guarantee from the U.S. Department of Energy’s Loan Programs Office (LPO).

The funding will support upgrades to nearly 5,000 miles of transmission lines in Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Oklahoma, and West Virginia.

American Electric Power said the project will save customers approximately $275 million over the life of the loan through lower financing costs reflected in utility bills.

The project involves replacing aging lines within existing rights-of-way with higher-capacity infrastructure, boosting grid reliability and efficiency.

American Electric Power estimates the initiative will generate about 1,100 construction jobs while strengthening the company’s ability to meet growing energy demand, particularly from sectors such as artificial intelligence, data centers, and manufacturing.

The company projects that new and expanding customers will drive an additional 24 gigawatts of electricity demand by 2030.

Bill Fehrman, American Electric Power’s Chairman, President, and CEO, said that the DOE-backed financing will help lower customer costs, improve reliability, and enable further investment in modernization initiatives.

American Electric Power outlined the scope of its grid modernization by state, noting that Ohio Transco will handle 76 projects covering about 2,122 miles of transmission lines serving 1.5 million customers.

Indiana & Michigan (I&M) Transco will oversee 29 projects spanning 1,410 miles for roughly 600,000 customers. In Oklahoma, 17 projects will replace 1,434 miles of lines reaching 1.2 million customers. West Virginia will see four projects covering 26 miles, benefiting approximately 460,000 customers.

Approximately 100 miles of the first upgraded lines will be in Ohio and Oklahoma, with additional projects to follow.

The modernized grid will help American Electric Power handle record-breaking load growth while supporting the nation’s transition toward cleaner energy sources and digital infrastructure expansion.

North Carolina applied for the program in 2024 and was awarded $156 million to create at least 43 megawatts of solar energy over five years.
When Hurricane Helene hit North Carolina, nearly 1.2 million Duke Energy customers lost electricity, some for weeks.

The funds would have supported more than 12,000 households in North Carolina, helping families save an average of 20% on their utility bills while creating local energy jobs, according to a release by the attorney general's office.

“These funds were going to help low-income and rural North Carolinians save money on their energy bills,” Jackson said. “Thousands of families were going to have the option to install solar power, save money, and have another energy option after a major storm. Now the EPA has illegally cancelled those funds, so I’m going to court to bring $150 million back to our state.”

Department of Environmental Quality Secretary Reid Wilson said the program’s cancellation would prevent rooftop solar installation for thousands of families, reduce energy resilience, and limit job creation.

“Rooftop solar drives down utility bills, reduces air pollution and creates jobs,"" Wilson said. ""The program’s cancellation would hurt the electric grid’s ability to be resilient to future disasters and would hamper North Carolina’s efforts to ensure reliable, clean, and affordable energy supplies.""

The Solar for All program, created under the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022, was designed to provide grants for low-income households, multifamily housing, medically vulnerable residents, and community solar pilot programs. North Carolina applied for the program in 2024 and was awarded $156 million to create at least 43 megawatts of solar energy over five years. Without the funding, these households cannot afford to install rooftop solar or benefit from the energy savings.

The program would have also helped families maintain power during outages caused by natural disasters, the release said. When Hurricane Helene hit North Carolina, nearly 1.2 million Duke Energy customers lost electricity, some for weeks. Households with solar panels can store energy and continue to generate electricity even during grid blackouts.

Solar for All was also expected to create local jobs for contractors, construction workers, and maintenance staff, adding roughly 140 new positions in rural areas. Solar energy currently employs more than 9,000 North Carolinians across more than 200 businesses.

In a letter to Jackson, solar business leaders said the EPA’s cancellation would “deny small businesses the benefits of those investments that they have planned for in anticipation of the program.”

North Carolina went through a rigorous application process, including submitting tracking data and regular reports to ensure the program helped low-income households. The EPA awarded the state $156 million in July 2024 but abruptly cancelled the grants in August.

In their lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington, the states argue the EPA violated the Administrative Procedure Act and the U.S. Constitution’s Separation of Powers Doctrine.

“We see a missing piece in this orderbook strategy—the absence of nuclear waste disposal,” said Rod Baltzer, CEO of Deep Isolation.
“By embedding disposal into their orderbook strategy, first mover states can reduce financial risk, increase investor confidence, and build public trust that advanced nuclear comes with a complete lifecycle solution.” Baltzer added that Deep Isolation’s deep borehole drilling technology, adapted from the oil and gas industry, along with the company’s disposal canister system, can play a key role in helping states meet its nuclear waste challenges.
“The orderbook approach moves away from one-off demonstrations to propel widespread market adoption by building a robust demand signal for the most viable advanced nuclear technologies,” NASEO said.

Baltzer added that Deep Isolation’s deep borehole drilling technology, adapted from the oil and gas industry, along with the company’s disposal canister system, can play a key role in helping states meet its nuclear waste challenges.

Background: Facilitated by NASEO, Idaho National Laboratory, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, and the Department of Energy’s Gateway for Accelerated Innovation in Nuclear, the Advanced Nuclear First Mover Initiative is being led by state cochairs New York, Indiana, Kentucky, Tennessee, and Wyoming, with participating states Louisiana, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Utah, Virginia, and West Virginia.

According to NASEO, the governors of these states are committed to working with the private sector, the DOE, and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to accelerate advanced nuclear projects and bring more power to the electric grid for reliability, sustainability, and economic growth.

On September 16, NASEO issued a request for information on the initiative to provide the organization and first mover states with information on a potential structure for an advanced nuclear project orderbook strategy, status and use cases for different nuclear technologies, and investment and coordination models.

“The orderbook approach moves away from one-off demonstrations to propel widespread market adoption by building a robust demand signal for the most viable advanced nuclear technologies,” NASEO said.

The deadline for the RFI was recently extended from October 10 to October 17.

Recommendations: Noting that the lack of a safe, permanent waste solution remains one of Americans’ top concerns about nuclear power, Deep Isolation said its recommendations draw on consensus across the advanced reactor industry, as reflected in the U.S. Nuclear Industry Council’s “Action Plan for Transforming the Back End of the U.S. Nuclear Fuel Cycle.”

“Deep Isolation calls on NASEO to integrate USNIC’s recommendations into its orderbook strategy: working collaboratively with communities to accelerating innovative disposal technologies, launching near-term demonstrations, and mobilizing private investment through public-private partnerships and legislative reform,” the company said.

Deep Isolation’s submission highlights three specific calls to action for participating states:

Join the Deep Borehole Demonstration Center, a Cameron, Texas, nonprofit where the company plans to conduct a full-scale nonradioactive deep borehole disposal pilot with initial canister emplacement targeted for 2027.

Support early borehole demonstrations in their states, including via joint initiatives with the DOE at federal laboratories such as INL or ORNL (consistent with President Trump’s Executive Order 14302 to leverage these sites for innovative nuclear demonstrations).

Commodifying a carcinogen: Critical raw materials from arsenic-laden groundwater.","Arsenic is a double-edged sword. It is a known carcinogen found naturally at high levels in groundwater. But it is also an element that is critical for clean energy technologies such as solar cells.

Connecting those two flows, researchers have found a way to convert the arsenic in groundwater into pure arsenic nanoparticles that can be used in manufacturing. “The creation of valuable [critical raw materials] from carcinogenic treatment by-products is a potentially disruptive technology for the water sector that can alter global [arsenic] supply chains,” Kaifeng Wang and Case M. van Genuchten, geochemists at the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland, write in a paper published in the journal Science Advances.

Arsenic, which occurs naturally in rocks, soils, and water, is highly toxic. Long-term exposure to the element, typically because of contaminated groundwater, can cause a range of adverse health effects, including neurological impairment in children, cancer, cardiovascular disease and diabetes.

But the element is also useful in various clean energy technologies. It goes in the metal alloys used in batteries, for instance. And gallium arsenide semiconductors are vital for making high-efficiency solar cells and the high-performance computer chips that go in electronics and telecommunications devices.

Most of the world’s arsenic is mined and produced in China today. Because of the element’s use in technologies and its constrained supply chain, the US and the EU both list it as a critical raw material.

Arsenic usually exists in groundwater in the form of arsenate or arsenite ions. Around the world, treatment with iron oxide particles is an established way to remove these arsenic compounds from groundwater. The process creates a concentrated solid sludge that is difficult to dispose.

The Danish researchers came up with a two-stage chemical process to recover and reuse the arsenic in groundwater. First, they extract arsenic from the solid sludge using an alkali solution . The next step involves treating the extracted arsenic with a common sulfur-bearing chemical called thiourea dioxide. This process gives pure metallic arsenic nanoparticles.

“This work sets the foundation for rethinking the role of As treatment as a dual service that provides safe drinking water and generates local sources of critical raw materials,” the research duo writes.

Indiana lawmakers are weighing new rules to address what local officials call “cable pollution,” or the growing problem of unused or sagging wires left behind by telecom companies along streets and public rights-of-way.

At a Statehouse hearing last Wednesday, Franklin, Ind., Mayor Steve Barnett (R) — whose city sits about 20 minutes south of Indianapolis — blamed telecom companies for leaving behind miles of low-hanging and buried cables. He said his city has spent about $60,000 locating and removing unused lines.

“We shouldn’t have to spend taxpayer dollars fixing the telecoms’ problems,” he said. “It’s time for some oversight.”

Rep. Michelle Davis, R-Whiteland, and Rep. Robb Greene, R-Shelbyville, authored House Bill 1480 earlier this year to set standards for installing and maintaining telecom lines. Lawmakers said they are now considering similar legislation for the 2026 session after the bill received a hearing but no vote in 2025.

Lobbyists for AT&T and Comcast argued that new state mandates would duplicate existing oversight and slow broadband deployment.

AT&T lobbyist Steve Rogers said adding layers of regulation could “slow down investment and deployment” and warned that giving cities broad enforcement powers would create “huge bureaucracies.”

Rogers told lawmakers that telecoms already follow strict safety and construction rules.

“We are subject to the National Electric Safety Code,” he said. “We’re subject to 811, ‘Call Before You Dig’ regulations, and FCC pole-attachment rules. The idea that there are no rules and we need to give cities and towns the ability to fine people — that is just not the case.”

Oversight currently rests with the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission and the Federal Communications Commission, but lawmakers remain divided on whether that was enough.

Sen. Rick Niemeyer, R-Lowell, backed local control, while Sen. Greg Taylor, D-Indianapolis, called for statewide rules and line identifiers to assign responsibility.

For some of us, that’s a truck hauling gear or navigating rough roads in remote areas. For others, it’s a sedan for a daily commute or running errands. For those that can’t afford a car, it may be a bike or a bus.

Thousands of people and local businesses across the state—in both rural and urban areas—are already driving electric cars and trucks and finding them to be a great option for doing what they need them to do.

The Natural Resources Council of Maine (NRCM) attended several National Drive Electric Week events in October to hear directly from Mainers about their experience driving electric cars and trucks. Here’s some of what we heard.

These drivers were excited to share their stories in the hope that it would help their neighbors form an accurate perception of electric vehicles. And sharing their stories might help those who are considering an electric car or truck for their next vehicle make a more informed decision.

Ted, Waterford, Ford F-150 Lightning

Ted’s electric truck comes in handy around the farm, for driving across rough terrain but also to power the pressurized fans used in his two greenhouses. He bought it two years ago using the federal tax credit made possible by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. Although bison are no longer on the farm, the license plate is a nice homage to the expansive livestock he has kept there.

Brenda, Norway, Chevy Bolt

A co-owner of the Norway Brewing Company, Brenda is a community staple in Norway and a steadfast advocate for downtown revitalization. She uses public charging often, especially on her trips to Connecticut and Long Island to visit family. She now has all of her favorite charging stops mapped out in her head (with the occasional help of her PlugShare app, of course). Her interest in EVs was first sparked at a Ride and Drive event. When she first purchased her car in 2023, she received a $500 charging gift card, which she still hasn’t used up!

Craig, Wells, Chevy Bolt EUV

Craig got his most recent EV at a used car dealership and qualified for the $4,000 used EV tax credit under the Inflation Reduction Act. Paired with his 24 rooftop solar panels at home and his 6 home batteries (both of which qualified for tax credits), he’s making the most of an electrified set up. If the power goes out, he can charge off his battery bank until the power is restored, while also using the batteries as a backup home generator. Since he purchased it in 2023, the Bolt has required zero maintenance.

City of Bangor, Ford F-150 Lightning, Hyundai Ioniq 6, Polaris Ranger EV

The City of Bangor is rapidly electrifying its municipal fleet, boasting a number of models for different use purposes. The Public Works Department was showing off its recent Polaris Ranger EV, an offroad 4-wheeler that can be easily charged from a 120V wall outlet. This smaller vehicle allows for quiet offroad access, rain or shine, as the Public Works team keeps city infrastructure working for Bangor residents.

Zack, Raymond, Honda Prologue

Zack caught the EV bug after test-driving a Chevy Bolt at a previous EV ride and drive event and hasn’t looked back since. He’s leasing his new Honda Prologue in order to qualify for the federal tax credit and commutes half an hour to work both ways without a problem. In fact, he said one of his favorite features is the remote start, which allows him to heat up his car during the winter months in the garage or parking lot before he gets behind the wheel. After doing the math for his home set up, he estimates that the Prologue costs $8-9 to fully charge, a fraction of the cost of a tank of gas.

Fred, Norway, Nomad Taiga Snowmobile

Fred is a legend in the Maine EV community, becoming the first EV owner in Maine when he bought a Nissan Leaf in 2012. He’s been all EV ever since. He is most excited about the two most recent electrified additions to his fleet: an electric scooter and an electric snowmobile. The snowmobile logged 300 miles this winter as the primary grooming machine for the Roberts Farm Preserve cross-country ski trails. “Trust me, this thing’s got a lot more pep than the gas ones,” he said with a boyish grin. He’s been showing it off to some local downhill ski mountains in the hope that they’ll make the switch for a zippier, quieter, more cost-effective experience maintaining the slopes.

Sun Dog Solar, Belfast, Workhorse W4CC

Sun Dog Solar, one of the foremost solar installers in Midcoast and Central Maine, recently got two fully electric Class 4 work trucks through an Efficiency Maine program to encourage commercial adoption of medium- and heavy-duty EVs. Their 150-mile range will check all the boxes for local work within the Belfast service region, and the trucks will return home to charge each evening after a day of work. The Sun Dog team recently installed two fast chargers at their new office space, which is going to make their charging quick and easy while also offering charging access to the general public. Their fast chargers are backed up by a battery bank, so solar power can charge the batteries throughout the day, which then provide juice for the fast chargers. This helps them take full advantage of solar power while avoiding demand charges from the on-site fast chargers.

For a closer look at how rural Mainers are using their EVs, check out our visit to John and Erma Evans in Dexter.

Seal, Otisfield, Nissan Ariya

Seal’s 5th EV has been a major hit for her and her family, with over 300 miles of range and all-wheel drive for great handling in winter conditions. She got over range anxiety after her first EV, and now she and her family rely on two fully electric vehicles for all their travel needs.

Annette, South Portland, Hyundai Ioniq 5

Annette was cooking hot dogs with an electric grill plugged into her EV as she kindly sat to chat with interested folks passing by. She was first inspired to look into EVs when her local rec center installed EV chargers a few years ago. When she learned about the federal tax credit for EVs, her Ioniq 5 purchase was a no brainer, made all the easier by the recent installation of EV chargers at her apartment building in South Portland. Now, at age 90, Annette can easily charge at home and zip around where she needs to, trading off at the free charger with fellow EV drivers that live in her building.

Matt and Wesley, Bowdoinham, Mercedes EQS

Matt has been driving an EV for 12 years and is leasing his most recent edition in order to qualify for the federal tax credit. Matt’s 15-year-old son Wesley is logging all his driving hours on his learning permit in the Mercedes and loving every minute. With more than 500 miles of range, their EV takes the two of them to archery tournaments in Connecticut and back without a single charging stop. Their rooftop solar array at home allows them to charge both of their family EVs nearly for free.

Versant Power, Penobscot, Aroostook, Washington Counties, Chevy Silverado

Versant Power now has a dozen fully electric Chevy Silverado work trucks to access their large service area in eastern and northern Maine. Each truck boasts 440-480 miles of all-electric range, providing plenty of power to get to Versant ratepayers and power lines in rural areas during storms, power outages, and long workdays.

More about EVs

Pollution from gas-powered cars and trucks makes our air less safe to breathe and fuels climate change, so it’s important that Maine transition to cleaner, healthier ways to get around. NRCM is working with partners across the state to advance healthier, more affordable transportation choices, from electric cars and trucks to more reliable transit and safer walking and biking paths.

Sales of electric cars are booming. July through September 2025 saw several U.S. EV sales records smashed, with full-battery EVs reaching 10% of new vehicle sales for the first time ever. This recent success is in part due to a rush prior to the expiration of federal tax credits for EV purchases on September 30th.

Unfortunately, the efforts by the Trump Administration and their allies in Congress to kill tax credits for clean energy solutions will make it harder for Mainers to choose what is right for them. Worse, the EPA under the Trump administration is planning on repealing tailpipe pollution standards, which, according to their own proposal, will increase gas prices. For those Mainers looking to go electric, Efficiency Maine will still continue providing some incentives. Visit their website to learn more.

Here at NRCM we won’t stop fighting for a brighter future for everyone in our rural state, so they have healthier, more reliable and affordable ways to get around.

Environmental review will draw on archived FRA Tier 1 materials for the Chicago–Detroit–Pontiac corridor to update alignments and ridership forecasts.","A three-party memorandum of understanding signed Oct. 15 commits $40 million to engineering and environmental work for a new multimodal transit hub that could re-establish passenger rail service at Detroit’s Michigan Central campus by the end of the decade.

The agreement, announced jointly by the Michigan Dept. of Transportation, the City of Detroit and Michigan Central, combines $10 million in federal RAISE funding — short for Rebuilding American Infrastructure with Sustainability and Equity — with $30 million in state contributions to launch preliminary design and environmental review.

According to documents examined by ENR, the federal award was issued earlier this year and remains active—with no indication of rescission—though RAISE grants are subject to obligation deadlines that determine when funds are formally committed.

Officials said the planning phase will define the project’s scope, delivery approach and schedule before any construction moves forward.

Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D) said the plan “lays the foundation for a new multimodal transportation hub that will grow our regional economy,” calling it a critical investment in both “mobility and opportunity.”

A Symbolic Return

Completed in 1913 and once one of the nation’s most prominent rail terminals, Michigan Central Station closed to passengers in 1988 and sat vacant for decades before Ford Motor Co. acquired the property in 2018.

Following a $740 million restoration, Ford reopened the Beaux-Arts landmark in 2024 as the centerpiece of its Corktown mobility innovation campus.

The new MOU extends that revitalization beyond architecture. If realized, it would return Amtrak and intercity bus operations to the site for the first time in nearly 40 years. A new facility at Michigan Central would likely replace Detroit’s aging Amtrak station in the city’s New Center neighborhood.

City infrastructure chief Sam Krassenstein said residents “deserve a first-class facility for bus and train service, and this agreement puts us on a path to make it happen.”

Project partners said the funding covers engineering and environmental review and will help define ownership structure and delivery model. MDOT plans to coordinate with Amtrak and the Federal Railroad Administration to assess the feasibility of restoring intercity service.

Beth Kmetz-Armitage, Michigan Central’s director of commercial development, said the initiative is about “strengthening regional connections — both immediately regional in Ann Arbor and broadly Midwestern all the way to Chicago.”

While no final alignment has been set, MDOT officials said the plan could eventually extend Amtrak’s Wolverine line from Chicago through Windsor, Ontario, to connect with VIA Rail service to Toronto. Amtrak has indicated such a cross-border link could be achieved with minimal new capital investment, pending regulatory and customs agreements.

Kmetz-Armitage said in a press conference that an existing rail line already connects Toronto to Chicago under the Detroit River, but is currently used only for freight traffic.

Plans call for a new multimodal transit hub west of the station, on Ford-owned land, where passengers could board beginning in 2028. According to Michigan Central, early projections estimate about 66,000 annual riders once the hub is operational.

The restored station itself would not serve as a boarding point; instead, travelers to and from Canada would pass through customs and border control in Windsor, Ontario. She said the planned facility would also improve westbound connections along Amtrak’s Wolverine corridor toward Chicago.

The MOU sets 2026 for completion of environmental studies and 2028 for final design and procurement, with operations targeted before 2030.

Technical and Financial Context

MDOT’s 2023 Corridor Identification and Development submission to the Federal Railroad Administration describes the Detroit–Pontiac–Chicago corridor as a 304-mile route spanning Amtrak, Norfolk Southern, Canadian National and Conrail ownership.

The corridor has received multiple federal grants since 2010 for signaling, track upgrades and speed improvements; the Wolverine’s on-time performance averaged just 62% in fiscal 2022, according to MDOT’s application citing Amtrak’s status report.

The department manages about $100 million annually from the state’s Comprehensive Transportation Fund for passenger and freight programs. The Detroit hub would likely replace and consolidate the Howard Street intercity bus terminal downtown and the aging Amtrak station in the city’s New Center neighborhood.

Krassenstein said the plan builds on the station’s historical role as Detroit’s “gateway,” adding that re-establishing rail service “in the shadow of the station” revives a core part of the city’s infrastructure identity.

Ford to Purchase Old Detroit Train Station

No contractor or joint venture has been named for the effort, and no procurement has been issued. MDOT and city officials said design and contracting decisions will follow completion of the environmental and preliminary engineering phases.

Bradley C. Wieferich, Michigan’s state transportation director, said the partnership “is a positive step to further develop Michigan Central into a true transportation hub and innovation ecosystem,” but added that additional federal coordination will be required before procurement.

While Detroit-based Christman–Brinker managed Ford’s restoration of Michigan Central Station, that joint venture has not been linked to the new rail hub. Public procurement records reviewed Oct. 16 show no active RFQ or RFP through the state’s SIGMA VSS or the city’s BidNet Direct portals.

Hurdles Remain

The project faces complex integration issues requiring coordination with freight operators for access tracks and platform space, as well as a review of regulatory and customs requirements under the 2019 U.S.–Canada Land, Rail, Marine and Air Transport Preclearance Agreement.

Environmental review will draw on archived FRA Tier 1 materials for the Chicago–Detroit–Pontiac corridor to update alignments and ridership forecasts.

Regional research by the Southeast Michigan Council of Governments on the Ann Arbor–Detroit commuter rail corridor will inform how the hub interfaces with local transit and Detroit Metropolitan Airport.

Michigan Central CEO Josh Sirefman said the project “brings together our legacy infrastructure and our future mobility,” adding that the hub aims to link “innovation, community access and cross-border connectivity.”

Whether those ambitions materialize, he said, will depend on aligning funding sources and “translating years of vision into engineered access and buildable design.”",https://www.enr.com/ext/resources/2025/10/16/Michigan-Centrail-Rail-Station.jpg?height=635&t=1760624685&width=1200,N,,2025-10-16 15:08:49.018412

The Biden administration’s former top energy adviser Amos Hochstein warned on Thursday that AI’s energy demand is at risk of outstripping supply.

“We have a huge gap on energy and AI,” Hochstein, who is a managing partner at TWG Global, said at Semafor’s World Economy Summit in Washington, DC.

“If things don’t happen soon, it will become a crisis. I’m not an alarmist in general, but I don’t think we are going in the right direction,” Hochstein said. TWG Global is heavily investing in the AI industry. Earlier this year, it announced a partnership with Palantir and xAI to develop AI for financial services and insurance sectors.

Tech companies are jockeying for energy to power data centers to run their AI models. As these companies look to expand their data center footprint, their capacity requirements have raised questions over whether existing power generation will be enough. And in communities where new data centers are being built, some residents have claimed the capacity is raising their energy bills, with some fighting against new projects.

Opposition to new data centers has also become an issue in some local elections. Candidates from both parties in a Virginia county board of supervisors election are campaigning to ban new data center construction, Semafor reported this week.

An IEA report from April projected that electricity demand from data centers worldwide is set to more than double by 2030 to slightly above the electricity consumption of all of Japan today, with AI driving a majority of the increase. In the US, the IEA estimated that data center power consumption will account for almost half of the growth in electricity demand between now and 2030.

Know More

Hochstein emphasized that AI’s energy requirements could threaten growth.

American AI companies are working incredibly fast and are armed with unprecedented amounts of capital. At the same time, they are competing both with each other and China to build the best technologies, he said. Meanwhile, utility and power companies, and the officials overseeing such projects, operate much more slowly.

“The culture clash is significant,” Hochstein said.

AI companies “used to talk about [doing] a gigawatt cluster. Now, we’re talking about five gigawatt clusters,” Hochstein said, adding that is only set to increase.

“We don’t have that power. We don’t have that supply chain of materials and turbines and masters and electricians.”

“AI companies are finally coming to the fact that, ‘OK, I’m really smart at technology and AI. I may not know energy,’” Hochstein said.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/pcqAWjv.4TTCsXa3Y64spA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/semafor_310/dbfb82198b8e6edde9dd2f635bd4dc84,N,,2025-10-16 15:09:28.613953

By Victoria Heath

Every action has an equal and opposite reaction. Newton’s phrase could not be more fitting to describe America’s oscillating stance on climate policy. As Trump withdraws the US from major clean energy commitments – such as the Paris Agreement – look in another direction and you’ll find projects in the nation toiling away to construct offshore wind farms, like those in New York, or solar-storage projects in California.

As the game of tug of war continues, public bodies and experts alike have shared their concerns over such a turbulent environment. The US Chamber of Commerce has expressed in no uncertain terms its dissatisfaction with ‘the [Trump] administration’s contradictory approach to energy policy’, while a paper published in The Lancet describes the US’s climate policy as ‘erratic’. It’s clear to see: the road ahead to the future of the US’s energy is one paved with uncertainty.

While Trump continues to rescind funding from climate projects, it may seem inevitable that the US is heading towards a future comprised of fossil fuels and incessant cries of the infamous ‘drill, baby, drill’ mantra. Yet, in reality, the situation is far more complex, with the US continuing to toe the line between clean energy leadership and carbon-heavy dependency.

Clean(er) energy

Despite mounting rollbacks on climate policies under the Trump administration, the clean energy sector is still booming in the US. Accounting for around 15 per cent of global clean energy investment, the US announced or advanced 523 new clean energy projects between August 2022 and February 2024. And in 2023 alone, the industry added 142,000 jobs – a 4.2 per cent increase that was more than double the growth rate of the overall US economy.

Such a trend continued into 2024, where clean energy employment growth was around three times faster than overall US job growth. Since 2020, clean energy and clean vehicle sectors have collectively added more than half a million jobs to the US economy, expanding the total workforce to around 3.56 million people.

The shares of renewables are also notable – in 2024, renewables accounted for more than 90 per cent of all new US electrical generating capacity. Solar alone contributed to 81 per cent of that new capacity. Planned additional construction projects in 2025 are still strongly skewed toward renewables – especially solar and battery, which are projected to make up 81 per cent of new capacity.

For the first time ever, in certain months in 2024, electricity from solar and wind outpaced that from coal. In 2024, solar and wind together produced more electricity than coal.

Carbon-free energy sources that are able to operate 24/7, such as geothermal and nuclear, are also garnering attention in the nation. For example, in 2024, Microsoft signed a 20-year power purchase agreement with Constellation for nuclear energy; Amazon said it would invest $500 million in small modular nuclear reactors, and Google announced plans to purchase power from small modular reactors. Clearly, big players on the global stage are staking a vested interest in renewable energy sources, offering hope for a decarbonised future.

In terms of clean energy manufacturing, certain US states are coming out on top. In 2024, 12 states generated more than 30 per cent of their electricity from wind, solar and geothermal energy. Iowa, South Dakota and Kansas each produced more than 50 per cent of their electricity from wind alone.

Texas has also made significant inroads into renewable energy. In recent years, the state has installed large quantities of solar, wind and battery capacity – far more than any other state. Since 2014, it has seen its solar output grow more than 70-fold, and battery capacity increase by nearly 95-fold.

One reason to explain such an uptick is Texas’s location, with its excellent wind corridors and high solar insolation. With a relatively low population density in rural areas, Texas has more opportunities to begin large-scale generation projects compared to more urban-centric regions.

However, such large-scale projects, like those in Texas, have been threatened by funding cuts, regulatory rollbacks or cancelled permits under the Trump administration. As part of a broader rollback, the US Department of Energy cancelled more than $1 billion of clean energy project funding in Texas. Among the affected grants was a $331.9 million grant to replace natural gas with hydrogen, as well as a $270 million grant for a carbon-capture facility.

In total, funding for four of Texas’s six industrial decarbonisation projects has reportedly been rescinded. Such cuts represent just a small percentage of the total affected clean energy projects in the US. In total, estimates say around 35 privately-driven projects (such as solar farms, clean-tech manufacturing plants or battery gigafactories) have either been ‘closed, cancelled or downsized’ since Trump’s second term began.

The Republican administration also announced the cancellation of $7.6 billion in grants supporting 223 clean energy projects, ranging from hydrogen hubs, grid modernisation, solar access and industrial decarbonisation.

Rollbacks, cuts and ‘drill, baby, drill’

For Trump, a president who has claimed climate change is a ‘scam‘, a ‘hoax’ and the ‘greatest con job ever perpetrated’, tapping into the oil and gas industry seems both an agreeable and profitable decision.

Ten months on from his inauguration, Trump is still vocal about his interest in fossil fuels. Earlier this year, at the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum, Trump emphasised that fossil fuels remain central to his administration’s economic and energy framework.

While promoting clean energy in some sectors, under Trump, the US government is continuing or expanding subsidies or tax incentives benefiting the fossil fuel industry (for example, in carbon capture or relaxed royalty rates). In 2025, the US was the world’s largest oil producer. As well as this, Trump’s legislative package, titled ‘One Big Beautiful Bill’, is reported to include nearly $40 billion in new federal subsidies for fossil fuels in 2025.

On Trump’s first day in office, an executive order was signed titled ‘Unleashing American Energy’, a plan aimed to remove regulatory barriers to oil, gas and coal production. He also declared a national energy emergency, used to justify the fast-tracking of permits for oil, gas and coal projects and the loosening of climate rules viewed as obstacles. Such rules included many Biden or Obama-era climate policies and emissions regulations. For example, the administration has plans to repeal greenhouse gas limits on coal and natural gas power plants.

In addition, the US continues to invest in liquified natural gas projects, pipelines and gas infrastructure to serve global markets. In 2024, fossil fuel supply investments remained a significant share of energy investment in the US.

Another mantra purported by Trump is his infamous ‘drill, baby, drill’ slogan, intended to signal a recommitment to fossil fuels and a promise to remove constraints on exploration, mining and infrastructure development. However, despite Trump’s rhetoric, active drilling has not increased accordingly. In fact, some reports show a drop in oil and gas rigs since Trump came into power. Some argue that producers are hesitant to ramp up drilling due to fears over uncertain returns, infrastructure constraints and market dynamics.

In reality, the limits of geology, pipelines and environmental opposition mean that not every oil and gas expansion plan can go ahead.

So, what is the future?

Ultimately, the US is home to a coexistence of both clean and fossil investments. Energy systems are large-scale, long-lived projects – it’s difficult for policymakers and regulators to make the switch to clean energy overnight. Some fossil fuel investments are ‘locked in’ by existing contracts, supply chains and infrastructure, making it more difficult to navigate out of them.

Renewables, despite their prevalence, are only usable when the sun shines, or when the wind blows. Until battery storage can cover multi-day or seasonal gaps, fossil fuels and natural gas must remain to stabilise electricity supplies.

During the transition period, it’s likely that fossil fuels will continue to underpin renewables, especially since the US has spent more than a century building pipelines, refineries and power plants worth trillions of dollars – a network that the nation doesn’t necessarily want to give up just yet.

Ironically, the clean energy industry also depends on fossil fuels. Manufacturing solar panels, wind turbines, and batteries still requires fossil-fuel-derived energy and petrochemical-based materials. Cargo ships, trucks and mining equipment that deliver vital rare earth metals for batteries often run on diesel.

Running away from fossil fuels would also spell disaster for the millions of Americans who rely on the industry for jobs, revenue and community income. As such, transition policies can offer an agreeable medium.

In short, the US’s energy landscape is a complex one, made all the more difficult by climate policies that are constantly in flux.

Cox Automotive found that the new vehicle average transaction price in September was $50,800, and the average EV transaction price was $58,124.

Slate gave Design News a close-up look at a preproduction prototype so we could get an idea of what the final product will be like. The vehicle’s proportions are familiar to any of us who saw Toyota pickup trucks on the road a couple of decades ago, because the Slate pickup is exactly the same length, 174.6 inches, as the fifth-generation Toyota pickup that was in production from 1988 through 1994.

These trucks’ ubiquity was epitomized by the appearance of one as a delivery vehicle for Pizza Planet in the original Toy Story film. While the appeal of a two-seat compact pickup truck to contemporary drivers is an open question, it seems certain that companies with delivery fleets such as auto parts stores and pizza joints will value an inexpensive, bare-bones machine with low operating costs.

You might recall Dominos Pizza’s 2015 program to build its own low-cost vehicles based on the Chevrolet Spark, which was followed by the company’s 2022 adoption of Chevrolet Bolt EVs for its delivery fleet. This demonstrates the interest of such companies in having affordable, low-cost-per-mile delivery vehicles.

Here, Attorney General Neronha joins the attorneys general in Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Hawai’i, Illinois, Massachusetts, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Vermont, Washington, and the District of Columbia.","Attorney General Neronha will today join a coalition representing 22 states and the District of Columbia in suing the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin for illegally ending a $7 billion program that lowers energy costs and pollution by bringing solar energy to more than 900,000 households in low-income and disadvantaged communities across the country. This action follows a separate suit filed yesterday by the coalition in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims to recover damages for EPA’s unlawful breach of the grant agreements that were executed under this program.

“It’s clear, here and in our nearly 40 other lawsuits, that the federal government is working against, not for, the American people,” said Attorney General Neronha. “Through each of their unlawful actions, the President and his Administration have consistently demonstrated their intent to cause chaos and disruption. Here, once again, the Administration has unlawfully clawed back congressionally allocated funds from the states. These funds were already being put to good use, creating clean energy, jobs, and savings for Americans. As with Revolution Wind, this latest attack on clean energy would harm Rhode Islanders and Americans for generations to come, and we won’t sit by while it happens.”

The United States Congress created the Solar for All program in 2022 as part of the Inflation Reduction Act, directing EPA to make competitive grants to states and other entities to deploy solar projects in low-income and disadvantaged areas. EPA selected recipients and awarded all of the program funds to plaintiff states and other grant recipients by August 2024. Rhode Island and the other plaintiffs moved forward with planning projects and working with stakeholders to develop their solar programs.

But EPA abruptly and unlawfully terminated the program two months ago and clawed back the vast majority of the money already awarded, leaving the plaintiffs without access to the funds to proceed with their solar programs. In Rhode Island, the Office of Energy Resources (OER) applied for Solar for All funding and was awarded $49,330,000 in July 2024. Planning for this funding, OER proposed the launch and expansion of six financial-assistance programs and 12 project-deployment technical-assistance initiatives designed to equitably address barriers to solar adoption in Rhode Island’s low-income and disadvantaged communities. Between the various programs OER intended to offer using the funding, the Office expected to serve approximately 5,225 low-income households, reducing their electrical bills by $48,477,353. Additionally, Solar for All would have directly resulted in 27.49 MW of energy and at least 100 new green jobs.

When President Trump took office in January, he prioritized fossil fuel extraction to address an alleged “energy emergency” while arbitrarily excluding solar power as a resource that can be tapped to meet the country’s energy needs. In July, Congress passed the president’s “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” rescinding funds for the Solar for All program that were unobligated as of July 3. The effect of that move was small, given that EPA had obligated all of the $7 billion for the program nearly a year earlier.

But instead of following that newly passed law, EPA and Zeldin illegally terminated the program on August 7. On social media, Zeldin made baseless accusations, calling Solar for All a “boondoggle.” The agency then sent memos to all recipients, including the plaintiffs, saying EPA no longer has a “statutory basis or dedicated funding” for the program, even though Congress never directed EPA to cancel funds that had already been awarded. In fact, Congress did the opposite by only rescinding unobligated funds for Solar for All.

Attorney General Neronha and a multistate coalition are filing a lawsuit today in U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington, alleging, among other things, that the EPA violated the Administrative Procedure Act and the U.S. Constitution’s Separation of Powers Doctrine in unlawfully canceling the program.

Attorney General Neronha will join the attorneys general of Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Hawai’i, Illinois, Massachusetts, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Vermont, Washington, and the District of Columbia in filing this lawsuit. Also joining the complaint are the governors of Kentucky and Pennsylvania, as well as the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation.

Separately, Rhode Island joined a lawsuit that was filed yesterday in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims. In that complaint, the states and other entities argue the EPA breached the clear terms of the agreements and violated the duty of good faith and fair dealing in canceling their Solar for All grants. They are asking the court to award the plaintiffs money damages, interest, and fees.

Here, Attorney General Neronha joins the attorneys general in Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Hawai’i, Illinois, Massachusetts, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Vermont, Washington, and the District of Columbia.

The partnership reflects the increasing energy requirements of AI computing and the data centres that support it. As large-scale AI models continue to expand, maintaining stable and clean power becomes a critical operational challenge for cloud providers.

Stable power for intensive AI workloads

AI applications place unique pressure on data centre energy systems. Power usage fluctuates depending on model size and computational intensity, leading to inconsistent loads that affect efficiency and grid performance.

“AI workloads are uniquely power-intensive and highly variable, often creating swings in demand,” says Mahesh Thiagarajan, Executive Vice President of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. “By collaborating with VoltaGrid, we’re engineering innovations that dampen these swings, making AI’s power usage more stable, predictable and grid-friendly.

“VoltaGrid’s platform joins OCI’s broad energy portfolio to bolster our leading-edge AI infrastructure with dependable power that can be effortlessly scaled.”

VoltaGrid’s modular infrastructure enables Oracle to stabilise energy supply across its expanding AI footprint. The system integrates with OCI’s energy strategy to ensure continuous, on-demand power delivery while maintaining compliance with emissions standards.

The company highlights key advantages of its approach, including AI-optimised performance, high-quality power output, vertical integration for deployment speed and a design that enhances heat rejection efficiency. These features aim to address the operational and environmental pressures linked with scaling modern AI data centres.

Expanding access to clean, reliable energy

Energy Transfer, a major US energy infrastructure provider, plays a central role in the partnership. Its pipeline and storage network delivers firm natural gas supply to VoltaGrid’s new facilities, providing a dependable source of fuel for sustained operations.

This access to stable gas supply demonstrates the commercial value of Energy Transfer’s infrastructure in supporting enterprise-scale energy requirements. It also reflects the growing importance of hybrid energy solutions that balance renewable integration with reliable gas-based supply for consistent uptime.

The collaboration allows Oracle to reinforce the resilience of its AI infrastructure without relying exclusively on grid resources. In doing so, it strengthens data centre reliability across regions with increasing electricity demand caused by AI and high-performance computing growth.

Job creation and regional investment in Texas

VoltaGrid’s initiative extends beyond power delivery to include long-term investment in Texas-based manufacturing and operations. The company and its supply chain partners plan to expand production capacity across the Dallas and Houston regions, creating over 400 new manufacturing jobs.

In addition, operational growth will generate more than 350 new roles in Texas. These positions will support the ongoing expansion of VoltaGrid’s infrastructure, reinforcing local economic development while building a skilled energy and engineering workforce.

Through this collaboration, VoltaGrid aligns sustainable power technology with enterprise cloud infrastructure demands. By combining natural gas efficiency, low emissions design and responsive power systems, the partnership with Oracle aims to set a benchmark for how AI data centres manage rising energy consumption without compromising reliability or sustainability.

The initiative illustrates how energy infrastructure and cloud technology converge to meet the evolving power dynamics of AI-driven computing. For both Oracle and VoltaGrid, this cooperation represents a scalable framework for delivering efficient, grid-friendly energy to the world’s most advanced data environments.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/5e47454f2bbd9c8b19e65a3fd93cdd04:b866909d3852702f201d2a29df095543/nathan-ough-ceo-of-voltagrid.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-10-16 16:10:11.341234

Congress wanted it to be authorized for projects with medium environmental impact, but the government proposed that it be authorized only for low-impact projects.","Senate President Davi Alcolumbre (Brazil Union of Amapá) canceled the vote on the vetoes scheduled for Thursday morning (16).

“We are not negotiating veto by veto. We defend this solution that maintains the integrity of the vetoes, to avoid litigation,” João Paulo Capobianco, executive secretary of the Environment Ministry, told Valor.

In recent days, especially on Wednesday, Chief of Staff Rui Costa, Institutional Relations Minister Gleisi Hoffmann, and Environment Minister Marina Silva have stepped in to try to contain the veto override movement launched by lawmakers primarily linked to the agribusiness and infrastructure sectors. A manifesto signed by 89 business associations and released last Tuesday called for the full repeal of the vetoes.

Mr. Capobianco explains that the Executive branch’s request to postpone the congressional session, initially scheduled for this Thursday, was to avoid a “hasty vote.” “The government has formed a task force, and we are talking to several lawmakers,” he adds.

In July, Congress approved a bill, dubbed the “Devastation Bill,” which received harsh criticism from environmentalists and even from within the government, such as from the Ministry of the Environment. In response, President Lula vetoed several of the bill’s provisions in August and also sent a provisional presidential decree and a bill with constitutional urgency to Congress to replace the vetoed provisions.

For Mr. Capobianco, the bill approved three months ago posed “extremely grave risks to the environmental legislation,” which the government is now seeking to address by coordinating efforts to prevent the vetoes from being repealed. The government understands that it is necessary to maintain not only the vetoes, but also the decree and the bill it sent to Congress.

The decree creates the Special Environmental Permit (LAE)—championed by Mr. Alcolumbre—which aims to expedite strategic projects with government approval, establishing a maximum licensing deadline of one year. The idea is that the new procedures can accelerate the licensing of large projects, such as oil exploration in the mouth of the Amazon River, in the Equatorial Margin—which covers the coast of Amapá, the Senate president’s home state.

The bill, which had constitutional procedural urgency (45 days to be approved in both the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate, but this deadline has since been waived), amended controversial details approved by lawmakers, such as the License by Adhesion and Commitment (LAC), which established self-declared licensing procedures. Congress wanted it to be authorized for projects with medium environmental impact, but the government proposed that it be authorized only for low-impact projects. Both are progressing slowly in Congress.",https://s2-valorinternational.glbimg.com/RKZulb_IAx4wqauu7-z5yIb3VBU=/1200x/smart/filters:cover():strip_icc()/i.s3.glbimg.com/v1/AUTH_63b422c2caee4269b8b34177e8876b93/internal_photos/bs/2021/7/4/5tBl3dSBKcirSBAhUgng/061221joaopaulo009.jpg,N,,2025-10-16 16:09:39.721835

But they are 14 points less likely than the oldest Republicans to support expanding nuclear power (61% vs. 75%).
Why Americans favor or oppose expanding nuclear power in their own words We also asked Americans to share the main reason they favor or oppose more nuclear power in their own words.
For instance, one respondent wrote: “Nuclear power plants tend to set radiation off and it destroys our environment.” A look at U.S. nuclear power reactors The U.S. currently has 94 nuclear power reactors, including one that opened in Georgia last year.","About six-in-ten U.S. adults now say they favor more nuclear power plants to generate electricity, according to a Pew Research Center survey fielded in April and May. That’s up from 43% in 2020, driven by increasing support among both Republicans and Democrats.

The Trump administration and Democrats and Republicans in Congress support expanding nuclear power. The second Trump administration has issued four executive orders aimed at dramatically increasing the United States’s nuclear capacity. And a major law President Donald Trump signed in July 2025 preserved many tax incentives for nuclear power.

Americans remain more likely to favor expanding solar (77%) and wind power (68%) than nuclear power (59%). But while support for solar and wind power has declined by double digits since 2020 – largely driven by drops in Republican support – the share who favor nuclear power has grown by 16 percentage points since then.

How we did this

To measure public attitudes toward the use of nuclear power in the United States, we analyzed our prior data from Pew Research Center surveys. Most of the data comes from a survey of 5,085 U.S. adults conducted April 28-May 4, 2025.

Everyone who took part in the survey is a member of the Center’s American Trends Panel (ATP), a group of people recruited through national, random sampling of residential addresses who have agreed to take surveys regularly. This kind of recruitment gives nearly all U.S. adults a chance of selection. Interviews were conducted either online or by telephone with a live interviewer. The survey is weighted to be representative of the U.S. adult population by gender, race, ethnicity, partisan affiliation, education and other categories. Read more about the ATP’s methodology.

Here are the survey questions used for this analysis, the topline and the survey methodology.

In addition, we tracked the number of U.S. nuclear power reactors over time by analyzing data from the International Atomic Energy Agency’s (IAEA) Power Reactor Information System. The IAEA classifies a reactor as “operational” from the date of its first electrical grid connection to the date of its permanent shutdown. Reactors that face temporary outages are still categorized as operational. Annual totals exclude reactors that closed that year.

Views by gender

Attitudes on nuclear power production have long differed by gender.

In our April-May survey, men remain far more likely than women to favor expanding nuclear power plants to generate electricity in the U.S. (74% vs. 44%). This pattern holds among adults in both political parties.

Views on nuclear energy differ by gender globally, too, according to a Center survey conducted from fall 2019 to spring 2020. In 18 of the 20 places surveyed, men were more likely than women to favor using more nuclear power as a source of domestic energy.

Views by party

Republicans are more likely than Democrats to favor expanding nuclear power to generate electricity in the U.S. Roughly seven-in-ten Republicans and Republican-leaning independents (69%) say they favor this, compared with about half of Democrats and Democratic leaners (52%).

Republicans have supported nuclear power in greater shares than Democrats each time we’ve asked this question since 2016.

The partisan gap in support for nuclear power (17 percentage points) is smaller than those for other types of energy, including fossil fuel sources such as offshore oil and gas drilling (52-point gap) and coal mining (50 points).

Americans in both parties see nuclear power more positively now than they did earlier this decade. The share of Democrats who favor expanding it is up 15 points since 2020, and Republican support has grown by 16 points.

While younger Republicans tend to be more supportive of increasing domestic renewable energy sources than their older peers, the pattern reverses for nuclear energy. For example, Republicans under 30 are more likely than those ages 65 and older to favor more solar panel farms (69% vs. 53%). But they are 14 points less likely than the oldest Republicans to support expanding nuclear power (61% vs. 75%).

Why Americans favor or oppose expanding nuclear power in their own words

We also asked Americans to share the main reason they favor or oppose more nuclear power in their own words.

Among those who favor more nuclear power, the most common reason why is that it is a clean or low-carbon way of producing energy (40%). As two respondents wrote:

“[Nuclear power plants] are currently the only carbon-free form of power generation capable of producing large amounts of power efficiently, and without the downside of being dependent on weather conditions.”

“They are a clean source of energy that can produce a massive amount of energy for the amount of money and time invested in them.”

Some of those who favor more nuclear power also say this because it is efficient (20%) or safe (13%):

“We’ve learned to maintain safety with nuclear power. (Think of military usages such as submarines and aircraft carriers.) It’s clean and waste can be safely handled.”

Other reasons highlighted include economic benefits (13%), reliability (10%) and the need for more varied energy sources (9%) as reasons they support nuclear power.

Among those who oppose more nuclear power, safety concerns are the most common reason (44%). This includes respondents who say nuclear power is generally not safe, mention risks of catastrophe and risks to human health.

“If something were to go wrong, it could be catastrophic.”

“[Nuclear power plants] are dangerous, and I don’t trust humans to be responsible enough to take the necessary safety precautions.”

Other reasons for opposing nuclear power include general concerns about its environmental impact (14%) and specific concerns about toxic waste (14%). For instance, one respondent wrote:

“Nuclear power plants tend to set radiation off and it destroys our environment.”

A look at U.S. nuclear power reactors

The U.S. currently has 94 nuclear power reactors, including one that opened in Georgia last year. Reactors collectively generated 18.2% of all U.S. electricity that came from utility-scale facilities in 2024, according to preliminary data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

About half of the United States’s nuclear power reactors (48) are in the South, while nearly a quarter (22) are in the Midwest. There are 18 reactors in the Northeast and six in the West, according to data from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).

The number of U.S. reactors has fallen since peaking at 111 in 1990. Nine Mile Point-1 – located in Scriba, New York – is the oldest U.S. nuclear power reactor still in operation. It first connected to the power grid in November 1969.

Most of the 94 current reactors began operations in the 1970s (41) or 1980s (44), IAEA data shows. (The IAEA classifies reactors as “operational” from their first electrical grid connection to their date of permanent shutdown.)

Within the last decade, eight reactors shut down, and just three new reactors joined the power fleet.

One of the many reasons nuclear power projects have dwindled in recent decades may be the perceived dangers following nuclear accidents in the U.S. and abroad. For example, the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi accident led the Japanese government and other countries to rethink their nuclear energy plans. High construction costs and radioactive waste storage are also often-cited hurdles to nuclear energy development.

Still, many advocates say that nuclear power is key to reducing emissions from electricity generation.

Attorney General Mayes is spearheading both lawsuits after a long career of fighting for renewable energy and subsequent cost-savings for Arizona consumers.
While serving as a Republican Commissioner and Commission Chair on the Arizona Corporation Commission, Attorney General Mayes co-authored Arizona’s renewable energy standards.","PHOENIX — Attorney General Kris Mayes and several other plaintiffs are suing the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin for illegally ending a $7 billion program that lowers energy costs and pollution by bringing solar energy to more than 900,000 households in low-income and disadvantaged communities across the country.

Arizona and other grant recipients also filed suit yesterday in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims to recover damages for EPA’s unlawful breach of grant agreements that were executed under this program.

“Beyond the fact that this energy infrastructure funding has already been appropriated to our state and is owed to Arizonans, protecting solar projects and lower electricity bills is personal to me,” said Attorney General Mayes. “Arizona families are already facing sky-high electricity bills, and I will not let the EPA wriggle out of its commitment to fund solar energy projects that would lower costs for more than 900,000 Arizona households.”

Congress created the Solar for All program in 2022 as part of the Inflation Reduction Act, directing EPA to make competitive grants to states and other entities to deploy solar projects in low-income and disadvantaged areas. EPA selected recipients and, by August 2024, had awarded all of the program funds to the plaintiff states and other grant recipients. Arizona and the other plaintiffs moved forward with planning projects and working with stakeholders to develop their solar programs.

But EPA abruptly and unlawfully terminated the program two months ago and clawed back the vast majority of the money already awarded. That has left Arizona and the other plaintiffs without access to the funds to proceed with their solar programs, after the states spent significant time and resources planning and launching programs. . In 2024, EPA awarded the state of Arizona a nearly $156 million grant to establish its Solar for All Arizonans program, designed to add affordable and reliable distributed electricity generation to Arizona’s grid.

Had Arizona been able to implement its EPA-approved plans, the Solar for All Arizonan program would have brought substantial benefits to program participants and to the State, including creating $165 million in bill savings for participating households, thousands of new, good-paying jobs throughout Arizona’s solar industry and 61 megawatts of new solar deployment, all while preventing at least 96,000 tons of CO2 from entering Arizona’s atmosphere each year.

The Hopi Tribe, through its Hopi Utilities Corporation, also received a $25 million Solar for All grant to install solar panels and battery storage in homes across the Hopi Reservation in Northeastern Arizona.The Solar for All program would have improved energy access for nearly 600 Hopi homes, many of which had never before had access to electricity.

When President Trump took office this past January, he prioritized fossil fuel extraction to address an alleged “energy emergency” while arbitrarily excluding solar power as a resource that can be tapped to meet the country’s energy needs. In July, Congress passed the president’s “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” rescinding funds for the Solar for All program that were unobligated as of July 3. The effect of that move was small, given that EPA had obligated all of the $7 billion for the program nearly a year earlier.

But instead of following that newly passed law, EPA and Zeldin illegally terminated the program on August 7. On social media, Zeldin made baseless accusations, calling Solar for All a “boondoggle.” The agency then sent memos to all recipients, including the plaintiffs, saying EPA no longer has a “statutory basis or dedicated funding” for the program, even though Congress never directed EPA to cancel funds that had already been awarded. In fact, Congress did the opposite by only rescinding unobligated funds for Solar for All.

Attorney General Mayes and several other plaintiffs are filing a lawsuit today in U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington, alleging, among other things, that the EPA violated the Administrative Procedure Act and the U.S. Constitution’s Separation of Powers Doctrine in unlawfully cancelling the program.

Attorney General Mayes and the attorneys general of Minnesota and Washington, are leading this complaint, which is being joined by the attorneys general of California, Colorado, Connecticut, the District of Columbia, Hawaiʻi, Illinois, Massachusetts, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island, and Vermont. Also joining the complaint are the governors of Kentucky and Pennsylvania, as well as the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation.

Separately, Arizona co-led a lawsuit that was filed yesterday in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims. In that complaint, the states and other entities argue the EPA breached the clear terms of the agreements and violated the duty of good faith and fair dealing in canceling their Solar for All grants. They’re asking the court to award the plaintiffs money damages, interest, and fees.

Markey has for decades been among the Hill’s loudest voices on climate and other green issues.
It’s hard to name many folks who have done more for these issues than Sen. Markey,” Craig Auster, LCV’s vice president of political affairs, said in an interview.
He mentioned a commitment to fighting climate change numerous times in his campaign launch.
“Sunrise Movement helped Markey win the youth vote, win the internet, and define himself as the clear progressive choice in this race,” Varshini Prakash, Sunrise’s executive director at the time, said after Markey’s primary victory.","Democratic Massachusetts Sen. Ed Markey is getting help from some old friends in the environmental movement as he looks to defend his seat from a new primary challenger.

Markey fended off a challenge from then-Rep. Joe Kennedy III in 2020 with the help of greens. They’re vowing to mobilize again now that Rep. Seth Moulton announced he’ll take on Markey, who has spent five decades in Congress.

Moulton, 46, is directly challenging Markey over his age, framing his campaign as one for generational change. Markey, 79, would be 86 at the end of his term if he wins reelection next year.

“I don’t think someone who’s been in Congress for half a century is the right person to meet this moment and win the future,” Moulton said in a video announcing his candidacy. “Sen. Markey’s a good man. But it’s time for a new generation of leadership, and that’s why I’m running for U.S. Senate.”

But beyond age, the environment will be prominent in the contest. Markey has for decades been among the Hill’s loudest voices on climate and other green issues.

Weeks before Moulton launched his bid, Markey scored a key endorsement from the League of Conservation Voters, an electoral juggernaut. The group and its affiliates spent $165 million in the 2024 electoral cycle.

“He’s someone who’s been leading on these issues and fighting for his whole career. It’s hard to name many folks who have done more for these issues than Sen. Markey,” Craig Auster, LCV’s vice president of political affairs, said in an interview.

“I think voters are going to see that and know that Sen. Markey is on the front lines fighting for them and the things that are important to them, including clean energy and climate,” Auster continued.

“We especially in this awful time need somebody like Sen. Markey who’s not afraid of a tough fight and who always keeps what’s important at the top of his agenda, fighting for his constituents and the environment.”

The Sunrise Movement wrote on X in response to Moulton’s launch video: “Sorry, but you are one of the ‘leaders’ refusing to stand up to Trump — and you’re trying to unseat one of the people in Congress who has done the most to fight back against Trump.”

Markey’s green history

Markey is perhaps known best for the “American Clean Energy and Security Act,” which would have instituted a nationwide cap-and-trade system for greenhouse gas emissions, when he was in the House. He co-wrote the bill with then-Rep. Henry Waxman (D-Calif.). The legislation passed the House, but the Senate never passed its own version.

Later, Markey was the chief Senate sponsor of the Green New Deal, which he introduced in 2019 alongside Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.). It seeks a rapid decarbonization of the U.S. economy, with universal health care and guarantees of jobs and housing.

He notched some key wins in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, including the $27 billion Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund; $3 billion in environmental block grants; and millions for air pollution censors, energy efficient glass, offshore wind and more.

Many of those programs, however, were later undone in the Republicans’ One Big Beautiful Bill Act this year or via clawbacks by the Trump administration.

Markey has tried to get ahead of the question of his age. In an interview with Boston ABC News affiliate WCVB last year in which he announced he’d run for reelection, he said, “It’s not your age, it’s the age of your ideas.

“And I’ve always been the youngest guy in the room, working on the Green New Deal, on climate change, to make sure that the funding is there for wind and solar, all electric vehicles,” he continued.

Moulton dings Dem leaders

Moulton is likely to campaign as a centrist alternative to Markey. His launch video extensively criticized Democratic leadership, saying that “real people across Massachusetts are being hurt by Democratic leaders refusing to do everything they can to win.”

Moulton challenged Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) for the position of speaker after the 2018 midterm elections, and ran in the 2020 presidential election. He’s emphasized bipartisanship and bucked Democrats on numerous occasions, including criticizing the party for its transgender rights positions following the 2024 elections.

Moulton also was an early supporter of the Green New Deal in the House. He mentioned a commitment to fighting climate change numerous times in his campaign launch.

“Let’s talk about our children and the future that will be left for them if we don’t protect our democracy and tackle climate change,” he said, later saying children “need us to get back on the offensive when it comes to banning assault weapons and fighting climate change” and boasting about the climate impact of high-speed rail legislation he’s proposed.

A recent University of New Hampshire poll found that 42 percent of voters think Markey deserves reelection, and 39 percent say he doesn’t.

Another poll, released by the conservative Fiscal Alliance Foundation, had Moulton ahead of Markey by a margin of 43 percent to 21 percent among all likely voters, but a smaller gap of 38 percent to 30 percent among Democrats.

Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.) hasn’t ruled out running in the Senate primary.

Climate activists — particularly the youth-centric Sunrise Movement — were key to Markey’s vicory against Kennedy.

The group, which is the main backer of the Green New Deal, activated its chapters across Massachusetts in support of Markey, making hundreds of thousands of calls, hosting virtual and in-person events, promoting him extensively on social media, and more. The senator’s appearances throughout the campaign in a bomber jacket and red Nike sneakers endeared him to the young activists.

“Sunrise Movement helped Markey win the youth vote, win the internet, and define himself as the clear progressive choice in this race,” Varshini Prakash, Sunrise’s executive director at the time, said after Markey’s primary victory.

Markey called his win “a tribute to those young people and to their vision.”

It helped move Markey from a 14-percentage-point polling deficit in a Boston Globe/Suffolk University poll a year before the primary to an 11-percentage-point win over Kennedy.

Markey easily won the general election with twice as many votes as his Republican opponent, Kevin O’Connor.",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/0c/31/a63c6e334626962d4550f8d883ed/congress-tax-cuts-25536.jpg,N,,2025-10-16 14:08:11.082493

By Kyle Stock

Americans bought 438,500 electric cars and trucks in the third quarter, as drivers raced to grab federal incentives before they expired Sept. 30.

Those transactions, the highest number in a single quarter, comprised 11% of all new car sales, eclipsing the previous high point of 8.7%, according to Cox Automotive, a services and technology company.

A crowd of more affordable cars next year could help maintain the momentum, but analysts expect EV transactions to dip in the months ahead without federal tax credits.

Stephanie Valdez Streaty, Cox Director of Industry Insights, said in a report EVs could account for one quarter of all new US car sales by 2030. That’s “well short of the 50% once envisioned, but certainly moving out of the ‘niche’ category.”

The sales tally underscores a tricky dynamic for auto executives and clean-air advocates: Millions of Americans want EVs, but relatively high prices remain a speed bump to adoption.

Tesla still dominates the US market for EVs and managed a small sales gain in the recent quarter after months of skidding results. However, a crowd of rivals is closing the gap quickly, shrinking Tesla’s share of the EV pie to 41% from 80% four years ago.

General Motors, in particular, is gaining electric speed. The company captured 15% of EV sales in the quarter, led by its new Chevrolet Equinox, the third best-selling battery-powered machine. That’s up from 10% in the year-earlier period.

Source: Cox Automotive Inc.

Nearly half of US EV purchases in the first half of the year were made without any federal incentive, according to BloombergNEF. And there are now at least 11 EVs in the US with starting prices below that of the average car purchase. Chevrolet’s Equinox can be had for about $35,000, for example, and the brand just released a new version of its Bolt with a price tag of $29,000.

The road ahead for EVs, however, looks rocky, at least for a little while. Without federal credits, BloombergNEF forecasts 27% of the US market will be electric by 2030, down from the 48% share it estimated a year ago. In the current quarter, S&P Global expects EVs to comprise less than 7% of new car sales.

“The affordability issue is going to be exacerbated,” said Peter Nagle, an associate director at S&P. “It’s really going to be a sink or swim moment.”

The other way to buy a cheap EV

34%

The year-over-year uptick in used EV sales. Pre-owned electric cars and trucks in America are now almost as cheap as used gas-powered vehicles, on average, and are selling even faster, according to Cox Automotive.

Volvo’s strategy

“Volvo will be stronger if we electrify fast. But we need new plug-in hybrids — electric cars with a backup engine — as a bridge until charging is everywhere.”

Hakan Samuelsson

Chief executive officer, Volvo

Samuelsson also told Bloomberg that said his company will take a “huge step” next year in offering EVs with longer driving ranges and lower prices.

According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, 2024 data pulled from the National Association of State Budget Officers states that gas tax revenue accounts for 35.9% of state transportation department revenue nationwide.
To tackle the issue of reduced gas tax revenue, many states have begun taking measures and implementing programs that will generate revenue from electric vehicles instead.","Electric vehicles are more popular than ever, with 21% of new car sales in the United States being either electric, hybrid, or plug-in hybrid models. One of the unintended consequences of this consumer trend is the effect on gas tax revenue.

Every gasoline and diesel sale in the U.S. includes a small added tax. This tax is used to fund state transportation budgets, highway maintenance, and infrastructure projects. As a result of more EVs on the road, the amount of revenue generated by the gas tax is decreasing. This has created interesting financial repercussions, and a variety of solutions are being adopted to help.

Using state-by-state fuel tax data from the Department of Energy and consumer EV trends from the Alternative Fuels Data Center, CheapInsurance.com analyzed the economic impact of the changing transportation landscape and what’s being done to remedy the situation.

Nationwide EV adoption trends

Millions of Americans are choosing to purchase electric vehicles over traditional gas ones. The reasons include reduced charging costs compared to gas, lower emissions, and tax incentives.

The Bureau of Transportation Statistics reported that, in 2024, there were 1.2 million electric vehicle sales and 1.6 million hybrid electric vehicle sales. This is up from 238,000 EV sales and 455,000 hybrid-electric sales in 2020. This upward trend is likely to continue.

New EV registrations by state

The rate at which EVs are being bought and put on the road differs by state. This is mainly influenced by government policies, cultural attitudes, and economic factors.

For example, California has recently tried to enact an EV mandate that requires a certain percentage of new vehicle sales to be fully electric. This plan was then adopted by 11 other states. Although later blocked by the Senate, this prompted many consumers to transition to EVs.

Culturally, many Americans across the country do not want EVs, which explains lower purchase numbers in some states. The Pew Research Center found that, in May 2025, only 18% of Republicans and Republican-leaning individuals were at least somewhat interested in purchasing one. This is compared to Democrats, with 48% somewhat or very interested. This data was collected via a survey of Americans conducted from April 28 to May 4, 2025. This suggests that “red states” will have lower numbers of EV registrations than “blue states.”

A look at gas tax revenue loss in key EV states

The states with the highest EV registration numbers per 100,000 residents have the most significant loss in gas tax revenue. The number of EV vehicles on the road compared to gasoline vehicles is still quite low, so impacts are not being strongly felt yet. However, many states are predicting substantial losses in their gas tax revenue over the next decade.

In California, for example, the Mineta Transportation Institute predicts that there will be a 64% loss in revenue from 2025 to 2040. In this study, researchers considered eight different scenarios, each with a different rate of how many EVs are purchased, how many people in the state drive, and how many personal vehicles get registered. Results used 2024 inflation-adjusted numbers.

Budget impacts on state transportation departments

Millions of dollars in losses will have a severe impact on state highway and transportation departments if left unaddressed. According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, 2024 data pulled from the National Association of State Budget Officers states that gas tax revenue accounts for 35.9% of state transportation department revenue nationwide.

Without this revenue, several impacts will be felt:

Deficits in highway and road maintenance

Slower completion of infrastructure projects

Less development and expansion

Higher vehicle maintenance costs for the general population

How states are responding and planning for the future

States are recognizing that action needs to be taken to secure transportation budgets. Pew Research Center reports that many states are suffering from budget gaps and are having difficulty completing projects like bridge repairs.

To tackle the issue of reduced gas tax revenue, many states have begun taking measures and implementing programs that will generate revenue from electric vehicles instead.

EV registration fees

The most significant way that governmental bodies have buoyed transportation department revenue is with EV registration fees. These fees are charged at the initial time of registration and on an annual basis.

In Texas, for example, EV owners must pay $400 for the first-time registration and $200 each year, according to the Department of Energy.

Road usage charges

Other states are opting for a road usage fee. In Hawai‘i, EV owners are given the option to pay an annual, per-mile usage fee instead of a large registration fee. This is currently set at $0.08/mile, up to $50/year.

Oregon offers a similar program, called OReGO. California is also experimenting with its own pilot program.

What changes are needed on the road ahead?

It’s clear that policy change is needed to address the compounding loss in gas tax revenue as a result of widespread EV adoption. The amount of revenue that will need to be replaced is unclear, however, especially with an anticipated decline in EV demand due to the federal tax incentives ending.

Regardless, state agencies and the federal government will need to prioritize alternative methods for generating revenue. This could be through registration fees, road usage programs, or other revenue-generating systems that are put into place. It’s likely that the EV marketplace will continue to grow and that more households will begin replacing their gas vehicles, so prompt change is needed in the coming years.

Dive Brief:

General Motors’ Audit Committee approved a $1.6 billion impairment charge on Oct. 7 as part of a strategic realignment of its electric vehicle manufacturing capacity owing to slower-than-expected demand, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing.

The charges include $1.2 billion in non-cash impairments and $400 million in cash costs for contract cancellations and settlements related to the automaker’s previous EV investment strategy.

In addition to slower-than-expected EV demand, GM cited recent changes to government policies, a rollback of emissions regulations and the Sept. 30 elimination of the federal EV tax credit as factors contributing to the impairment charge.

Dive Insight:

GM’s significant impairment charge highlights the auto industry’s vulnerability to sudden regulatory and policy shifts administered by the Trump Administration, including the impact of new tariffs on steel, aluminum and other auto parts that prompted GM and other automakers to reevaluate their supply chains. Earlier this year, GM revised its 2025 earnings guidance, which reflects an anticipated $4 billion to $5 billion impact in 2025 from tariffs on imported automobiles and parts.

GM also stated in its SEC filing that the reassessment of its EV manufacturing capacity, which includes battery component manufacturing in the U.S., is ongoing and may result in future cash and non-cash charges that may impact its revenue and cash flows. However, any changes to GM’s EV capacity will not affect the current retail portfolio of Chevrolet, GMC and Cadillac EVs currently in production. The automaker expects that these models will remain available to consumers.

GM unveiled its redesigned Chevrolet Bolt on Oct. 9, with an MSRP of under $30,000, which may boost its appeal. The Bolt and Equinox EVs are expected to account for a majority of the brand’s EV volume in 2026, the automaker said in the release.

Previously, GM made significant investments in EV development to comply with emissions and fuel economy regulations that were scheduled to become increasingly more stringent through 2032.

In January 2022, GM announced it would invest $7 billion across four Michigan plants to expand production of battery cells and electric trucks. However, because of current market conditions, the automaker has revised those plans and is making investments to support production of its highly profitable truck and SUV portfolio.

In May, GM announced plans to invest $888 million in its Tonawanda Propulsion plant in Buffalo, New York, to support production of a next-generation V8 gas engine for its full-size trucks and SUVs. The planned investment is GM’s largest-ever commitment in an engine manufacturing plant.

In June, GM also announced plans to invest roughly $4 billion in its U.S. assembly plants in three states over the next two years, to boost domestic output of both gas and electric vehicles.

Looking ahead, GM expects its annual capital spending to be between $10 billion and $12 billion through 2027, reflecting its increased investments to boost its U.S. manufacturing capacity.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/6pvhDNUPE4rNA21QD95J9lQiJevSRe5yX2YorMiwBek/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9nYnMuanBn.webp,N,,2025-10-16 13:04:25.042801

Yaw. “State mandates and artificial price controls distort those markets, discourage investment and ultimately drive-up costs. PJM should remain focused on preserving the current structure and reject these misguided and short-sighted recommendations that undermine reliability and affordability.""

The letter, addressed to PJM President and CEO Manu Asthana, responds directly to the National Caucus of Environmental Legislators’ September 29th letter, which called for PJM to accelerate the connection of wind and solar projects.

[Editor’s Note: The September 29 letter was signed by 107 state lawmakers from the PJM region. Read more here.

[Utility Dive reported Jeffrey Shields, a PJM spokesman, said in an email that PJM has testified to Congress twice this year that it will need all available capacity, including renewable energy, to meet its resource adequacy needs. Read more here.

[The Solar Energy Industries Association reported Congressional Republican cuts to federal funding for renewable energy projects has resulted in blocking 125 gigawatts of solar power from getting to the grid. Read more here.

[The only fuel promoted by PA Republicans has been natural gas which is already used to fire 60% of the state’s electric generation capacity. Read more here.

[The overreliance on this one fuel, instead of a diverse generation fuel mix, is causing steadily increasing electricity prices. Read more here.]

Sen. Yaw and his colleagues warn that favoring these intermittent sources over proven baseload generation resources like natural gas, coal and nuclear would jeopardize grid stability and increase costs for ratepayers.

[Editor’s Note: Rep. Thomas Mehaffie (R-Dauphin) said at a May House hearing-- “[Natural] gas is not baseload power. Read more here.

[“Baseload power means that you have ample fuel supply for over three months [on site]. So coal and nuke are the only two that are baseload power on demand.

[“And I get there's plenty of gas out there, but that's all on demand. They can shut it off and turn it on as they want, but that fuel supply is not there for them,” said Rep. Mehaffie, [As we have seen in multiple severe winter weather events.] Read more here.]

[Locking Up Existing Electric Generation

[Editor’s Note: Not addressed in the Senators’ letter is the fact that multiple, existing gas, nuclear and hydroelectric plants in Pennsylvania are being locked up for the exclusive use of A.I. data centers and effectively taken off the grid. Read more here.

[Power from all five Pennsylvania’s nuclear power plants is being locked up for exclusive use by A.I. data centers: Three Mile Island (the project that started the data center “power stampede”), Beaver Valley, Peach Bottom, Susquehanna Station and Limerick.

[The July Pittsburgh A.I. Summit alone included announcements of multiple power plant deals for existing power plants and announcements of new power plants being developed exclusively for data centers, not “ordinary people” and the grid. Read more here.]

The legislators encouraged PJM to carefully weigh long-term impacts of any market changes, enact rigorous project feasibility standards and conduct deeper industry analysis before adopting any sweeping changes.

Human activities, mainly the burning of coal, oil and gas for energy, have been driving carbon dioxide concentrations higher and higher for more than half a century. This has warmed Earth rapidly, as carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases cause energy from the sun to remain trapped near the planet’s surface. Last year was Earth’s hottest year in recorded history.

Human-caused emissions remained the major driver of the record recent jump in carbon dioxide levels, the largest since modern measurements began in 1957, according to the organization, which is the weather and climate agency of the United Nations.

In 2024, the atmosphere’s average concentration of the gas reached 423.9 parts per million, an increase of 3.5 parts per million from the year before. That edged out a 3.3 parts per million increase in 2016 that was previously the largest ever measured. Year-to-year rises in carbon dioxide concentrations have accelerated since the 1960s, when the average pace of increase was 0.8 parts per million.

An uptick in emissions from wildfires was likely to have played a role in 2024’s record jump, as was decreased absorption of carbon dioxide by the land and the ocean, the agency said. Severe drought and forest fires can degrade the ability of soil and plants to draw down carbon dioxide from the atmosphere while rising ocean temperatures lessen seawater’s capacity to harbor the gas.

Carbon dioxide that is not absorbed by the land or by the seas can remain in the atmosphere for centuries, influencing the climate long after its original release into the skies.

The U.S. Department of Energy’s Loan Programs Office said Thursday it has closed a $1.6 billion loan guarantee to a subsidiary of American Electric Power to reconductor and rebuild around 5,000 miles of transmission lines across Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Oklahoma, and West Virginia.

The conditional loan commitment was announced in January as part of $23 billion in assistance DOE offered to eight utilities for investments in transmission, energy storage, grid modernization and gas pipelines.

The Trump administration has been reviewing loan commitments and grants finalized in the waning days of the Biden administration, charging that many were rushed through with inadequate review. Energy Secretary Chris Wright said the AEP loan will bolster reliability and “ensure lower electricity costs across the Midwestern region of the United States.”

Dive Insight:

DOE did not immediately respond to questions about the status of other loan guarantees announced in January. AEP is the first company to close a loan guarantee under the Energy Dominance Financing Program created by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. President Trump signed the legislation into law earlier this year.

The guarantee “was carefully evaluated” under new LPO guidance and “delivers on the Trump administration’s promise to responsibly steward taxpayer dollars and unleash American energy dominance,” DOE said in a statement.

AEP is “experiencing growth in energy demand that has not been seen in a generation,” President, CEO and Chairman Bill Fehrman said in a statement.

Customers have committed to 24 GW of electricity demand by the end of the decade, AEP said, and necessary upgrades have been identified to support data center, artificial intelligence and manufacturing development.

Approximately 100 miles of transmission line across Ohio and Oklahoma are the first projects supported by the loan guarantee, AEP said; additional funding and projects will follow.

“This loan saves our customers money and improves reliability while supporting economic growth in our states,” AEP said. “The funds we will save through this program enable us to make additional investments to enhance service for our customers.”

Electric utilities receiving an Energy Dominance Financing loan “must provide assurance to DOE that financial benefits from the financing will be passed on to the customers of that utility,” DOE said.

The loan guarantee, to AEP Transmission, will save customers “an estimated $275 million in financing costs over the life of the loan,” the company said. The company estimated about 1,100 construction jobs will be created through the projects.

“Seeking federal funding opportunities and implementing rate structures that ensure new large customers are supporting infrastructure investment are some of the ways AEP is working to reduce rate impacts for customers,” the company said.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/nSSb2mX-b_TcZrFo234vB_X6Jnajdx3wt06w539wyXM/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy05MDY2MTk0MS5qcGc=.webp,N,,2025-10-16 12:12:03.099159

Data centers in other parts of the country have already skyrocketed some Americans’ electric bills, as utilities must rapidly build more power plants and transmission lines to compensate for the soaring demand. The issue has come up as part of the complex rate case of Florida Power & Light, giving state utility regulators the chance to set guardrails that could set a precedent for Duke Energy Florida and Tampa Electric.

When Florida Power & Light first filed its request to hike base rates, it asked to collect nearly $10 billion more from customers over the next four years. Embedded in that petition was also how it proposed to address data centers: It would require tech companies to pay a minimum bill representing 90% of their expected energy costs. That way, if a data center’s consumption fell short, residents wouldn’t be required to cover the gap incurred by the utility building up its infrastructure to accommodate the facility.

But consumer advocates have fiercely fought the overall proposal, which is believed to be the largest rate hike request in American history. In response, Florida Power & Light, along with other parties in the case — many of them business interests, like a federation of retail companies, industrial corporations and Walmart — proposed a settlement deal that would lower the overall rate increase to around $7 billion. It would also reduce the minimum bill requirement for data centers to 70% of their expected energy costs.

The utility’s chief executive officer, Armando Pimentel, said during the hearings that having data centers come to Florida could benefit all customers, because costs would be spread out among more users.

“We wanted to provide something that was attractive enough to data centers ... so they would take a look at Florida,” he said, adding he didn’t think the change sacrificed customer protections.

James Wilson, an economist and business consultant specializing in data centers, testified Wednesday that the fact Florida Power & Light is proactively proposing data center tariffs is “really a good thing.”

But Wilson told regulators that the company should raise the minimum bill back to 90%, or at least 80%, to mirror what other utilities are doing nationwide. Wilson testified on behalf of the Legislature-appointed consumer advocate, the Office of the Public Counsel, which is opposed to the company’s proposed settlement. Two other groups representing residential customers are also against the deal, saying it caters to big business.

“I think the question you have to ask is, ‘Why?’” Wilson said. “‘Why would prospective data center customers be pushing for 70%?’”

He added that major tech companies like Google, Microsoft, Meta and Amazon work hard to maintain their public image and are unlikely to “push for shifting a lot of the cost and risk of what they’re doing to residential customers,” raising questions about which companies are participating in this case.

Supporting the deal is the Florida Energy for Innovation Association, which its lawyer, D. Bruce May, said represents companies that have signed confidential agreements with Florida Power & Light to explore building data centers in the state. He has not publicly disclosed the names of the companies.

May said that the group supports the 70% minimum bills, adding that they will still “ensure the integrity of our grid and protect the general body of ratepayers from having to subsidize data centers.”

Gov. Ron DeSantis, who appointed all of the utility regulators on the Florida Public Service Commission, recently opined about who should bear the costs of data centers’ resource needs.

“I’m on the side of protecting the hardworking people of this state,” DeSantis said at an event last month. “If someone wants to build a business or build something like that, they’ve got to do it on their own dime. It should not be subsidized by everybody else having to pay up the nose for the necessities of life.”

Lawyers and utility regulators have gathered for grueling, all-day hearings in the Florida Power & Light rate case for the past week and a half. The proceedings resemble a court trial, with company executives providing sworn testimony on the witness stand.

Those hearings are scheduled to end Friday, with regulators expected to make a final decision on the rate hikes around the end of the year.

“The President has been clear: America must reverse course from the energy subtraction agenda of past administrations and strengthen our electrical grid,” Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in a press release.
The Trump administration has slashed far more than just the Grain Belt Express’ funding.
Since taking office, Trump has yanked billions in Biden-era loans and grants for clean-energy projects and clawed back incentives for the sector in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.","The Department of Energy has closed a $1.6 billion loan guarantee for transmission upgrades in the middle of the country — a move that comes as the Trump administration slashes funding for other grid improvements, including a separate transmission megaproject in the Midwest.

The financing from the Department of Energy’s Loan Programs Office will go to a subsidiary of utility giant American Electric Power to overhaul around 5,000 miles of power lines across Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Oklahoma, and West Virginia. The agency called the deal ​“the first closed loan guarantee” under a new ​“Energy Dominance Financing Program” established by President Donald Trump’s landmark tax law, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

Despite the Energy Dominance branding, the loan guarantee was originally announced in mid-January by the Biden administration as part of a broader $22.4 billion push to strengthen the grid using LPO funding. The Trump administration has now finalized that loan in a rare example of continuity between the administrations on energy policy.

In a statement, the Energy Department said that ​“all electric utilities receiving an EDF loan must provide assurance to DOE that financial benefits from the financing will be passed on to the customers of that utility.” A spokesperson for the agency did not immediately respond to Canary Media’s email requesting comment on how those assurances will be monitored and enforced.

“The President has been clear: America must reverse course from the energy subtraction agenda of past administrations and strengthen our electrical grid,” Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in a press release. ​“This loan guarantee will not only help modernize the grid and expand transmission capacity but will help position the United States to win the AI race and grow our manufacturing base.”

The United States needs more transmission lines to upgrade the aging grid, create room for additional power generation, and increase reliability by making it easier to share electrons across regions. Much of the U.S. grid was built in the 1960s and 1970s, and about 70% of existing transmission lines are over 25 years old and approaching the end of their typical life cycle.

Despite this, the Department of Energy’s Loan Programs Office canceled a $4.9 billion loan guarantee in July to finance construction of the Grain Belt Express, a major transmission project more than a decade in the works and designed to channel power from wind and solar farms in the Great Plains to cities in more densely populated eastern states.

The termination came a week after Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican, told The New York Times that he had made a personal appeal to Trump to block the project.

“He said, ​‘Well, let’s just resolve this now,’” Hawley told the newspaper. ​“So he got Chris Wright on the line right there.”

Hawley’s hostility to the Grain Belt Express followed a playbook that has long been deployed by actors across the political spectrum to block transmission projects, amplifying not-in-my-backyard opponents’ anger over seizures of land through eminent domain. In this case, Missouri farmers balked at the transmission route running through their land without, in their view, providing enough direct benefits.

A similar dynamic tanked construction of the 700-mile-long transmission project that Clean Line Energy Partners wanted to build to connect wind farms in Oklahoma to energy users in Tennessee nearly a decade ago, as chronicled in journalist Russell Gold’s book, ​“Superpower: One Man’s Quest to Transform American Energy.” In Maine, meanwhile, environmental groups teamed up with fossil-fuel companies to pass a 2021 referendum banning construction of a power line connecting New England’s electricity-starved grid to Quebec’s almost-entirely carbon-free hydroelectric system.

The Trump administration has slashed far more than just the Grain Belt Express’ funding. Since taking office, Trump has yanked billions in Biden-era loans and grants for clean-energy projects and clawed back incentives for the sector in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. One of the few projects to receive steady funding under Trump’s Loan Programs Office has been nuclear developer Holtec International’s bid to restart the Palisades plant in Michigan, which aims to come back online before the end of the year.

The administration also in early October announced a list of billions of dollars more in clean-energy funding cuts targeted primarily at blue states — a list that included 26 grants from the DOE’s Grid Deployment Office, most of which are meant to expand the grid and boost its reliability.

Still, the latest transmission loan — along with the federal government’s AI Action Plan released in July — could signal that the administration is starting to acknowledge the importance of reinforcing the grid, said Thomas Hochman, director of the infrastructure and energy policy program at the right-leaning think tank Foundation for American Innovation.

“From the AI Action Plan to this latest loan, it’s great to see signs of this administration recognizing the centrality of the grid to AI and China competition,” he said.",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/GettyImages-2203463125.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=1d210e13449e5c0a7a4481bcbf0a73ba,N,,2025-10-16 12:11:41.945279

Congress created the Solar for All program in 2022 as part of the Inflation Reduction Act, directing EPA to make competitive grants to states and other entities to deploy solar projects in low-income and disadvantaged areas. EPA selected recipients and awarded all of the program funds to plaintiff states and other grant recipients by August 2024. Connecticut and the other plaintiffs moved forward with planning projects and working with stakeholders to develop their solar programs.

But EPA abruptly and unlawfully terminated the program two months ago and clawed back the vast majority of the money already awarded. That has left Connecticut and the other plaintiffs without access to the funds to proceed with their solar programs, after the states spent significant time planning and launching programs and committing state funds.

Connecticut was awarded and received $62.45 million in Solar for All funding in 2024 to increase access to solar and energy storage technologies for low-income and disadvantaged communities, including multifamily affordable housing. Working with the Connecticut Green Bank and the Connecticut Housing Finance Authority, the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection expected to assist 7,400 households through increased incentives, new loans and lease programs for residential solar and energy storage. The work would save $76.2 million for participating households.

On August 7, 2005, EPA liquidated the DEEP account that had contained the full remaining $62 million balance of the grant and suspended Connecticut’s access to the grant account. Later, with no explanation, the account balance was changed to $4.34 million. To date, EPA has yet to provide DEEP with any explanation regarding the changes to the grant.

“Donald Trump’s irrational fixation on renewable energy is costing all of us. Just like with Revolution Wind, Trump is trying to tank our opportunities to secure clean, affordable energy and keep us dependent on fossil fuels and foreign oil. Congress created the Solar for All program, and EPA awarded these funds so that Connecticut could help low-income residents save millions of dollars on their energy bills. Trump cannot unilaterally reverse course now, and we’re suing to make sure Connecticut gets every penny we are owed,” said Attorney General Tong.

“The Trump EPA’s attempt to cancel the Solar For All program reduces access to clean, affordable solar energy for thousands of Connecticut residents,” DEEP Commissioner Katie Dykes said. “Connecticut’s Solar for All program would help residents, particularly those in multi-family affordable housing, and communities, access the benefits of clean solar energy and the much-needed cost savings it can provide. This program would also help us improve our air quality, which is among the worst in the nation, and make our electric grid more resilient. EPA’s action runs completely counter to our efforts to bring affordable, clean, and reliable energy to Connecticut residents.”

When President Trump took office this past January, he prioritized fossil fuel extraction to address an alleged “energy emergency” while arbitrarily excluding solar power as a resource that can be tapped to meet the country’s energy needs. In July, Congress passed the president’s “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” rescinding funds for the Solar for All program that were unobligated as of July 3. The effect of that move was small, given that EPA had obligated all of the $7 billion for the program nearly a year earlier.

But instead of following that newly passed law, EPA and Zeldin illegally terminated the program on August 7. On social media, Zeldin made baseless accusations, calling Solar for All a “boondoggle.” The agency then sent memos to all recipients, including the plaintiffs, saying EPA no longer has a “statutory basis or dedicated funding” for the program, even though Congress never directed EPA to cancel funds that had already been awarded. In fact, Congress did the opposite by only rescinding unobligated funds for Solar for All.

Attorney General Tong and a multistate coalition are filing a lawsuit today in U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington, alleging, among other things, that the EPA violated the Administrative Procedure Act and the U.S. Constitution’s Separation of Powers Doctrine in unlawfully canceling the program.

The attorneys general of Arizona, Minnesota, and Washington are leading the complaint, which was joined by the attorneys general of California, Colorado, Connecticut, the District of Columbia, Hawaiʻi, Illinois, Massachusetts, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island, and Vermont. Also joining the complaint are the governors of Kentucky and Pennsylvania, as well as the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation.

Separately, Connecticut joined a lawsuit that was filed yesterday in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims. In that complaint, the states and other entities argue the EPA breached the clear terms of the agreements and violated the duty of good faith and fair dealing in canceling their Solar for All grants. They’re asking the court to award the plaintiffs money damages, interest, and fees.

The attorneys general of Maryland and Arizona are leading the complaint, which was also joined by the attorneys general in California, Colorado, Connecticut, Hawaiʻi, Illinois, Massachusetts, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, and the District of Columbia.

One of the unintended consequences of this consumer trend is the effect on gas tax revenue.

Every gasoline and diesel sale in the U.S. includes a small added tax. This tax is used to fund state transportation budgets, highway maintenance, and infrastructure projects. As a result of more EVs on the road, the amount of revenue generated by the gas tax is decreasing. This has created interesting financial repercussions, and a variety of solutions are being adopted to help.

Using state-by-state fuel tax data from the Department of Energy and consumer EV trends from the Alternative Fuels Data Center, CheapInsurance.com analyzed the economic impact of the changing transportation landscape and what’s being done to remedy the situation.

Nationwide EV adoption trends

Millions of Americans are choosing to purchase electric vehicles over traditional gas ones. The reasons include reduced charging costs compared to gas, lower emissions, and tax incentives.

The Bureau of Transportation Statistics reported that, in 2024, there were 1.2 million electric vehicle sales and 1.6 million hybrid electric vehicle sales. This is up from 238,000 EV sales and 455,000 hybrid-electric sales in 2020. This upward trend is likely to continue.

New EV registrations by state

The rate at which EVs are being bought and put on the road differs by state. This is mainly influenced by government policies, cultural attitudes, and economic factors.

For example, California has recently tried to enact an EV mandate that requires a certain percentage of new vehicle sales to be fully electric. This plan was then adopted by 11 other states. Although later blocked by the Senate, this prompted many consumers to transition to EVs.

Culturally, many Americans across the country do not want EVs, which explains lower purchase numbers in some states. The Pew Research Center found that, in May 2025, only 18% of Republicans and Republican-leaning individuals were at least somewhat interested in purchasing one. This is compared to Democrats, with 48% somewhat or very interested. This data was collected via a survey of Americans conducted from April 28 to May 4, 2025. This suggests that “red states” will have lower numbers of EV registrations than “blue states.”

The states with the highest EV registration numbers per 100,000 residents have the most significant loss in gas tax revenue. The number of EV vehicles on the road compared to gasoline vehicles is still quite low, so impacts are not being strongly felt yet. However, many states are predicting substantial losses in their gas tax revenue over the next decade.

In California, for example, the Mineta Transportation Institute predicts that there will be a 64% loss in revenue from 2025 to 2040. In this study, researchers considered eight different scenarios, each with a different rate of how many EVs are purchased, how many people in the state drive, and how many personal vehicles get registered. Results used 2024 inflation-adjusted numbers.

Budget impacts on state transportation departments

Millions of dollars in losses will have a severe impact on state highway and transportation departments if left unaddressed. According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, 2024 data pulled from the National Association of State Budget Officers states that gas tax revenue accounts for 35.9% of state transportation department revenue nationwide.

Without this revenue, several impacts will be felt:

Deficits in highway and road maintenance

Slower completion of infrastructure projects

Less development and expansion

Higher vehicle maintenance costs for the general population

How states are responding and planning for the future

States are recognizing that action needs to be taken to secure transportation budgets. Pew Research Center reports that many states are suffering from budget gaps and are having difficulty completing projects like bridge repairs.

To tackle the issue of reduced gas tax revenue, many states have begun taking measures and implementing programs that will generate revenue from electric vehicles instead.

EV registration fees

The most significant way that governmental bodies have buoyed transportation department revenue is with EV registration fees. These fees are charged at the initial time of registration and on an annual basis.

In Texas, for example, EV owners must pay $400 for the first-time registration and $200 each year, according to the Department of Energy.

Road usage charges

Other states are opting for a road usage fee. In Hawai‘i, EV owners are given the option to pay an annual, per-mile usage fee instead of a large registration fee. This is currently set at $0.08/mile, up to $50/year.

Oregon offers a similar program, called OReGO. California is also experimenting with its own pilot program.

What changes are needed on the road ahead?

It’s clear that policy change is needed to address the compounding loss in gas tax revenue as a result of widespread EV adoption. The amount of revenue that will need to be replaced is unclear, however, especially with an anticipated decline in EV demand due to the federal tax incentives ending.

Regardless, state agencies and the federal government will need to prioritize alternative methods for generating revenue. This could be through registration fees, road usage programs, or other revenue-generating systems that are put into place. It’s likely that the EV marketplace will continue to grow and that more households will begin replacing their gas vehicles, so prompt change is needed in the coming years.

The planned Cascade Advanced Energy Facility in Washington, which will be built by Energy Northwest with funding from Amazon, will deploy 12 small modular reactors, Amazon said in a Thursday release.

The “modular nature” of the plant means that three 320-MW sections will together comprise a 960-MW plant within the space of a few city blocks, in contrast to “traditional nuclear power facilities whose single GW plant can take up more than a square mile of land,” Amazon said.

The SMRs will be supplied by X-energy, which received $500 million in Series C funding from Amazon last year, using X-energy’s advanced nuclear reactor design. The Cascade facility will be built outside Richland, Washington, near Energy Northwest’s Columbia Generating Station.

X-energy’s “advanced reactor design, the Xe-100, will be used in Amazon’s partnership with Energy Northwest to develop four SMRs in the first phase of Cascade, with an initial capacity of 320 MW and the option to expand to 12 units with a capacity of 960 MW,” Amazon said in its release.

Construction is expected to start at the end of the decade, “with operations targeted to start in the 2030s,” Amazon said.

Energy Northwest, a consortium of 29 public utility districts and municipalities across Washington, said in 2024 that the deal with Amazon would meet an “urgent need to develop advanced technologies in the Pacific Northwest that provide reliable, carbon-free and sustainable energy generation.”

“The SMRs will be the Xe-100 design, a high-temperature gas-cooled reactor developed by X-energy ... Each Xe-100 module can provide 80 megawatts of full-time electricity,” Energy Northwest said.

Amazon’s Thursday release said the energy will help power AI and other digital tools.

X-energy and Amazon, along with Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power and Doosan Enerbility, also signed a strategic collaboration agreement in August to “accelerate the deployment of new Xe-100 advanced nuclear reactors in the United States to meet increasing power demands by data centers, advanced manufacturing, and electrification,” according to a release from X-energy.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/p7XAZXjpoxOtTWHqsNXTkdm6r1slpbXYZCR5n3Gtq_Q/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9jYWVmLTdfMS5wbmc=.webp,N,,2025-10-16 12:11:46.518215

The EPA’s report on a PFAS compound called Perfluorononanoic Acid (PFNA) concluded that PFNA can cause developmental, liver, and reproductive harm, including lower birth weights and reduced testosterone and sperm levels. According to ProPublica’s reporting, internal EPA documents and agency scientists confirmed that the report was “completed and ready to post” in April, needing only final briefings to leadership.

In a letter to EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, Pingree said the delay is part of a “growing pattern of interference with the Agency’s scientific work.”

“The delay in issuing the PFNA report coincided with EPA’s decision, in May of this year, to rescind some PFAS Safe Drinking Water Act regulations, one of which happens to be PFNA,” Pingree said. “This seems to be more than coincidence given that there has been strong industry pushback on regulating PFAS.”

“We both know that PFAS poses a significant public health threat to our water, food supply, and farming communities. It is necessary to take steps to combat PFAS contamination, yet this delay and erosion of capacity directly contradict your repeated public statements about both transparency and the need for strong, science-based PFAS policies,” she continued.

Pingree called on Zeldin to explain the delay—including who directed it—and asks when he will commit to releasing the PFNA assessment and ensuring future IRIS reports are free from political interference.

The letter is available here and copied below.

Background

Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are dangerous man-made “forever chemicals” that pose serious risks to public health and the environment, appearing at our former military installations, farms, and water systems. PFAS chemicals are persistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic. These chemicals have been linked to harmful human health effects, including cancer, reproductive and developmental harms, and weakened immune systems.

This is an urgent public health and environmental threat, and it’s growing at an alarming rate—in Maine, there have been more than 30,000 records of PFAS at close to 250 sites across the state.

Earlier this year, the EPA announced plans to rescind and reconsider limits on four “forever chemicals”—weakening landmark drinking water standards implemented under President Biden.

In July, Pingree and David Rouzer (R-N.C.) reintroduced the bipartisan Healthy Drinking Water Affordability Act, or the Healthy H2O Act, to help make water testing and treatment technology more accessible by providing grants for water testing and treatment technology directly to individuals and nonprofits in rural communities.

In both the Fiscal Year 2023 and Fiscal Year 2024 government funding bills, Pingree secured $8 million for the EPA to work to further research on PFAS contamination in agriculture, and EPA awarded $15 million in grant funding to ten institutions last September to research and reduce exposure to PFAS in agriculture.

+++

Dear Administrator Zeldin,

I write to you today regarding reports that your Agency is withholding a scientific assessment on Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) and a growing pattern of interference with the Agency’s scientific work, especially towards the Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS) program. A recent article states that the EPA is delaying the release of a report on a PFAS compound called Perfluorononanoic Acid (PFNA) that was due out in April of this year.

The delay in issuing the PFNA report coincided with EPA’s decision, in May of this year, to rescind some PFAS Safe Drinking Water Act regulations, one of which happens to be PFNA. This seems to be more than coincidence given that there has been strong industry pushback on regulating PFAS. The Trump Administration, Republicans in Congress, and industry have been hostile to the IRIS program which conducts these assessments. IRIS has consistently been a target with repeated attempts to weaken or dismantle its ability to perform independent scientific reviews of chemicals, like PFNA.

We both know that PFAS poses a significant public health threat to our water, food supply, and farming communities. It is necessary to take steps to combat PFAS contamination, yet this delay and erosion of capacity directly contradict your repeated public statements about both transparency and the need for strong, science-based PFAS policies. You recently announced the PFAS OUTreach Initiative to help protect communities and ensure water systems are in compliance with PFAS drinking water standards by providing resources, tools, and technical assistance. But by not releasing this report you are limiting the Agency’s ability to provide that assistance and ultimately protect communities from PFAS contamination.

I request clear answers to the following:

Why has the PFNA toxicity assessment not been released? Who directed its delay?

Have IRIS staff been reassigned or reduced under your leadership, if so, why?

When will you commit to releasing the PFNA assessment publicly and ensuring that future IRIS reports are published without political interference?

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter that concerns the health of millions of Americans.

The head of Imola Automotive USA — the startup that promised to create 45,000 electric vehicle jobs in struggling U.S. towns — acknowledged Tuesday that the company has been unable to secure land in two of the communities where it had proposed building manufacturing plants.

Still, he said, Imola hopes to break ground on a plant in Fort Valley, Georgia, within nine to 12 months.

During a press conference there on Tuesday, Imola CEO Rodney Henry said the company plans to build a 40-acre solar farm to help power the plant. Henry was joined by Fort Valley Mayor Jeffery Lundy, who said the project would include a 500,000-square-foot manufacturing plant along with retail development and housing for workers.

""We're here to create jobs,"" Henry told reporters. ""We're here to help the community.""

Said Lundy: ""Imola is coming to Fort Valley.""

Company representatives said Imola has received zoning approvals in Fort Valley but still needs to secure financing and obtain final design approval.

In January 2024, Imola announced plans to build six EV plants in the United States. But more than 18 months later, the company has yet to break ground on a single site, Floodlight reported in a story published in August.

Jay Taylor, an attorney representing Imola, acknowledged in a Friday letter to Floodlight that ""while the projects have most certainly experienced material delays, the plans and the commitment to see them to fruition remain in effect.""

In early 2024, Imola Automotive USA and the Tazzari Group — an Italian firm best known for its electric two-seater micro cars — jointly announced plans for a partnership.

The EVs that Tazzari makes in Italy aren't designed for highway driving. Top speed on the company's Opensky Sport model is about 56 miles per hour, while maximum speed on the Opensky Limited is about 37 mph, according to the company's website.

In response to a question from a reporter about the highway worthiness of the EVs, Henry responded the company plans to modify those cars so they can go up to 80 miles per hour.

Henry said Fort Valley is now the company's top priority. He was less definitive about the future of proposals to build Imola plants in Pine Bluff, Arkansas, and Langston, Oklahoma.

In Fort Valley, officials initially backed a plan for an EV facility expected to employ 7,500. But with no visible progress a year later, the company returned with a new pitch — a 99-year lighting contract. One council member called it a ""bait and switch.""

Pierre Turner, Imola's in-house counsel, said Tuesday that he has advised the company to drop the lighting project because ""it wouldn't be a good investment.""

Turner stressed that while Imola hopes to break ground on the EV factory in nine to 12 months, the company doesn't know how tariffs and the global economy will affect its plans so ""we're not promising.""

Officials in Pine Bluff last year pledged land and infrastructure for a plant that was supposed to bring 8,000 jobs. But a year later, former Mayor Shirley Washington told Floodlight: ""We never did get off the ground with that.""

Henry said on Tuesday that the town wasn't able to provide the land needed to build a plant there.

In Langston — where over a third of residents live in poverty — an Imola representative cited problems acquiring land. The company had asked the city to transfer vacant property and issue bonds. City council member Magnus Scott told Floodlight that the deal was canceled before anything moved forward.

Henry said the company never canceled its plans in Langston. Property that Imola had hoped to build on in Langston became ""unsecured,"" Henry acknowledged. ""So we didn't have property to continue the project.""

Scott could not be reached for comment on Tuesday.

Henry, who lives in Florida, has no prior experience in auto manufacturing. His background includes work as a television executive producer and the founder of an athletic footwear brand.

In July, he declined to speak with Floodlight, instead issuing a brief statement saying the company's timetable ""has been modified due to matters outside of our control,"" and that it remains ""highly focused on bringing our goals into alignment.""

Floodlight submitted detailed questions to Henry and Taylor on Friday, requesting, among other things, details on the status of each proposed EV plant. Taylor responded on Monday night, writing, ""Mr. Henry has agreed to provide responses at his earliest convenience.""

As of Tuesday evening, Henry had not responded.",https://scalawagmagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/250902_KAT_ImolaFortValleyPressConference_001-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-16 11:18:03.587062

Strategic investments in the US market The company’s commitment to the US market is evident in its substantial investments and strategic partnerships.
“It’s not insignificant—$12 billion is a big investment, and it really shows our commitment to being here in the U.S. and supporting this market,” Schnell emphasized.
“Their team even traveled to our Suwon plant in Korea to study operations and bring some best practices back to Georgia,” Schnell noted.
SK Battery America’s facility in Georgia spans 2.7 million square feet across two plants, with a production capacity of 22 gigawatt-hours per year.","At the Battery Show North America, Rob Schnell, President North America at SK On, presented “The New Battery Frontier: Growth, Innovation, and Opportunity in North America.” During his presentation, Schnell outlined SK On’s approach to addressing the evolving needs of the battery industry. He discussed the company’s investments, technological advancements, and efforts to support the growing demand for electric vehicles (EVs) and energy storage systems (ESS).

Strategic growth pillars

In his speech, Schnell outlined the company’s innovation strategy, highlighting its dedication to advancing the future of electrification through the following four strategic growth pillars:

1. Product innovation at the cell level: SK On is pushing the boundaries of battery technology by focusing on energy density, charge speed, and safety. Schnell highlights the company’s efforts to expand form factors, advance chemistries, and accelerate research and development (R&D).

SK On has also relied on partnerships. For example, the company partnered with L&F to establish a foundation for producing US-made lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries. Schnell emphasized, “We know the market will need more than just high nickel, and we will be there to supply it.”

Youngkee Shin (L), Head of Procurement at SK On, and Byunghee Lee, Chief Operating Officer of L&F, pose for a photo after signing a memorandum of understanding on the supply of LFP cathode materials at SK On’s Green Campus in Seoul on July 10. Courtesy of SK On..

Additionally, he said that the battery builder is exploring next-generation technologies such as cell-to-pack integration, dry coating, thermal propagation prevention, and solid-state batteries, aiming to reduce costs, improve safety, and scale production efficiently. He continued, “We launched a pilot facility in South Korea with our partner, Solid Power, to commercialize an all-solid-state battery by 2029 with a long-term target energy density of 1000 watt hours per liter (Wh/L).”

2. Factory innovation (Industry 4.0):

SK On is embracing Industry 4.0 principles by deploying advanced AI, automated equipment, and smart factory technologies. “We’re deploying advanced AI, significantly automated equipment, and smart factories to help us scale efficiently and reduce costs,” Schnell noted.

SK Battery America in Georgia, a 2.6 billion-dollar investment, exemplifies this approach. The facility produces 22 gigawatt-hours annually and employs over 3,000 people, leveraging cutting-edge automated equipment and strict quality control measures.

3. Expansion into new applications: The company is diversifying its business by expanding into energy storage systems (ESS) and other applications such as commercial vehicles, construction, and agriculture. “We already started in energy storage with our Flatiron partnership, and we’re continuing to explore different sectors within e-mobility,” Schnell said. According to him, the ESS market is growing rapidly, with US demand expected to exceed 100 gigawatts by 2030 from 40 gigawatts.

4. Value chain expansion: SK On is actively expanding its value chain by focusing on battery recycling, leveraging end-of-life battery technologies, and pursuing vertical integration. “We’re focusing on leveraging scrap and end-of-life batteries,” Schnell explained.

The company is also making strategic investments in energy sector businesses, such as its acquisition of SK Signet, a company specializing in EV charging technology. “We’re making strategic investments in other businesses within the energy sector,” Schnell said, emphasizing the importance of vertical integration in maintaining competitiveness.

Strategic investments in the US market

The company’s commitment to the US market is evident in its substantial investments and strategic partnerships. The company has contributed or committed approximately $12 billion in capital in the US, establishing a strong presence in key battery belt states such as Georgia and Kentucky. “It’s not insignificant—$12 billion is a big investment, and it really shows our commitment to being here in the U.S. and supporting this market,” Schnell emphasized.

Georgia serves as a critical hub for SK On’s operations in the US, offering logistical advantages, state partnerships, and access to top talent. Schnell explained, “Georgia is a global hub for EV manufacturing. It offers direct access to the interstate and rail corridors, proximity to the Savannah and Brunswick ports, and clean energy from the Vogtle nuclear power facility.”

The state’s Quick Start Program has been instrumental in hiring and training employees. “Their team even traveled to our Suwon plant in Korea to study operations and bring some best practices back to Georgia,” Schnell noted. Additionally, partnerships with institutions like Georgia Tech and the University of Georgia have helped build a pipeline of skilled technicians and engineers.

SK Battery America’s facility in Georgia spans 2.7 million square feet across two plants, with a production capacity of 22 gigawatt-hours per year. Schnell described the scale of the facility: “Each plant is nearly half a mile long, roughly the length of 10 football fields played end to end. It’s hard to put your head around unless you’ve been there.”

In Kentucky, SK On has partnered with Ford to develop the BlueOval site, further solidifying its presence in the US market. This joint venture aims to secure long-term supply for customers, localize high-value manufacturing, and create capacity to scale advanced chemistries and cell technologies. “We want to secure long-term supply for our customers and localize high-value manufacturing to reduce logistics and tariff exposure,” Schnell explained.

The Future and challenges of battery manufacturers

Schnell stated that despite slower-than-anticipated growth in EV adoption, the market is expanding steadily. By 2025, EVs are expected to account for 8-9% of new vehicle sales in the US, reaching 19-23% by 2030 and 35% by 2035, where he acknowledged, “EV adoption is growing slower than early forecasts suggested, but let’s not forget, it’s still growing.”

The future for battery manufacturers is marked by complexity, with challenges such as policy shifts, cost pressures, and fluctuating demand signals shaping the industry landscape. As he acknowledges, “This is a long journey, but we are prepared.” SK On is focused on strategic areas that ensure it remains competitive, adaptable, and well-positioned across diverse markets, not just mobility.",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/bltb299798942522069/bltac869ddb4670d4f3/68f10285ae6223c276af81a6/Schnell_SKOn.jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2025-10-16 11:15:36.351425

With geopolitical competition reshaping global energy flows, Africa’s role as a supplier of hydrocarbons, LNG and transition minerals has taken on new significance – positioning the continent as a critical arena for energy security, supply diversification and investment competition among major powers.

The United States: Driving Upstream Exploration and Infrastructure

At AEW, U.S. Senator Ted Cruz called for a revitalized American energy presence in Africa, emphasizing exploration, production and midstream infrastructure as the foundation for future engagement, reinforced by a dedicated U.S.-Africa Roundtable. U.S. companies such as ExxonMobil, Kosmos Energy and Chevron are expanding their exploration portfolios in West and East Africa – including deepwater projects in Namibia, Mozambique and Equatorial Guinea.

The U.S. approach reflects a broader strategy to diversify global energy supplies and counterbalance rival influences, particularly from China and Russia. Washington is leveraging private capital alongside technical partnerships, focusing on high-return exploration and LNG development opportunities under a pro-oil administration and a commercially driven diplomatic strategy.

Looking ahead to Invest in African Energy (IAE) 2026 in Paris – a key forum where African governments, investors and industry leaders converge to negotiate new projects and structure strategic partnerships – heightened American participation is expected. Delegations are likely to spotlight new acreage bids, innovative project financing models and joint venture opportunities with African national oil companies.

Russia: Expanding Energy Diplomacy through Technology Transfer

Russia, meanwhile, is advancing a more holistic African energy agenda. During a Russia-Africa Roundtable at AEW, Russian officials underscored partnerships with Equatorial Guinea and the Republic of the Congo, as well as ongoing collaboration through Rosatom, which is leading the country’s nuclear engagement on the continent. Rosatom is working with Rwanda to establish a nuclear science and technology center and has signed cooperation agreements with Mali and Guinea-Conakry.

Floating nuclear power units, small modular reactors and integrated gas infrastructure form the backbone of Russia’s energy offering. By pairing commercial energy solutions with technology transfer, Moscow aims to help African nations meet growing domestic demand while deepening political and trade ties. At IAE 2026 in Paris, Russia is expected to pursue further cooperation agreements in nuclear and gas-to-power development, reinforcing the country’s ambition to secure a lasting role across Africa’s energy value chain.

The UAE: Deploying Sovereign Capital for Scale and Integration

The United Arab Emirates is taking a long-term approach to Africa’s energy and infrastructure development. Emirati sovereign wealth funds, development agencies and energy majors are expanding their footprint across oil and gas, solar, hydrogen and integrated energy logistics. At AEW, Sharif Al Olama, Under-Secretary for Energy and Petroleum Affairs at the Ministry of Energy and Infrastructure, invited African nations and energy companies to join the Global Energy Efficiency Alliance, an initiative launched by the UAE to double energy efficiency rates and accelerate the transition to clean energy. Through companies such as ADNOC, Masdar and AMEA Power, the UAE is financing large-scale solar and hydrogen projects across North and West Africa.

More broadly, the UAE has emerged as Africa’s largest external investor, channeling significant capital into clean energy, industrial infrastructure and energy transition initiatives. In Paris, UAE companies are expected to present integrated energy solutions spanning upstream production, renewables, offtake and transmission – underpinned by sovereign capital and long-term regional partnerships.",https://ecpbucket.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/16163130/IAE-2026-LOGO.jpg,N,,2025-10-16 11:14:09.475823

While most automakers saw higher BEV sales during the rush, some brands – including BMW, Nissan, and Toyota – recorded declines.","There’s a new record for electrified vehicles that likely won’t be broken anytime soon – and no, it’s not about China’s Yangwang U9 Xtreme becoming the fastest car in the world last month. Something else happened in the world of electrification in September, and while it may not be as thrilling, it’s still a major milestone.

According to the UK-based research firm Rho Motion, which specializes in EV-related data, global sales of electrified light vehicles – including battery-electric vehicles (BEV) and plug-in hybrids (PHEV) – set a new monthly record in September, surpassing 2.1 million units. That figure represents a 26% increase compared to the same month last year.

China Leads The Charge

Unsurprisingly, China continues to dominate the global EV market by a significant margin. The country accounted for the majority of global sales, with more than 1.3 million electrified vehicles sold in September alone. Of those, just over 800,000 units were BEVs – an impressive 28% increase year-on-year and a new record for China. PHEV sales, however, dipped slightly to just under 500,000 units, marking a 2% decline. Despite that, China’s performance remains unmatched. Over the first nine months of 2025, Chinese consumers purchased nearly nine million electrified vehicles, representing a 24% rise compared to the same period in 2024.

Europe ranked as the second-largest market for electrified vehicles. According to Rho Motion’s data, European consumers bought approximately 427,000 electrified vehicles in September – a 36% year-on-year increase. Demand continues to strengthen thanks to various incentive programs rolling out across key countries such as the UK and Germany. Unlike China, Europe’s growth leans more heavily toward PHEVs. In the UK, for instance, BEV sales in September rose 30%, while PHEV sales surged nearly 60% compared to the previous year. This trend suggests that many European buyers still value the flexibility of hybrid technology as charging infrastructure expands.

Across the Atlantic, the US also posted record figures. Electrified vehicle sales jumped 66% year-on-year in September, reaching about 215,000 units. It marked the second straight month of growth and capped off a record-breaking third quarter. According to Cox Automotive, US BEV sales totaled 438,487 units in the third quarter – up 20% from the same period in 2024, which had previously been the record high. BEVs made up roughly 10.5% of total US vehicle sales during the quarter, underscoring their growing footprint in the market. However, this record demand may prove short-lived.

A Slowdown Looms In The US

Analysts attribute the surge in US BEV sales not to a fundamental market shift but to buyers rushing to purchase vehicles before federal tax credits expired on September 30. While most automakers saw higher BEV sales during the rush, some brands – including BMW, Nissan, and Toyota – recorded declines.

With the federal incentives now gone and states such as California backing out of offering alternative programs, industry experts expect BEV demand in the US to drop sharply in the fourth quarter. In anticipation, automakers like General Motors, Mercedes-Benz, and Volkswagen have already scaled back production. Others – including GM, Hyundai, and even Maserati – have introduced discounts and promotional offers to help offset the loss of federal tax credits and maintain sales momentum.",https://static0.carbuzzimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/cropped-p90422144_highres_v2.jpg?w=1600&h=900&fit=crop,N,,2025-10-16 13:03:44.779805

Flanked by flannel-clad supporters holding “Live free or die” signs, then-candidate Donald Trump wished the crowd a Merry Christmas before launching into what he saw as the biggest faults of the current administration. He swung at President Biden himself (“crooked Joe”) and the state of the economy (“Bidenomics”). About 10 minutes in, he arrived at Biden’s climate policies, which he said were “wasting trillions of dollars on Green New Deal nonsense.”

But Trump wasn’t satisfied with his choice of insult, perhaps recognizing that echoing “Green New Deal” served to amplify his opponents’ pro-climate action rallying cry. So in front of the crowd, he began riffing on ways to undermine it in real time.

“They don’t know what they’re doing, but you’re going to be in the poorhouse to fund his big government Green New Deal, which is a socialist scam. And you know what? You have to be careful. It’s going to put us all in big trouble,” he said. “The Green New Deal that doesn’t work. It’s a Green New Scam. Let’s call it, from now on, the ‘Green New Scam.'”

The crowd roared, shaking their signs in approval. “I do like that term, and I just came up with that one,” Trump said. “The Green New Scam. It will forever be known as the Green New Scam.”

There’s been plenty of attention on Trump’s purge of climate change language, and for good reason: Government workers are tiptoeing around vocabulary they once used freely. “Clean energy,” “climate science,” and “pollution” are on the list of “woke” words federal agencies have told employees to avoid. Recently, a memo circulated at the Department of Energy’s renewable energy office advised employees to remove or rephrase basic terms including “climate change,” “emissions,” and “green.” But the administration is doing more than making these phrases disappear. It’s also introducing new language designed to undermine the foundations upon which trust in climate science and policy is built.

In the nine months since Trump began his second presidency, the phrase “Green New Scam” — always capitalized — has appeared in White House fact sheets and press statements, echoed across federal agencies and by Republicans in Congress.

“He’s quite effective at creating sticky phrases and using repetition to amplify them,” said Renee Hobbs, a communications professor at the University of Rhode Island who wrote a book on modern propaganda. “That’s the classic propaganda strategy, right? You repeat the phrases that you want to stick, and you downplay, ignore, minimize, or censor the concepts that don’t meet your agenda.”

It’s part of a broader effort to erase information about how the planet is changing. In recent months, the administration has axed entire pages about climate change and how to adapt to it, said Gretchen Gehrke, who monitors federal websites with the Environmental Data and Governance Initiative. The 400 experts working on the government’s next official climate report were dismissed, then all the past reports vanished, too. The administration has proposed stopping long-running projects that monitor carbon dioxide levels, and the Environmental Protection Agency is no longer collecting greenhouse gas emissions data from polluting companies.

You could see it as a three-pronged strategy. First, erase language related to climate change. Second, dismantle the scientific foundation supporting it. Third, fill the void with a message that matches Trump’s political priorities — like the “Green New Scam.”

“We’ve always understood language shapes reality, and language can create unreal realities,” Hobbs said. “And I think that’s what Trump is doing with his language of climate change.”

In Trump’s growing arsenal of anti-climate catchphrases, “Green New Scam” remains a go-to weapon. The Green New Deal concept was a ripe target for Trump because it serves as a catch-all for progressive positions, said Josh Freed, senior vice president for climate and energy at the think tank Third Way. “That was the target that I think Trump honed in on and flipped the script on, and turned it into a vulnerability and catchphrase for what he felt the public would see as positions that were extreme,” he said.

Trump has taken the idea to an international audience. In his speech to the United Nations General Assembly last month, he spent a full 10 minutes ranting off-script about climate policy, deriding renewables and international efforts to address climate change. “If you don’t get away from this green scam, your country is going to fail,” he told the world leaders in attendance.

In the same speech, he went on to call climate change “the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world.” He also claimed that “the carbon footprint is a hoax made up by people with evil intentions.”

Conspiracy theories are a common tool in propaganda, according to Hobbs. “Conspiracy theories are catnip because they postulate this malevolent actor who’s doing something secretly to hurt people, and humans are hardwired to pay attention to stuff like that,” she said. Studies have shown that fake news about climate change is more compelling to people than scientific facts.

Still, Trump is fighting an uphill battle trying to paint climate change as fake. About 70 percent of Americans acknowledge that global warming is happening. Meanwhile, recent polling found that most Americans don’t trust Republicans on the environment, with only 23 percent preferring the party’s plan for tackling environmental issues.

But if a phrase gets repeated often enough, it can begin to bend reality, even if it’s inaccurate. It’s a rule that Trump intuitively understands, and a driving force behind his linguistic prescriptions. “I have a little standing order in the White House — never use the word ‘coal,’ only use the words ‘clean, beautiful coal,’” Trump said in his speech to the U.N. “Sounds much better, doesn’t it?”

Coal may be dirty by basically every yardstick people use to decide whether something is clean, but the phrase “clean coal” could still change people’s associations with the fuel. “If you can control vocabulary, you’re controlling thought,” said Kathleen Hall Jamieson, a professor of communication at the University of Pennsylvania who has spent decades studying campaign messaging. Once we adopt a new set of terms, those words start doing the thinking for us, she said. People absorb the assumptions that are baked into them, often without even noticing.

Jamieson says it’s part of a broader strategy to boost fossil fuels over renewable energy sources like solar and wind. The Trump administration has canceled billions of funding in clean energy projects while simultaneously fast-tracking permits for new pipelines and other fossil fuel infrastructure. Last month, the Energy Department announced it would pour $625 million into rescuing the coal industry, which has been dying as natural gas and renewables have taken off.

“The administration is trying to align the vocabulary through which we talk about the environment with policies that are consistent with increased drilling,” Jamieson said. “You don’t have to do much work to see the relationship between the policies and the language.”

As for how to respond to propaganda, Hobbs said that turning to facts — like scientists and journalists often do — is not the most effective strategy. Research has long shown that feelings are more important than facts in changing people’s minds. “You fight propaganda with propaganda, right?” she said. Climate advocates are increasingly connecting climate change to inflation and the rising cost of living, in an effort to reach Americans struggling with high electricity bills.

On the micro level, Hobbs said she’s seen success in online experiments where people engaged in genuine, open conversations about different propaganda topics, from free speech rights to the role of social media influencers. The format prompted people to talk about conspiracy theories they’ve encountered, what feelings those stories evoked, and which ones were harmful. Participants were encouraged to open up about their uncertainties and where they were coming from — and in doing so, they often came to their own realization that their beliefs might be influenced by propaganda. Hobbs said that people decreased their fear of others who thought differently and became more critical about the information they were receiving.

“We can’t help but be exposed to propaganda,” Hobbs said, “but how we react to it is up to us.”",https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Trump-microphones.jpg?quality=75&strip=all,N,,2025-10-16 13:04:05.685183

That has left Washington and the other plaintiffs without access to the funds to proceed with their solar programs.
In Washington, for example, EPA’s illegal move jeopardizes $156 million for qualifying solar projects in the state.","Washington and 22 other plaintiffs are suing the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin for illegally ending a $7 billion program that lowers energy costs and pollution by bringing solar energy to more than 900,000 households in low-income and disadvantaged communities across the country.

Washington and 23 other grant recipients also filed suit yesterday in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims to recover damages for EPA’s unlawful breach of the grant agreements that were executed under this program.

Congress created the Solar for All program in 2022 as part of the Inflation Reduction Act, directing EPA to make competitive grants to states and other entities to deploy solar projects in low-income and disadvantaged areas. EPA selected recipients and awarded all of the program funds to plaintiff states and other grant recipients by August 2024. Washington and the other plaintiffs moved forward with planning projects and working with stakeholders to develop their solar programs.

But EPA abruptly and unlawfully terminated the program two months ago and clawed back the vast majority of the money already awarded. That has left Washington and the other plaintiffs without access to the funds to proceed with their solar programs. In Washington, for example, EPA’s illegal move jeopardizes $156 million for qualifying solar projects in the state. The Washington State Department of Commerce invested more than 5,000 employee hours in developing Solar for All programming and was hoping to launch its programming in late 2025 or early 2026. Now, the Department of Commerce has no path forward.

“The administration is again targeting people struggling to get by in America, this time by gutting programs that help low-income households afford electricity,” Washington State Attorney General Nick Brown said. “Congress passed a solar energy program to help make electricity costs more affordable, but the administration is ignoring the law and focused on the conspiracy theory that climate change is a hoax.”

When President Trump took office this past January, he prioritized fossil fuel extraction to address an alleged “energy emergency” while arbitrarily excluding solar power as a resource that can be tapped to meet the country’s energy needs. In July, Congress passed the president’s “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” rescinding funds for the Solar for All program that were unobligated as of July 3. The effect of that move was small, given that EPA had obligated all of the $7 billion for the program nearly a year earlier.

But instead of following that newly passed law, EPA and Zeldin illegally terminated the program on August 7. On social media, Zeldin made baseless accusations, calling Solar for All a “boondoggle.” The agency then sent memos to all recipients, including the plaintiffs, saying EPA no longer has a “statutory basis or dedicated funding” for the program, even though Congress never directed EPA to cancel funds that had already been awarded. In fact, Congress did the opposite by only rescinding unobligated funds for Solar for All.

Washington and a multistate coalition are filing a lawsuit today in U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington, alleging, among other things, that the EPA violated the Administrative Procedure Act and the U.S. Constitution’s Separation of Powers Doctrine in unlawfully canceling the program.

Brown and the attorneys general of Arizona and Minnesota are leading the complaint, which was joined by the attorneys general of California, Colorado, Connecticut, the District of Columbia, Hawaiʻi, Illinois, Massachusetts, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island, and Vermont. Also joining the complaint are the governors of Kentucky and Pennsylvania, as well as the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation.

Separately, Washington joined a lawsuit that was filed yesterday in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims. In that complaint, the states and other entities argue the EPA breached the clear terms of the agreements and violated the duty of good faith and fair dealing in canceling their Solar for All grants. They’re asking the court to award the plaintiffs money damages, interest, and fees.

The attorneys general of Maryland and Arizona are leading the complaint, which was also joined by the attorneys general in California, Colorado, Connecticut, Hawaiʻi, Illinois, Massachusetts, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, and the District of Columbia.

CHICAGO, IL / ACCESS Newswire / October 16, 2025 / Authored by Baker Tilly's Gideon Gradman, Michelle Isenhouer Hanlin, Shristhi Negi, Valerie Nubbe

Explore how the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) reshapes IRA tax credit access and accelerates the timeline for action for your campus.

As higher education institutions across the country continue to grapple with aging infrastructure and sustainability commitments, the energy incentives in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA) have been a vital tool in making clean energy projects financially feasible. By reducing upfront costs for solar, battery storage, central utility plants and other clean energy technologies, the IRA has helped institutions improve infrastructure resiliency and advance sustainability goals while preserving capital. The IRA made sure these benefits were accessible to tax-exempt institutions through the direct pay provision of the law, allowing not-for-profits to receive the Investment Tax Credits and/or Production Tax Credits (ITC/PTC) as a refundable cash payment not previously available to tax-exempt organizations, a game changer for higher education.

What is the One Big Beautiful Bill Act?

On July 4, 2025, President Trump signed the sweeping tax reform and spending reconciliation bill known as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) into law. While the legislation addresses a broad range of issues, it notably revises several energy tax incentives introduced under the IRA. As one of the most consequential amendments to the IRA, future credit claimants have been busy trying to understand how these statutory changes interact with existing guidance.

The OBBBA preserves the direct pay option, ensuring that colleges and universities can still access clean energy incentives directly. However, it also accelerates the phase-out of certain tax credit funding provisions for clean energy power generation projects, narrowing the window for higher education institutions to benefit. Institutions can still take advantage of funding opportunities for projects like solar energy and geothermal energy installations, but timing is critical. Those institutions with projects underway should move quickly, while others may need to identify new clean energy projects this year if they want to utilize their benefits.

Furthermore, the legislation narrows access to certain benefits by imposing more restrictive rules on involvement with foreign entities of concern, setting new qualification deadlines and gradually phasing out select provisions. Many clean energy incentives remain in place, but with more limited windows of opportunity and stricter compliance standards. As a result, the urgency for educational institutions to start is great than ever.

How does the OBBBA affect higher education energy projects?

Solar

The Commercial Solar ITC under IRC Section 48E imposes a tighter construction window: schools must break ground by July 4, 2026, or bring systems online by Dec. 31, 2027, to secure funding. Fortunately, opportunities remain, but you need to get started to secure the solar tax credit funding.

Energy storage

A bright spot for institutions is in energy storage, an area that remains favorably treated under the OBBBA. The full ITC is still available for standalone battery storage systems through 2033, giving institutions ample time to plan campus-scale installations with robust federal backing. Even as solar incentives phase out, pairing energy storage with leased or safe-harbored solar systems may help offset cost impacts and sustain long-term sustainability goals.

Fuel cells and linear generators

Fuel cells, including linear generators offer a compelling opportunity under OBBBA as the incentives are built to last. Eligible fuel cell and linear generator systems that generate electricity now qualify for a base 30% ITC, offering a new option for distributed generation on campus with heat recovery where needed. Unlike solar and wind technologies facing early sunsets, fuel cells and linear generator projects remain federally supported if projects begin construction after Dec. 31, 2025, through the end of 2035.

Electric vehicles (EVs) and EV chargers

Colleges and universities considering alternative fuel vehicles to add to their fleet must move swiftly. Federal credits including the Commercial Clean Vehicle Credit (45W) and EV incentives (30D and 25E) expire after Sept. 30, 2025, while refueling infrastructure support under Section 30c ends by June 30, 2026.

Incentives in action: Our work on campuses

Baker Tilly has worked with numerous colleges and universities over the past few years, helping them take advantage of clean energy incentives for campus projects. Our energy and infrastructure team has helped these institutions understand their eligibility for clean energy tax credit funding and comply with myriad requirements needed to earn and keep these credits. This includes compliance with the prevailing wage and apprenticeship bonus credits (PW&A) requirements, domestic content bonus credit requirements and energy community bonus credit compliance requirements. Baker Tilly also helps guide institutions through the direct pay election process, allowing them to monetize tax credits as tax-exempt organizations. Our team also performs energy feasibility studies and cost segregation analyses to determine eligible property costs and optimize credit values. For example:

Baker Tilly is engaged with a major private university in the Northeast to secure federal clean energy tax credits for over $1 billion in energy initiatives, including geothermal and solar projects. Their planned solar installation generates approximately 1.9 megawatt-hours annually, covering around 17% of a key campus building's energy needs. Their campus-wide geothermal heating and cooling project will deliver ground-source thermal energy to meet more than half of the heating and cooling requirements for current and future buildings for a portion of the campus. These efforts support the university's sustainability and climate goals while enhancing energy infrastructure and reducing emissions by over 15%.

Baker Tilly is helping a private college in the Midwest to secure federal clean energy tax credits for a roughly $7 million thermal energy storage initiative. The project involves installing a thermal storage tank to shift electricity usage from daytime to nighttime, which helps reduce costs and lower demand charges by balancing energy consumption. Baker Tilly is supporting the college through the pre-construction phase by evaluating eligibility and ensuring compliance with tax credit requirements. The team will continue assisting through commissioning to help maximize and substantiate the credit, including adherence to PW&A standards for final tax filings.

Act now! What should your institution do next?

Assess your energy project pipeline

Identify capital projects that could qualify for OBBBA-related credits, grants or financing mechanisms

Update your facilities and finance teams on funding opportunities

Ensure that key internal teams are informed about the OBBBA provisions and prepared to act quickly as funding opportunities and compliance requirements emerge

“We are delighted to welcome Electrolux and the additional jobs and investment it brings to Lenoir County,” said Senator Bob Brinson.","Today Governor Josh Stein announced household appliance company Electrolux Consumer Products, Inc., will add 74 new jobs in Lenoir County. The company will invest more than $23.7 million to expand its Kinston dishwasher production facility and Manufacturing Center of Excellence for dish production in North America.

“I am pleased that Electrolux chose to expand its operation in eastern North Carolina – the second job announcement for Lenoir County this week,” said Governor Josh Stein. “Our state is a great place to do business thanks to our highly skilled manufacturing workforce and the business-friendly climate we have cultivated. I look forward to watching the company continue to grow and thrive in Kinston.”

Electrolux is a globally recognized appliance company that has produced household products for more than 100 years. The Kinston location opened in 1989, manufacturing plastic tub dishwashers for the company’s North American market. This expansion will add 30,000 square feet to its existing footprint to manufacture stainless steel tub dishwashers in the United States.

“This expansion is a testament to our commitment to U.S. manufacturing and our belief in the strength of the Kinston workforce,” said Ricardo Cons, president and CEO of Business Area North America for Electrolux Group. “We’re proud to continue investing in a community that has supported us for more than three decades, and to do so in North Carolina - a state with a pro-business climate that prioritizes and champions manufacturing.”

“Companies already operating in our state are some of the best recruiters,” said Commerce Secretary Lee Lilley. “When innovative manufacturers like Electrolux reinvest in North Carolina, it’s a powerful signal that our state is indeed the best place to do business in America because we are home to the largest manufacturing workforce in the Southeast, strong manufacturing partnerships, and a robust transportation system to help them get products to market faster.”

While wages for assemblers, handlers, machine operators, technicians, and engineers vary, the annual average salary for the new positions will be $48,807, which exceeds the Lenoir County average of $48,683. These new jobs could potentially create an annual payroll impact of more than $3.6 million for the region.

A performance-based grant of $200,000 from the One North Carolina Fund will help the company’s expansion in North Carolina. The OneNC Fund provides financial assistance to local governments to help attract economic investment and to create jobs. Companies receive no money upfront and must meet job creation and capital investment targets to qualify for payment. All OneNC grants require matching participation from local governments, and any award is contingent upon that condition being met.

“We are delighted to welcome Electrolux and the additional jobs and investment it brings to Lenoir County,” said Senator Bob Brinson. “Eastern North Carolina has always provided growing companies with a great business environment, an excellent quality of life, a diligent labor pool, and a partnership as a member of our community.”

“This is outstanding news for Kinston, Lenoir County, and the entire state,” said Representative Chris Humphrey. “Electrolux has been a phenomenal corporate citizen for more than three decades, and we’re grateful to the economic development professionals as well as the state and local officials who helped them make their decision to expand here.”

In addition to the North Carolina Department of Commerce and the Economic Development Partnership of North Carolina, other key partners in this project include the North Carolina General Assembly, North Carolina Community College System, Lenoir Community College, North Carolina’s Southeast, North Carolina Global TransPark Economic Development Region, Lenoir County, and Lenoir County Development Alliance.",,N,,2025-10-16 11:16:05.062488

The John Locke Foundation has proposed a working group to examine the guest worker visa program and identify areas for improvement.

H2A workers place a significant burden on small to mid-sized farmers, who must shoulder the costs of housing and transporting guest workers, in addition to paying their wages, according to “Harvest on Hold,” a report out earlier this year by Kelly Lester, policy analyst for the John Locke Foundation.

“As the availability of farm labor has declined, wages have increased in response to the dynamics of supply and demand, while some argue this is a natural market correction, others point out that wage increases in agriculture often do not translate to long-term solutions,” said the report. “Many small and mid-sized farms operate on tight margins and cannot easily absorb high labor costs without raising prices or reducing their workforce.”

The proposed working group would consist of 13 members, including representatives from the US Department of Agriculture, Department of Commerce, and Department of Labor; representatives from the Farm Bureau and Growers Association; state lawmakers and owners of small to mid-sized farms; labor contractors, academics, and nonprofit reps serving immigrant and seasonal workers.

“The H-2A visa program is critical to North Carolina agriculture, but it’s overly complicated, expensive, and slow to adapt to modern farm realities,” Lester, who authored the proposal, told the Carolina Journal. “Right now, farmers face layers of bureaucracy that drive up costs and make it harder to bring in workers when they’re actually needed. While the federal government has started discussing some reforms to the program, it is vital for North Carolina to have a voice. By creating a working group focused on real-world reforms — like streamlining applications, cutting compliance delays, and making the program more flexible for year-round operations — we can help farmers lower their input costs in a time when it is desperately expensive to operate a farm.”

The purpose of the working group would be to examine how the program currently operates within North Carolina, identify areas for improvement, and determine the best practices being implemented in neighboring states. Based on these examinations, the group would develop recommendations for policymakers at the federal level, including streamlining the application process, adjusting housing and wage requirements, and increasing flexibility for farms that need laborers on a year-round basis.",https://www.carolinajournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/47075383914_5292d4a061_k.jpg,N,,2025-10-16 13:04:59.833543

Summary

Between January and September 2025, companies announced over $1.2 trillion in investments towards building out U.S. production capacity – led by electronics, pharmaceuticals, and semiconductors.

The increase in planned U.S. production investments could lead to another period of accelerated construction manufacturing spending.

Building out U.S. manufacturing capacity across industries will likely create significant opportunities for U.S. infrastructure developers, as the construction and operation of large-scale manufacturing facilities requires significant materials, labor, and power.

The United States is experiencing a manufacturing resurgence, facilitated by a changing federal policy landscape and a shift to companies prioritizing supply chain resilience. Over the first eight months of the second Trump Administration, companies announced over $1.2

Stephanie Valdez Streaty, Cox director of industry insights, said in a report EVs could account for one quarter of all new U.S. car sales by 2030.
The company captured 15% of EV sales in the quarter, led by its new Chevrolet Equinox, the third best-selling battery-powered machine.
In the current quarter, S&P Global expects EVs to comprise less than 7% of new car sales.
BloombergNEF expects at least nine new electric cars and trucks priced below $40,000 in the next three years.","Americans bought 438,500 electric cars and trucks in the third quarter, as drivers raced to grab federal incentives before they expired Sept. 30.

Those transactions, the highest number in a single quarter, comprised 11% of all new car sales, eclipsing the previous high point of 8.7%, according to Cox Automotive, a services and technology company.

A crowd of more affordable cars next year could help maintain the momentum, but analysts expect EV transactions to dip in the months ahead without federal tax credits.

Stephanie Valdez Streaty, Cox director of industry insights, said in a report EVs could account for one quarter of all new U.S. car sales by 2030. That’s “well short of the 50% once envisioned, but certainly moving out of the ‘niche’ category.”

The sales tally underscores a tricky dynamic for auto executives and clean-air advocates: Millions of Americans want electric vehicles, but relatively high prices remain a speed bump to adoption.

Tesla Inc. still dominates the U.S. market for EVs and managed a small sales gain in the recent quarter after months of skidding results. However, a crowd of rivals is closing the gap quickly, shrinking Tesla’s share of the EV pie to 41% from 80% four years ago.

General Motors Co., in particular, is gaining electric speed. The company captured 15% of EV sales in the quarter, led by its new Chevrolet Equinox, the third best-selling battery-powered machine. That’s up from 10% in the year-earlier period.

Nearly half of U.S. EV purchases in the first half of the year were made without any federal incentive, according to BloombergNEF. And there are now at least 11 EVs in the United States with starting prices below that of the average car purchase. Chevrolet’s Equinox can be had for about $35,000, for example, and the brand just released a new version of its Bolt with a price tag of $29,000.

Emily Almaer, a mother of three in Boulder, Colo, is paying $250 a month for the Volkswagen ID.4 she picked up in August. At least three of her friends also recently ponied up for EVs: another Volkswagen, a Nissan Leaf and a Hyundai Ioniq 9.

“You look at some of these (monthly payments),” her husband, Dion Almaer, said, “and it’s like ‘Wait, this is like one family meal out.’”

The road ahead for EVs, however, looks rocky, at least for a little while. Without federal credits, BloombergNEF forecasts 27% of the U.S. market will be electric by 2030, down from the 48% share it estimated a year ago. In the current quarter, S&P Global expects EVs to comprise less than 7% of new car sales.

“The affordability issue is going to be exacerbated,” said Peter Nagle, an associate director at S&P. “It’s really going to be a sink or swim moment.”

Meanwhile, the market for used EVs is booming and more affordable EV models are heading to production. BloombergNEF expects at least nine new electric cars and trucks priced below $40,000 in the next three years.

Volvo Car AB Chief Executive Officer and President Hakan Samuelsson said his company will take a “huge step” next year in offering EVs with longer driving ranges and lower prices.

“The industry will be electric — there’s no turning back,” he told Bloomberg recently. “It may take a bit longer in some regions, but the direction is clear.”","https://www.detroitnews.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/10/16/PDTN/86723815007-uscarsbg-y-5-tmpp-7-thzaktcp-3-lht-7-laxici.jpg?crop=3995,2249,x0,y204&width=3200&height=1802&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-10-16 11:15:40.869042

Backed by $150 million through the Site Investment and Infrastructure Fund created by Act 365 in the 2025 Regular Legislative Session, FastSites catalyzes local and regional partners to expand Louisiana’s inventory of development-ready assets that allow businesses to mitigate time, risk and money.

“This is one of the most forward-thinking site development models in the country,” said LED Chief Economic Competitiveness Officer Ileana Ledet. “FastSites aligns government efficiency with private-sector speed, ensuring Louisiana can meet the demands of global investment while strengthening our communities and infrastructure.”

FastSites is built around a new model of velocity and accountability. Projects must demonstrate measurable returns, leverage private capital, and begin construction activities within nine months. Funding can be structured as forgivable loans, performance-based partnerships, or infrastructure investments, allowing the state to adapt to each project’s strategic potential.

Through targeted investment in infrastructure such as roads, utilities, and rail, FastSites transforms land into high-performance economic platforms, ready for immediate investment and scalable growth.

The application period for the inaugural round of funding opens October 30 and closes December 15. FastSites is open to public entities such as economic development organizations, municipalities, redevelopment authorities and political subdivisions. Privately owned sites may also qualify if they meet additional requirements designed to promote strong local investment and sustained growth.

To help potential applicants learn more about the program and application process, LED will host a webinar on Monday, October 27, at 2:00 p.m. Registration is available in advance here. After registering, attendees will receive a confirmation email with details about joining the meeting.

To support the integration of these vehicles, DHL has also installed on-site charging infrastructure at its facilities in these markets, enabling drivers to conveniently recharge the vans between routes.

This signifies the first U.S. expansion of the global partnership, with more than 10,000 eSprinters now integrated into DHL’s fleet.

All vehicles are expected to be delivered by the end of October 2025, and will be deployed across key metropolitan markets, including Chicago, IL; Indianapolis, IN; Pittsburgh, PA; Elizabeth, NJ; and Moonachie, NJ.

While the new eSprinters promise a 206-mile range, DHL has consistently seen them exceed 240 miles—making them the longest-range battery electric vehicles in DHL’s U.S. fleet to-date. This extended capacity makes them ideally suited for inner city logistics while expanding their potential use in longer delivery routes. The vans also offer significant cargo capacity, enabling efficient last-mile delivery without compromise on payload or operational reliability.

To support the integration of these vehicles, DHL has also installed on-site charging infrastructure at its facilities in these markets, enabling drivers to conveniently recharge the vans between routes. The addition of this infrastructure ensures operational efficiency, maximizes vehicle uptime, and provides the foundation for future fleet electrification as the company scales its use of electric vehicles in the U.S.

For many of our reshoring manufacturers, especially those racing to meet incentive deadlines or counter competitors, it’s a trade worth making.
In an era when speed and flexibility rival cost of capital in importance, private credit may well become the financial engine behind America’s manufacturing resurgence.","Key Takeaways

Private credit is emerging as a key reshoring enabler, offering manufacturers faster and more flexible access to capital than traditional syndicated loans—critical for meeting government incentive deadlines and outpacing competitors.

Flexibility and customization are major advantages, as private lenders can tailor repayment structures, drawdowns, and equity participation to match the long timelines and capital intensity of reshoring projects.

The trade-off comes with higher costs and tighter oversight, but for manufacturers prioritizing speed, adaptability, and strategic execution, private credit often justifies the premium as a catalyst for U.S. manufacturing growth.

The push to return manufacturing to U.S. shores, driven by fragile supply chains, shifting geopolitics, and ambitious domestic industrial policy, has shifted from boardroom talk to a surge of reshoring projects. From precision components to semiconductors, plants are breaking ground at a pace not seen in decades. But amid the strategy lies a pressing question: how to finance construction, workforce development, and other reshoring operations quickly and flexibly enough to seize the moment.

While syndicated loans remain a staple for large-scale borrowers, private creditis emerging as a decisive enabler for reshoring. Once a niche alternative, it has grown into an over $1.5 trillion global market with clear benefits for manufacturers of all sizes seeking financing options that align with the particular financing needs of reshoring.

Why Private Credit Fits the Reshoring Agenda

Speed and certainty are the most immediate advantages. Manufacturing development is often tied to government incentives—such as the CHIPS and Science Act, the Inflation Reduction Act, and state subsidy programs—which can impose strict timelines or otherwise be subject to phase-outs and volatile political headwinds. Private credit can close in weeks as opposed to months for a syndicated process. That can determine whether a grant is secured or lost—or whether a manufacturer can outrace its competitors competing for specialized domestic workforces, favorable new supply chains, and government contracts prioritizing domestic production.

Structural flexibility is equally vital. Reshoring projects often require heavy upfront investment, years before steady cash flow. Private lenders can tailor repayment to project realities, such as milestone-based drawdowns, long interest-only periods, or cash sweeps post‑production ramp-up, in contrast to the more rigid amortization and covenant demands common in syndicated loans. Furthermore, while prospective borrowers should carefully consider the costs and benefits of such approaches, private lenders are often more receptive partners to creative equity structures as a portion of their anticipated return on financing transactions than traditional bank lenders.

Specialized risks also make private credit attractive. Projects may involve advanced robotics, energy‑intensive methods, or other niche exposures and regulatory risks that traditional lenders may approach with skepticism. Private credit funds often field sector-focused teams capable of underwriting such risks without imposing prohibitive equity demands or overly restrictive covenants.

The Trade-offs: Cost, Liquidity, and Governance

Private credit is not cheap. Higher interest rates and fees, and the possible addition of equity compensation for the lender, reflect the lender’s concentrated risk and bespoke structuring. Borrowers must weigh whether the premium is justified by, among other things, speed and flexibility.

Liquidity is another consideration. Private loans are not broadly tradable; refinancing can be difficult, particularly when options were not plentiful to begin with or when a project encounters delays, increased costs, or other obstacles to profitability. If market conditions or project economics change, this lack of optionality can be constraining.

The close relationships that make private credit adaptable can also bring potentially intrusive governance. Enhanced reporting, board observer rights, and other operational oversight are common. Some management teams value the dialogue; others may resist the visibility granted to lenders.

Strategic Financing in a Strategic Moment

For manufacturers looking to reshore, capital constraints, bureaucracy, and inflexible financing can derail projects with long‑term strategic value for their businesses and the U.S. industrial base. Private credit can sidestep these obstacles by offering rapid, customized capital focused on the particular business, and execution of the particular reshoring project rather than market convention.

The trade-off is clear: higher costs in exchange for faster, more flexible capital. For many of our reshoring manufacturers, especially those racing to meet incentive deadlines or counter competitors, it’s a trade worth making. In an era when speed and flexibility rival cost of capital in importance, private credit may well become the financial engine behind America’s manufacturing resurgence.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.14205_3939.jpg,N,,2025-10-16 11:15:55.573022

2023), rejected the EPA's application of the Reactivation Policy to require the owners of an inactive refinery to obtain an NSR permit before restarting the operations of the refinery.
The Third Circuit reasoned that the CAA ""unambiguously limits"" the application of the NSR program to ""newly constructed or modified facilities,"" and that the EPA's Reactivation Policy extends the NSR program ""beyond those limited circumstances.""
Accordingly, ""EPA will no longer apply the Reactivation Policy to classify resuming operation of a stationary source as construction of a new source in EPA permitting and enforcement actions on a national basis.""
The recission of the Reactivation Policy is the latest in a series of EPA actions reforming the NSR program, following closely after the agency's new interpretation of ""Begin Actual Construction"" and reinstatement of its ""no second-guessing"" policy.","On September 18, 2025, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced a nationwide recission of its ""Reactivation Policy,"" which it had historically applied to determine whether a New Source Review (NSR) permit was required in order to resume the operation of an idle stationary source.

The Clean Air Act's (CAA) NSR provisions require the owner or operator of a facility to obtain a permit before constructing a new major stationary source or making a major modification at an existing major stationary source. Under the Reactivation Policy, EPA maintained that resuming operation of an idle facility that was determined to be ""permanently shut down"" constitutes the construction of a new stationary source, thereby triggering the requirement to obtain an NSR permit. EPA considered the intention of the owner or operator at the time of shutdown when determining whether the shutdown should be treated as permanent, examining factors such as the reason for the shutdown and the cost and time to reactivate the facility, among others. Additionally, EPA presumed that a major stationary source that was idle for two or more years was permanently shut down.

However, on July 25, 2023, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in Port Hamilton Refining and Transportation, LLLP v. U.S. EPA, 87 F. 4th 188 (3d Cir. 2023), rejected the EPA's application of the Reactivation Policy to require the owners of an inactive refinery to obtain an NSR permit before restarting the operations of the refinery. The Third Circuit reasoned that the CAA ""unambiguously limits"" the application of the NSR program to ""newly constructed or modified facilities,"" and that the EPA's Reactivation Policy extends the NSR program ""beyond those limited circumstances.""

EPA relies on this Third Circuit decision in justifying its recission of the Reactivation Policy, stating that although the ""Third Circuit did not vacate the Reactivation Policy itself, the court's reasoning leads to the inescapable conclusion that it is not permissible for EPA to apply that policy to require existing stationary sources to obtain a permit based solely on resuming operation of the source after a period of inactivity."" Accordingly, ""EPA will no longer apply the Reactivation Policy to classify resuming operation of a stationary source as construction of a new source in EPA permitting and enforcement actions on a national basis."" However, EPA stresses that it will continue to enforce the NSR applicability provisions relating to the modification of existing facilities in accordance with the CAA. That is, the ""restart of an idled facility involving a physical change (or a change in the method of operation at the source other than simply restarting) will still require [an NSR] permit if it qualifies as a 'major modification' by virtue of the nature of the change and the degree to which it results in an increase in regulated NSR pollutant emissions.""

The recission of the Reactivation Policy is the latest in a series of EPA actions reforming the NSR program, following closely after the agency's new interpretation of ""Begin Actual Construction"" and reinstatement of its ""no second-guessing"" policy. These recent changes mark a significant shift in EPA's application of the NSR program, and industry stakeholders should be on the lookout for more updates in this area.

Why it matters: Getting new interstate lines approved is really hard even as power demand rises, and grid analysts see lots of potential in boosting capacity along existing infrastructure and corridors.

State of play: The project will upgrade lines in Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Oklahoma, and West Virginia, per AEP and DOE.

The financing will support the replacement of lines in existing rights-of-way with new lines that can transmit more power, the company said.

AEP claimed that financing at a ""preferred interest rate"" will save its customers roughly $275 million over the life of the loan.

""This loan guarantee will not only help modernize the grid and expand transmission capacity but will help position the United States to win the AI race and grow our manufacturing base,"" Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in a statement.

The intrigue: Republicans once assailed loan guarantees (see Solyndra) but have come to embrace them for preferred projects.

DOE, in Thursday's announcement, credited changes to the program in the GOP budget law.

Flashback: The Biden administration announced the conditional commitment of this loan just days before President Trump took office earlier this year.

""This one started under the Biden administration, but it's a good project,"" Wright told reporters. ""Not all of them are nonsense.""

Zoom in: Wright compared this project to another loan guarantee the department canceled for what would have been for a wholly new power line — Invenergy's Grain Belt Express — connecting renewable energy in the Great Plains to other parts of the country.

Wright said it was a lot more expensive (because it was a new power line) and was capitalizing on an ""arbitrage"" of stranded renewable energy.

""Most private energy development is funded by private capital, as it should be,"" Wright said. ""We're looking for those cases where bringing in government capital is necessary.""

Court dismisses suit against EPA

A federal court has dismissed a lawsuit brought by farmers who claimed the Environmental Protection Agency failed to regulate per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, known as ""forever chemicals.""

The plaintiffs have a 60-day window to appeal the decision, which was handed down Sept. 29. The plaintiffs included farmers from Johnson County, Texas; Maine Organic Farmers and Gardeners Association; and Potomac Riverkeeper Inc., according to a news release from the University of Arkansas System Division of Agriculture.

Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, refer to a large family of chemicals that break down very slowly, earning their moniker ""forever chemicals."" PFAS became widespread in the mid-20th century due to their water- and grease-resistant properties. They have been used in a variety of consumer products from cookware to food packaging and fire extinguishing foam.

In the last few decades, research has linked PFAS with several health risks including developmental delays in children and cancer. Because PFAS takes such a long time to break down and were so widely used, they can be present in water, soil, air and food.

""Specifically, the plaintiffs claimed that EPA had failed to perform its mandatory Clean Water Act or CWA, duty to identify and regulate at least 18 distinct PFAS pollutants in the sewage sludge that plaintiffs and others use as fertilizer on their farming operations,"" said Brigit Rollins, attorney with the National Agricultural Law Center. ""Additionally, the plaintiffs claimed that EPA failed to adopt regulations that provide restrictions on additional PFAS pollutants that the agency had previously identified.

""However, a federal court has disagreed, finding that the EPA did not violate its CWA duties,"" Rollins said. ""While the court ultimately dismissed the case, it did indicate what future actions the plaintiffs might take to prompt EPA to adopt stricter PFAS regulations.""

In its 10-page decision, the court explained that the EPA had not violated the Clean Water Act either by failing to identify the pollutants in its most recent biennial sewage sludge report or by failing to adopt regulations to manage the pollutants it has already identified as present in sewage sludge known as biosolids.

The court said that the plain language of the act requires the EPA to review its existing sewage sludge regulations every two years in order to ""facilitate the subsequent identification and regulation of pollutants,"" Rollins said. For that reason, the court found that the EPA had not violated the act by failing to identify the 18 PFAS pollutants in its most recent biennial report.

""The court dismissed the case without prejudice, leaving open the possibility that the plaintiffs could refile the claims on a later date,"" she said. ""Additionally, the court suggested other avenues that the plaintiffs could pursue to prompt EPA to more strictly regulate PFAS.""",https://wehco.media.clients.ellingtoncms.com/static-4/teaser_images/www.pbcommercial.com_default.jpg,N,,2025-10-16 11:15:32.456725

“The way to victory is to talk about price,” the Hawaii Democrat said at a New York Times event last month.
Republican Jack Ciattarelli is blaming outgoing Democratic Gov.
But there’s still a risk that action to curb climate change will remain the scapegoat, even as its consequences have long since arrived.","“It’s an issue that I think we need to continue to engage on and speak out on and work to legislate on, but it’s not a top three issue right now,” Sen. Chris Coons, the Democratic co-chair of the Senate’s bipartisan Climate Solutions Caucus, told me.

In a recent op-ed, Coons pinned Delaware’s rising electricity costs on Trump — and didn’t mention climate once.

Indeed, party leaders are trying a two-pronged affordability-centered strategy: tying higher electricity bills nationwide to Republicans’ dismantling of their signature climate package, while also downplaying climate policies within the states Democrats do control.

Coons, one of former President Joe Biden’s closest allies, added, “Let’s put it this way: American voters clearly didn’t give the Biden-Harris administration and Democrats the credit we hoped they would for transformational investments in energy, and that sent a signal to Trump that he could reverse, defund or cut lots of investments in new energy generation, grid stability, energy research, new energy sources for the United States.”

In other words: While climate legislation didn’t lose Democrats the election, it didn’t not lose it, either.

Sen. Brian Schatz, perhaps the Democrats’ most articulate orator on climate right now, is also preaching a message of affordability.

“The way to victory is to talk about price,” the Hawaii Democrat said at a New York Times event last month. “You could talk about the planetary emergency and mitigation and adaptation, and you could throw in some environmental justice rhetoric, and by the time you’re done talking, people think you don’t care about them.”

There will be plenty of opportunities to test out messaging. Electricity prices are projected to continue climbing, partly on the back of more and more AI data centers but partly on utilities’ increased spending to upgrade aging grid infrastructure.

It’s also notable that electricity tends to be cheaper in states with higher-than-average concentrations of wind and solar power, as my POLITICO colleagues Zack Colman and Catherine Allen reported. And Republicans’ repeal of much of the Inflation Reduction Act’s tax credits for renewable energy are estimated to raise electricity rates by 5-7 percent by 2030, according to the think tank Resources for the Future.

Democrats are already getting some wins under the affordability banner. Maryland Gov. Wes Moore, a potential White House contender, signed a package of energy bills in May, including to speed up solar permitting, all while touting the ability to curb utility costs.

Sometimes climate can even slip in alongside affordability, as in a legislative package that California Gov. Gavin Newsom, another likely 2028 aspirant, signed last month at a podium emblazoned with “Cutting utility bills. Cutting pollution.”

“This is not an ideological endeavor,” Newsom said in signing the bills, which extend the state’s carbon-trading program and direct some of its proceeds to electricity bill rebates while also easing permitting for new oil wells. State Republicans voted for that part, but some also voted for another part that broadens the state’s electric grid to make it easier to trade power across state lines.

“We’re in the practical application business,” Newsom said. “We’ve got to manifest our ideals and our goals. And so this lays it out, but it lays it out without laying tracks over folks.”

California environmentalists say it’s an example of how to keep talking about climate change, particularly in the current political climate.

“Our position has always been that addressing climate change is the cost-effective path forward,” said Victoria Rome, director of California government affairs for the Natural Resources Defense Council. “I don’t think the answer is to stop talking about it. I think the answer is to show people how the solutions are actually good for them, for their health, for their pocketbook.”

No affordability discourse these days is complete without a discussion of power prices in the mid-Atlantic, which have risen by as much as 35 percent since last year and are feeding into New Jersey’s tight gubernatorial race.

The obscurity of the actual culprit — the regional electric grid operator’s lack of urgency in connecting new energy projects — is letting both candidates get in their hits, as POLITICO E&E News’ Adam Aton and Timothy Cama note. Energy policy may not have decided the presidential election, but it could determine the next governor of New Jersey.

Republican Jack Ciattarelli is blaming outgoing Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy for closing power plants, and he’s proposing to pull the state out of a regional carbon-trading program; Democratic Rep. Mikie Sherrill is blaming Trump and pledging to freeze utility rates and reform the regional grid operator. But she’s also engaged in some self-flagellating.

“Sometimes our messaging in the Democratic Party — not great,” Sherrill said in a March interview. “For years we’ve said, ‘We need to move into clean power.’ And there’s almost been this understanding, ‘It’s going to cost you an arm and a leg, but if you’re a good person, you’ll do it.’ So now that we’re actually in that place that we promised — it was going to be cheaper than any other source of power — people are skeptical.”

Ciattarelli weaponized that “arm and a leg” excerpt last month in ads that took Sherrill’s statement out of context.

Slightly removed from the heat of the campaign, there’s actually bipartisan agreement that the grid operator needs fixing. Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, a Democrat and Republican, respectively, who both might be eyeing 2028, are both threatening to pull their states out of the organization that currently operates their electric grid.

But there’s still a risk that action to curb climate change will remain the scapegoat, even as its consequences have long since arrived.

David Hill, executive vice president of the energy program at the Bipartisan Policy Center, noted that when electricity supplies were ample, there was less of a need to focus on reliability and affordability when talking climate. Now, those are the public’s key concerns and so climate advocates are facing “some pretty severe pushback,” even as there’s only so much they can do.

The Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) grid saw 7.6GW of new utility-scale PV capacity in 2024, followed by the Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO) grid (6GW) and the non-ISO grids in the West and Southeast (largely Florida), both with 4.7GW of new utility-scale solar capacity.

The report provides a range of granular data on utility-scale PV deployments and the market at large.

Utility-scale solar costs

Berkeley Lab’s report showed that the average capacity-weighted cost of installed utility-scale solar rose fractionally from 2023 to 2024; from US$1.59/Wac to US$1.61/Wac. The “robust” 2024 data is based on records from 425 projects, which Berkeley said was 92% of new projects.

However, the cost of utility-scale PV varied significantly by region and grid. ERCOT saw the lowest prices, under US$1.5/Wac, while most other ISOs saw prices around the US$1.5/Wac mark. The outlier was the New York Independent System Operator (NYISO), which saw prices over US$2/Wac.

Berkeley Lab said this variation was due to land availability, prevailing labour rates and transmission network upgrade costs

The national average levelised cost of energy (LCOE) for utility-scale PV rose by 13% last year, from US$53/MWh to US$60/MWh without tax credits, and from US$36/MWh to US$41/MWh with Investment or Production tax credits. Higher financing costs, increasing capex and slightly lower estimated performance pushed the national average LCOE up, the report said.

Single-axis trackers dominate, c-Si grows

Almost all (99%) new utility-scale solar projects deployed single-axis trackers instead of fixed-tilt mounts last year. Just 12 projects deployed fixed-tilt racking in 2024, compared with 236 tracker-mounted installations.

The cost of tracker systems fell in 2024, which, combined with the tracker projects’ higher energy yield per installed capacity, made tracker systems far more attractive to project owners. Fixed-tilt systems are only now found in “challenging” environments, such as areas with extreme terrain or high risk of adverse weather.

Last year also saw a significant expansion in the deployment of c-Si solar technology at utility-scale. Annual c-Si solar capacity almost doubled in 2024, reaching 23.4GW compared with around 13.3GW in 2023.

By contrast, thin-film deployments remained fairly constant, rising by under 1GW from 5.24GW in 2023 to 6.13GW in 2024. This is likely because the US only has one major thin-film module producer, First Solar.

The US had 79.19GW of utility-scale c-Si solar capacity and 30.74GW of utility-scale thin-film capacity as of the end of 2024.

Corporate offtakers surge

Corporations were the biggest buyers of utility-scale solar power in the US last year, a first for the industry.

Corporate offtakers signed power purchase agreements (PPA) for 9.8GW of utility-scale solar power in 2024, representing 33% of all deals signed. Investor-owned utilities signed PPAs for 5.4GW, monopoly investor-owned utilities 5.2GW and public utilities 4.6GW.

This marks the first time that corporations have led the offtake figures, according to Berkeley Lab’s publicly available data, and 2024 also saw corporate PPA capacities more than double. Last year, corporate PPAs amounted to 4.7GW, trailing the 6GW agreed by investor-owned utilities.

The corporate solar PPA sector really kicked off in 2020, when annual deals rose from 684MW to over 2.2GW. Barring a slump in 2022 it rose gradually, by around 1GW a year, before jumping substantially in 2024.

US big tech companies have led corporate solar power deals in recent times. Giants like Amazon, Google and Meta have all inked multiple GWs of deals for utility-scale solar, largely to support the operation of data centres.",https://www.pv-tech.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/darmau-hYfOeNvDXWg-unsplash.jpg,N,,2025-10-16 11:14:17.767002

Explore how the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) reshapes IRA tax credit access and accelerates the timeline for action for your campus.

As higher education institutions across the country continue to grapple with aging infrastructure and sustainability commitments, the energy incentives in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA) have been a vital tool in making clean energy projects financially feasible. By reducing upfront costs for solar, battery storage, central utility plants and other clean energy technologies, the IRA has helped institutions improve infrastructure resiliency and advance sustainability goals while preserving capital. The IRA made sure these benefits were accessible to tax-exempt institutions through the direct pay provision of the law, allowing not-for-profits to receive the Investment Tax Credits and/or Production Tax Credits (ITC/PTC) as a refundable cash payment not previously available to tax-exempt organizations, a game changer for higher education.

What is the One Big Beautiful Bill Act?

On July 4, 2025, President Trump signed the sweeping tax reform and spending reconciliation bill known as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) into law. While the legislation addresses a broad range of issues, it notably revises several energy tax incentives introduced under the IRA. As one of the most consequential amendments to the IRA, future credit claimants have been busy trying to understand how these statutory changes interact with existing guidance.

The OBBBA preserves the direct pay option, ensuring that colleges and universities can still access clean energy incentives directly. However, it also accelerates the phase-out of certain tax credit funding provisions for clean energy power generation projects, narrowing the window for higher education institutions to benefit. Institutions can still take advantage of funding opportunities for projects like solar energy and geothermal energy installations, but timing is critical. Those institutions with projects underway should move quickly, while others may need to identify new clean energy projects this year if they want to utilize their benefits.

Furthermore, the legislation narrows access to certain benefits by imposing more restrictive rules on involvement with foreign entities of concern, setting new qualification deadlines and gradually phasing out select provisions. Many clean energy incentives remain in place, but with more limited windows of opportunity and stricter compliance standards. As a result, the urgency for educational institutions to start is great than ever.

How does the OBBBA affect higher education energy projects?

Solar

The Commercial Solar ITC under IRC Section 48E imposes a tighter construction window: schools must break ground by July 4, 2026, or bring systems online by Dec. 31, 2027, to secure funding. Fortunately, opportunities remain, but you need to get started to secure the solar tax credit funding.

Energy storage

A bright spot for institutions is in energy storage, an area that remains favorably treated under the OBBBA. The full ITC is still available for standalone battery storage systems through 2033, giving institutions ample time to plan campus-scale installations with robust federal backing. Even as solar incentives phase out, pairing energy storage with leased or safe-harbored solar systems may help offset cost impacts and sustain long-term sustainability goals.

Fuel cells and linear generators

Fuel cells, including linear generators offer a compelling opportunity under OBBBA as the incentives are built to last. Eligible fuel cell and linear generator systems that generate electricity now qualify for a base 30% ITC, offering a new option for distributed generation on campus with heat recovery where needed. Unlike solar and wind technologies facing early sunsets, fuel cells and linear generator projects remain federally supported if projects begin construction after Dec. 31, 2025, through the end of 2035.

Electric vehicles (EVs) and EV chargers

Colleges and universities considering alternative fuel vehicles to add to their fleet must move swiftly. Federal credits including the Commercial Clean Vehicle Credit (45W) and EV incentives (30D and 25E) expire after Sept. 30, 2025, while refueling infrastructure support under Section 30c ends by June 30, 2026.

Incentives in action: Our work on campuses

Baker Tilly has worked with numerous colleges and universities over the past few years, helping them take advantage of clean energy incentives for campus projects. Our energy and infrastructure team has helped these institutions understand their eligibility for clean energy tax credit funding and comply with myriad requirements needed to earn and keep these credits. This includes compliance with the prevailing wage and apprenticeship bonus credits (PW&A) requirements, domestic content bonus credit requirements and energy community bonus credit compliance requirements. Baker Tilly also helps guide institutions through the direct pay election process, allowing them to monetize tax credits as tax-exempt organizations. Our team also performs energy feasibility studies and cost segregation analyses to determine eligible property costs and optimize credit values. For example:

Baker Tilly is engaged with a major private university in the Northeast to secure federal clean energy tax credits for over $1 billion in energy initiatives, including geothermal and solar projects. Their planned solar installation generates approximately 1.9 megawatt-hours annually, covering around 17% of a key campus building's energy needs. Their campus-wide geothermal heating and cooling project will deliver ground-source thermal energy to meet more than half of the heating and cooling requirements for current and future buildings for a portion of the campus. These efforts support the university's sustainability and climate goals while enhancing energy infrastructure and reducing emissions by over 15%.

Baker Tilly is helping a private college in the Midwest to secure federal clean energy tax credits for a roughly $7 million thermal energy storage initiative. The project involves installing a thermal storage tank to shift electricity usage from daytime to nighttime, which helps reduce costs and lower demand charges by balancing energy consumption. Baker Tilly is supporting the college through the pre-construction phase by evaluating eligibility and ensuring compliance with tax credit requirements. The team will continue assisting through commissioning to help maximize and substantiate the credit, including adherence to PW&A standards for final tax filings.

Act now! What should your institution do next?

Assess your energy project pipeline

Identify capital projects that could qualify for OBBBA-related credits, grants or financing mechanisms

Update your facilities and finance teams on funding opportunities

Ensure that key internal teams are informed about the OBBBA provisions and prepared to act quickly as funding opportunities and compliance requirements emerge

Furthermore, it could also help drivers sell stored energy to the grid and recoup some of their charging costs while incentivizing the construction of more renewable energy generators.

Letting electric vehicles strategically charge from and discharge to the grid could spark environmental and public health benefits for Americans, according to a new study from the University of Michigan and Carnegie Mellon University.

For one, it could reduce greenhouse gas and other air emissions in a way that would more than offset what’s produced when charging EVs. In addition to mitigating climate change, this reduction in emissions would help alleviate some of the damaging health impacts and costs.

Furthermore, it could also help drivers sell stored energy to the grid and recoup some of their charging costs while incentivizing the construction of more renewable energy generators.

“These new installations would decarbonize not only EVs, but other parts of the whole power system,” said Jiahui Chen, a lead author of the new study and U-M doctoral student in environment and sustainability. “By adding EV flexible loads, you actually reduce emissions from the entire grid.”

The project was funded by U-M’s School for Environment and Sustainability, as well as Carnegie Mellon’s Department of Engineering and Public Policy and Department of Mechanical Engineering.

After solar panels and wind turbines are built, they provide nearly free energy without any greenhouse gas emissions. Unfortunately, nature doesn’t work on our schedules. Without robust storage solutions, the clean energy that’s made when the sun’s shining and the wind is blowing is wasted when its supply exceeds the demand.

Companies are starting to roll out new large-scale storage technologies to try and change that. But researchers have also realized a growing number of Americans could have another established solution sitting in their garages: electric vehicles. By strategically charging EVs and enabling them to send their stored energy at appropriate times to the grid, Americans could access more affordable energy with less emissions.

“You’d think if you’re buying more electricity, you’d be creating more emissions, but it turns out you can actually reverse it, if you charge your vehicle at the right time. We call it ‘negative vehicle emissions,'” said study senior co-author Jeremy Michalek, professor of mechanical engineering and of engineering and public policy at Carnegie Mellon.

Central to these gains are two intertwined ideas that aren’t brand new, but also aren’t yet widely implemented in the U.S. The first is this idea of charging at the right time, or smart charging, when the grid is flush with energy from renewable sources.

The second key component is what’s referred to as vehicle-to-grid, or V2G. With V2G, EV drivers could sell their stored clean energy to the grid when demand is high, instead of power plants needing to burn more fossil fuels to meet energy needs.

“There are times when wind and solar are generating so much power that it cannot be consumed and, sadly, we have to waste that,” Chen said. “We can use EVs to absorb that otherwise wasted very cheap, very clean energy. We can then use that energy at a later time, when it would cost more, and avoid burning fossil fuels to make it.”

The combination of smart charging and V2G would support a system that incentivizes the building of more renewable energy plants. Once they are built, these resources can inject clean energy into the grid whenever they produce it, because wind and sunshine are free while oil and gas are not.

“Once you have that wind and solar in place, it generates first. It displaces coal and natural gas even when EVs aren’t charging. It’s like the EVs trigger the building of these plants that then can run and displace fossil fuels all the time,” Michalek said. “This low carbon infrastructure can supply everybody else who uses electricity as well.”

The team is not the first to consider the ramifications of V2G and smart charging. But it is the first to model their impacts in a more comprehensive manner that accounts for their influence on the evolution of renewable energy in the country.

“We tend to think of these things as separate and static. For example, there’s a bunch of studies—including ones that I’ve done and Jeremy has done—that try to figure out whether electric vehicles cut emissions or not with a static grid,” said Parth Vaishnav, senior co-author of the study and U-M professor of environment and sustainability.

“But as things start electrifying and start interacting, it’s incomplete to answer questions about one system without accounting for how it might change how another system is built and operated.”

This modeling also used a fairly conservative outlook, Chen said. For example, it did not assume federal incentives, like the recently expired tax credits in the Inflation Reduction Act for renewable energy. The researchers also considered scenarios that allowed for the deployment of large, stationary battery banks to store energy from the grid. While the details varied in those scenarios, the take-home messages remained the same, the authors said.

“EVs could still produce a lot of substantial benefits,” Chen said. “You could say there is an additive relationship.”

Michael Craig, U-M associate professor of environment and sustainability and of industrial and operations engineering, also contributed to the study, as did Matthew Bruchon, who worked on the project as a doctoral student at Carnegie Mellon.",https://news.umich.edu/wp-content/uploads/mc-image-cache/2025/10/letting-evs-take-a-load-off-the-grid-could-result-in-negative-emissions-while-saving-drivers-money-v2g_illustration.png,N,,2025-10-16 11:16:02.170024

During the first nine months of 2025, DEP also reviewed and acted on 30,430 permit applications and conducted 88,799 inspections of regulated facilities to ensure compliance with environmental laws.

40,978 of those inspections are from the Oil and Gas Program.

DEP inspections include both scheduled and unscheduled on-site visits to permitted facilities, as well as document reviews to verify compliance with environmental laws and regulations.

These inspections – whether on-site or operational – ensure air emissions stay within air quality standards, drinking water remains safe, and rivers and streams are protected from pollution.

DEP launched the SPEED program on June 30 for Chapter 102 stormwater management permit applications, and for certain Air Quality Plan Approvals, earth disturbance, dam safety, and individual water obstruction and encroachment permits in August.

There are 5 permits currently under review in the SPEED program.

DEP is modernizing its permitting process by investing in new technology and reviewing processes to identify and eliminate bottlenecks.

In January, DEP launched a Permit Tracker to allow applicants and residents to monitor the progress of permits as they move through the review process.

Since 2023, DEP has also added 225 employees to carry out critical functions like public health and safety inspections and permit application reviews.

DEP has also implemented the PAyback program, which went into effect in November 2023 that assures a moneyback guarantee for permit applicants if their application is overdue for review by DEP.

Since the PAyback program was implemented, DEP has evaluated and decided on more than 76,000 permits without having to refund a single application fee.

DEP reviews more than 45,000 permit applications every year.

These include permits for land clearing activities for construction projects, air quality permits for factories and power plants, permits to upgrade drinking water systems to remove chemicals like PFAS ‘forever chemicals,’ mining activity, and permits for oil and gas wells.

With more efficient permit review from DEP, businesses in Pennsylvania can put shovels in the ground more quickly while still ensuring their projects meet standards to protect clean air and clean water.

The first test was the planned construction of a $3.5 billion power plant called Kaiparowits.
It would have been located in southern Utah, right in the middle of several parks, including Bryce Canyon, Zion, Grand Canyon, and Capitol Reef.
Redford began his journey as an environmental activist opposing Kaiparowits, and he very much had Stegner on the brain.
Redford’s appearance on 60 Minutes resulted in more than 6,000 letters to the show, most opposing the plant.","On April 17, 1976, over 500 residents of the small town of Kanab, Utah, cheered as they set fire to an effigy of a movie star wearing a blond wig.

To understand why, back up 22 years before then, to a time when a teenager named Charles Robert Redford Jr. made a detour on a road as he drove back from college in Boulder, Colorado, to his home in Los Angeles. A small ski resort, Timp Haven, occupied the spot he would later call Sundance.

“When I left, I couldn’t shake it off,” he said in Michael Feeney Callan’s biography, Robert Redford. “I lay in bed and thought about it. And whenever I had the chance to go back, I did. It became my favorite long shortcut, the only way to go home. I have a clear recollection of thinking, 'Someday I’d like to put a stake down here.’”

He did just that a few years later when he paid $500 for two acres. The land he found that day, in the shadow of Mount Timpanogos, would change his life. It was there that his love of the West would deepen, and out of that love grew his desire to fight for and protect it.

The first test was the planned construction of a $3.5 billion power plant called Kaiparowits.

*

Robert Redford knew the West.

He had rafted on the Colorado River, trekked into canyons, and, while shooting the timeless classic Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, first encountered the Kaiparowits Plateau.

“Having experienced the beauty and fragility of the area during filming for Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, I just couldn’t accept the idea that constructing a power plant in that location was a good one,” he said to his grandson Conner during one of his very last interviews in Orion magazine.

The Kaiparowits coal-fired plant was first proposed by Southern California Edison in 1965—a massive 3,000-megawatt installation slated to be the largest coal-fired plant in the world. It would have been located in southern Utah, right in the middle of several parks, including Bryce Canyon, Zion, Grand Canyon, and Capitol Reef. The plant, if it had been built, would have polluted both the water and air, emitting sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides, as well as potential mercury poisoning. The plant was conceived as a source of power for California markets, a kind of electrical Chinatown.

At the time, Redford was not only exploring the West, he was reading it. Wallace Stegner, who wrote of the region as an arid, vulnerable, and threatened place, was among his favorite writers. Redford began his journey as an environmental activist opposing Kaiparowits, and he very much had Stegner on the brain.

“It was my first major conservation issue,” he told Callan, “and what I discovered very quickly was the mass of ignorance out there. It’s not just the greed of industrialists. It’s the lack of fundamental awareness, a mindset created over 150 years that says Manifest Destiny allows us to do what we will with the land. My passion came from the pages of Wallace Stegner, who prided himself on attachment to the land. We flew over the Escalante rocks, this paradise that had been untouched for millennia, and I thought about what Stegner had written: that here was a place where the silence allows you to hear the swish of falling stars.”

To his credit, Redford did not just lend his famous face to these environmental efforts. As Stegner once wrote, “Environmentalism or conservation or preservation or whatever it should be called, is not a fact, and never has been. It is a job.”

The job required sitting through dull meetings and the dirty work of lobbying. Right away, Redford took to it like an avid student. He did the boring stuff. He worked closely with the Natural Resource Defense Council, learning directly from John Adams, the president of the NRDC, who taught him the sometimes frustrating art of talking to members of Congress, trying, often futilely, to keep them to their words. It turned out they were willing to give some of their time to a movie star, but they could also say one thing to his face and another when it came time to vote.

Of course, he could get some things done many environmental activists could not, such as calling up 60 Minutes, which offered him a national forum to explain how the Kaiparowits plant would destroy the air and water in southern Utah. Redford’s appearance on 60 Minutes resulted in more than 6,000 letters to the show, most opposing the plant.

“I had to be careful,” he told the Deseret News. “I was very much aware of the double-edged sword of being a celebrity because there are a lot of people who resent you speaking out, who feel you have not earned the right, that you do not have the credibility and so forth. So I decided to really look at this plan because, in my gut, I felt it would be a terrible mistake. It was right in the middle of five contiguous national parks and monuments. We already had demonstrations of what other power plants had done to the quality of life in other areas.”

In his fight against Kaiparowits, Redford “requested the assistance of environmental groups, raised money to open an office in Salt Lake City, and hired a small staff to investigate the environmental and economic ramifications of the project.”

In large part thanks to Redford’s efforts and a coalition of environmental organizations, including the Sierra Club, Southern California Edison abandoned its plans to develop the plant.

It was a big victory for the environmental movement, but not everyone was pleased. After the news that the plant would not be built, hundreds of people in Kanab, where many believed the power plant would have been an economic boon, hung an effigy of the actor in protest.

“This is the time and day that we, the people of Kane County, have chosen to put a torch to skunkman Redford, self‐proclaimed voice of the hypocritical obstructionists,” John Nelson, the county engineer, told The New York Times at the time.

Redford was nonplussed. From Stegner, he had learned the timeworn ideal of stewardship of the land. Adams believed that the experience taught him a valuable lesson. In his autobiography, A Force of Nature, Adams remembered: “In Kanab, Utah, Bob was burned in effigy by people who blamed him for the loss of jobs and cheap energy. They called him an extremist and a backpacking kook. His family received threatening letters. He had been in the lion's den. One was that the bitterness that had marked the fight against Southern California Edison was something to be avoided, if possible. Perhaps there was a way to bring all parties in a dispute to the table and see what common ground existed to pursue this idea.”

The rest of Redford’s career as an environmentalist would be marked by a search for that common ground.

*

As for Kaiparowits, in 1996, Redford celebrated the creation of Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument, which included the land where the Kaiparowits power plant would have been built. He’d fought hard for Grand Staircase, a then 1.7-million-acre expanse of land, with President Clinton singling him out as a key influence in the effort to create the monument. He stood beside Clinton during the official declaration.

Unfortunately, Clinton’s team decided to have the dedication ceremony not in Utah where the monument would be, but on the South Rim of the Grand Canyon in Arizona. No one, least of all Redford, understood why, perhaps out of a somewhat understandable fear of angry locals. This move was regarded as a perfect example of the hypocrisy of outsiders determining the fate of Utah’s land. Though Redford was far from an outsider at that point, having lived on and off in Utah for 35 years, he would always be regarded that way by some.

As for the small towns like Kanab bordering Grand Staircase-Escalante, the hotbeds of the anger about the declaration where the movie star was hung in effigy, the outrage gradually died down.

For now the wilderness protections are holding. But, as Redford would learn over the years, environmental victories can be tentative until there’s another reason to step forward and take a stand to protect our land, air, and water.

Robert Redford, during his life, did just that.",https://www.sierraclub.org/sites/default/themes/custom/bootzine/favicon.ico,N,,2025-10-16 11:16:08.055953

For the past few years, charging networks, delivery fleets and retail hubs have been hustling to add infrastructure to provide juice to electric cars. The next step: helping drivers sell excess electrons back to the grid.

In August, ChargePoint Holdings Inc., a Silicon Valley-based company that operates roughly 35,000 fast-charging ports in the US, announced a new kind of station that will pump power to and from vehicles, as opposed to the vast majority of chargers, which simply take electrons from the grid.

ChargePoint hopes the system will win business from companies that operate large fleets of vehicles by providing the opportunity to sell the electrons sitting in idle cars and trucks.

“We’ll start to be able to go to electric fleets and reduce the cost straight up — no incentives, no tax breaks, no grants — versus a [gas-powered] fleet,” said CEO Rick Wilmer.

Charging networks have long angled to serve vehicle fleets, such as delivery companies, rideshare outfits and construction contractors, that typically have a large and predictable power demand. ChargePoint reckons the next phase of charging competition will be helping those companies monetize their vehicles. When the vehicles are idle and have extra electrons, they can uncork a tiny trickle of revenue, or at least help power nearby buildings. Often, these fleets are idle at the end of a work day, precisely when power demand is peaking on the typical grid.

“You’re ending up with a significantly better mousetrap,” Wilmer said.

At the same time, there’s a push among many companies to generate and store electricity onsite to safeguard against outages, arbitrage time-of-use power prices or get off the grid entirely. Those sites will now be able to tap into vehicles as part of their energy mix, according to Eaton Corp., a power management company that is partnering with ChargePoint on the new charging system. The stations, which ChargePoint has dubbed Express Grid, will also use electricity generated onsite, say from solar panels or wind turbines.

Companies are “adding distributed energy resources such as solar, storage and wind,” said Paul Ryan, vice president and general manager of energy transition at Eaton. “Now you have EVs that are battery assets.”

To be sure, not all utilities can or will accept electricity from anything that isn’t a power plant. Likewise, many of today’s EVs can only accept electrons, not feed them the other way, a process known as bi-directional charging. For example, Ford Motor Co.’s electric pick-up truck, the F-150 Lightning, can discharge its battery, but the company’s electric crossover, the Mustang Mach-E, doesn’t have that capability.

But many analysts expect so-called bidirectional charging will soon be ubiquitous in the EV market. And with more volatile weather and the rise of power-hungry data centers, US utilities are scrambling to get electricity wherever they can find it.

While ChargePoint and Eaton unveiled their new charging system on Thursday, they have yet to take orders. The companies expect to install the first such unit in the second half of next year.

The proposed increase is far higher than typical rate hikes, and Liberty serves some of the most economically disadvantaged residents in Massachusetts. The company’s last rate case was in 2015.

Some customers in North Attleboro and Fall River would experience a monthly bill increase of approximately $78.86 (an approximate 37.0% increase in current rates) if the full rate hike is approved by regulators. Low-income residential customers in the area would be hit hard as well, experiencing a monthly bill increase of approximately $59.15 (a 37.0% increase), while low-income residential non-heating customers would experience a monthly bill increase of approximately $33.38, a staggering 80.9% increase.

Fall River has amongst the lowest median income per capita in the entire state at less than half the state average.

Currently, more than 1 in every 6 of Liberty’s residential customers (17%) are behind on paying their gas bills.

Removing Political Costs

Legislation introduced by State Senator Cynthia Creem and Representatives Steven Owens and Jennifer Armini this session would prohibit utilities from using ratepayer money for political, advocacy, and lavish expenses, which are unnecessary for the provision of safe and reliable service.

The bill prohibits utilities from charging their customers for lobbying; institutional or good will advertising, which is primarily designed to improve the image of the utility or the industry; litigation to influence, modify, or repeal existing federal, state or local regulations, legislation or ordinances; tax penalties or fines issued against a utility; travel, lodging, entertainment, gifts or food and beverage expenses for a utility’s board of directors and officers; aircraft for a utility’s board of directors; and investor relations.

The bill also prohibits utilities from using customer money to pay for attendance in contested proceedings conducted before the DPU, including rate case advocacy.

The legislation requires the state’s utilities to disclose those expenses annually and penalizes them for violations.

Portions of the legislation have been incorporated into Governor Maura Healey’s proposed package of utility affordability legislation.

Significant Savings

An analysis by EPI has found that in its current rate case, Liberty Utilities is seeking to recover from its customers some of the costs that would be prohibited by the utility accountability legislation. They include the following expenses:

Rate case expenses, which are the costs for the utility to submit its rate increase proposal to its regulator = $1,911,870 (to be recovered over the next 5 years, with a yearly recovery of $382,374). Over a third of those costs are for legal expenses.

Payments to trade associations and business groups = $124,376 ($112,414 industry + $11,962 non-industry)

Advertising = $24,884 (EPI removed over $19,000 in costs from an original sum submitted by Liberty as the utility marked them as “Regulatory Only” ads)

Investor Relations = $59,926

Board of Directors expenses = $82,901 (which Liberty says consist of “fees, benefits, and meeting costs”)

Together, these expenses total $674,461, on an annual basis.

With a total customer base of 60,976 (as of January 1, 2025), that would amount to over $11.06 in savings per customer, on average, per year.

Reached for comment, a Liberty Utilities spokesperson said via email: “As a matter of Company policy, Liberty does not comment on issues pertaining to on-going litigation. The Company is generally aware of the ongoing legislation you reference but has no additional comment regarding that legislation at this time.”

States Curbing Political Spending

If Massachusetts passes the accountability legislation, it would join a growing number of states who have taken similar action to rein in utility political cost recovery from customers. Most recently, California Governor Gavin Newsom signed such a bill into law this week. California joins Connecticut, Maine, and Colorado as states that have prohibited utilities from recovering expenses similarly to what legislators have proposed in Massachusetts.

Other states have passed laws prohibiting the recovery of narrower political costs such as lobbying and trade association dues, including New Hampshire, New York, and Maryland.",https://energyandpolicy.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Utility-Money-In-Politics.jpg,N,,2025-10-16 12:12:21.016688

The Georgia Power Company files a quarterly report that details the number of data center customers in the pipeline and their cumulative power demand.","Energy experts gathered in Raleigh this week to discuss how North Carolina’s energy grid — and ratepayers’ wallets — will handle the incoming wave of new data centers.

A single data center can require over half the output of a nuclear reactor to power. Meanwhile, a typical facility may only employ around 50 full-time employees once constructed and increase power bills for ratepayers statewide in the long run.

With the rise of AI and other internet services driving up data center demand, North Carolina utility commissioner Tommy Tucker and the rest of the commission must determine how much ratepayers will subsidize the required grid upgrades.

“I’m just thinking about the guy out there in rural North Carolina [who] needs a good-paying job, why wouldn’t we go after that load and kind of side step some of the data centers?” Tucker asked during the hearing.

In addition to transmission improvements and tax revenue, Lucas Fykes, energy policy director for the Data Center Coalition, said data centers play a role in the broader economy:

“As you bring in data centers to North Carolina, you’re also going to bring in other operations that depend on data centers and that depend on reducing that latency, that data transfer time,” Fykes said.

Building beyond the next five years

Commissioners will use the information presented during this week’s hearing to inform their decision on Duke Energy’s 2025 resource plan. That plan forecasted an unprecedented rise in energy demand, which would grow at eight times the rate it had during the preceding 15 years.

“In the rush to meet customer demand, utilities may resort to resource portfolios that do not cost-efficiently serve the load that actually materializes and may hinder some long-term resource planning goals,” said Jeffrey Bower, a consultant with Daymark Energy Advisers.

Bower said utilities run the risk of building too much new infrastructure to serve data center projects that never come to fruition. The utility might also choose to invest in quickly buildable generators, like natural gas turbines, but ultimately won’t serve at their full capacity for the duration of their useful lifetime.

Commissioner Karen Kemerait echoed those concerns.

“We also want to make sure that we're not over-forecasting and then overbuilding the system for load that doesn't actually show up,” Kemerait said.

Fykes responded that utilities and state regulators should review companies’ histories to see if they have a track record of delivering on past projects.

“Utilities commissions should be required to publicly disclose the key assumptions, data sources and validation processes underlying both [their] base forecasts and the supplemental inputs,” Fykes said.

Building on spec

The North Carolina Utilities Commission does not directly forecast load growth. Duke Energy submits an energy demand forecast during the biennial resource planning process. The challenge for the utility and state regulators is to account for speculative development requests.

Some data center developers are exploring sites in multiple states for the same project, inflating nationwide energy demand forecasts. A Sierra Club analysis of 23 utilities found that the prospective data centers in their pipelines would require as much energy as the entire country currently generates.

“Clearly, there's a lot of speculation in that overall pipeline,” said Jeremy Fisher, principal advisor for climate and energy at Sierra Club. “It's the lack of transparency about what underlies those forecasts that actually creates the real risk on our system.”

That risk, he said, is building too much energy infrastructure and overbilling ratepayers to pay for ir. If utilities don’t publish what’s in their pipelines, then it can be challenging to account for speculative requests made across multiple states.

Some states have already taken action to improve transparency. The Georgia Power Company files a quarterly report that details the number of data center customers in the pipeline and their cumulative power demand.

“That allows the commission to understand who's joining the pipeline, who's leaving, why are they leaving, how is it affecting the megawatts,” Bower said.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/00777b9/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2400x1260+0+117/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F43%2Fa4%2Faac00466405ebc69d954944bb18d%2F2025-load-forecast-comparison-7percent.png,N,,2025-10-16 13:05:04.059708

China’s clean energy push – and coal expansion While the United States is cutting renewable energy funding, China is doubling down on clean energy technologies.
The plan focuses on increasing clean energy production, improving energy efficiency and diversifying oil and gas supplies away from Russia.
Europe does appear to be gaining in one way from the U.S. pullback from clean energy.
Thirty years into global climate talks, the disconnect between promises and practices has never been so clear.","Fossil fuels still power much of the world, even though renewable energy has become cheaper in most places and avoids both pollution and the climate damage caused by burning coal, oil and natural gas.

To understand this paradox, it helps to look at how countries – particularly major greenhouse gas emitters, including the U.S., China and European nations – are balancing the pressures of rising electricity demand with the global need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that are warming the planet.

US embraces fossil fuels

The United States makes no secret of its fossil fuel ambitions. It has a wealth of fossil fuel reserves and a politically powerful oil and gas industry.

Since President Donald Trump took office in January 2025, his administration has been promoting oil and gas drilling and coal production, pointing to rising electricity demand to justify its moves, particularly to power artificial intelligence data centers.

Reviving the “drill, baby, drill” mantra, the Trump administration has now embraced a “mine, baby, mine” agenda to try to revive U.S. coal production, which fell dramatically over the past two decades as cheaper natural gas and renewable energy rose.

The Department of Interior on Sept. 29 rolled out a plan to “unleash American coal power” by opening 13 million acres of federal land to mining. The Department of Energy also pledged US$625 million to try to make coal competitive. It includes lowering the royalty rates mining companies pay and extending the operating lifespans of coal-fired power plants.

However, these initiatives further lock communities with coal plants into a carbon-intensive fossil fuel. Coal’s resurgence would also have public health costs. Its pollution is linked to respiratory illness, heart disease and thousands of premature deaths each year from 1999 to 2020 in the United States.

The Trump administration is also ceding the clean energy technology race to China. The administration is ending many renewable energy tax credits and pulling federal support for energy research projects.

I work in the Climate Policy Lab at The Fletcher School of Tufts University, where we maintain a suite of databases for analyzing countries’ energy research budgets. The Trump administration’s 2026 U.S. budget request would slash funding for energy research, development and demonstration to $2.9 billion — just over half the budget allocated in 2025. These energy research investments would fall to levels not seen since the mid-1980s or early 2000s, even when accounting for inflation.

China’s clean energy push – and coal expansion

While the United States is cutting renewable energy funding, China is doubling down on clean energy technologies. Its large government subsidies and manufacturing capacity have helped China dominate global solar panel production and supply chains for wind turbines, batteries and electric vehicles.

Cheaper Chinese-manufactured clean energy technologies have enabled many emerging economies, such as Brazil and South Africa, to reduce fossil fuel use in their power grids. Brazil surged into the global top five for solar generation in 2024, producing 75 terawatt-hours (TWh) of electricity and surpassing Germany’s 71 TWh.

The International Energy Agency now expects global renewable energy capacity to double by 2030, even with a sharp drop expected in U.S. renewable energy growth.

However, while China expands clean energy access around the world, its production and emissions from coal continue to rise: In the first half of 2025, China commissioned 21 gigawatts (GW) of new coal power plants, with projections of over 80 GW for the full year. This would be the largest surge in new coal power capacity in a decade for China. Although China pledged to phase down its coal use between 2026 to 2030, rising energy demand may make the plan difficult to realize.

China’s paradox — leading in clean energy innovations while expanding coal — reflects the tension between ensuring energy security and reducing emissions and climate impact.

Europe’s scramble for reliable energy sources

The European Union is pursuing strategies to reduce its reliance on fossil fuels amid the ongoing geopolitical tensions with Russia.

Russia’s invasion of Ukraine exposed many countries to supply disruptions and geopolitical turmoil, and it triggered a global energy crisis as countries once reliant on Russian oil and gas scrambled to find alternatives.

In June 2025, the European Commission proposed a regulation to phase out Russian fossil fuel imports by the end of 2027, aiming to enhance energy security and stabilize prices. This initiative is part of the broader REPowerEU plan. The plan focuses on increasing clean energy production, improving energy efficiency and diversifying oil and gas supplies away from Russia.

Renewables are now the leading source of electric power in the EU, though natural gas and oil still account for more than half of Europe’s total energy supply.

The EU’s fossil energy phaseout plan also faces challenges. Slovakia and Hungary have expressed resistance to the proposed phaseout, citing concerns over energy affordability and the need for alternative supply sources. Hungarian Prime Minister Victor Orbán said Hungary would continue importing Russian oil and gas. Cutting off these supplies, he asserted, would be an economic “disaster” and immediately reduce Hungary’s economic output by 4%.

The path to reducing Europe’s dependence on fossil fuels thus involves navigating internal disagreements and incentivizing long-run sustainable development. Europe does appear to be gaining in one way from the U.S. pullback from clean energy. Global investment in renewable energy, which hit a record high in the first half of 2025, increased in the EU as it fell in the U.S., according to BloombergNEF’s analysis.

Brazil: Torn on fossil fuels as it hosts climate talks

In November 2025, representatives from countries around the world will gather in Brazil for the annual United Nations climate conference, COP30. The meeting marks three decades of international climate negotiations and a decade since nations signed the Paris Agreement to limit global temperature rise.

The conference’s setting in Belém, a city in the Amazon rainforest, reflects both the stakes and contradictions of climate commitments: a vital ecosystem at risk of collapse as the planet warms, in a nation that pledges climate leadership while expanding oil and gas production and exploring for oil in the Foz do Amazonas region, the mouth of the Amazon River.

Thirty years into global climate talks, the disconnect between promises and practices has never been so clear. The world is not on track to meet the Paris temperature goals, and the persistence of fossil fuels is a major reason why.",https://images.theconversation.com/files/695477/original/file-20251009-66-1gfhdk.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=531%2C2058%2C4635%2C2317&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,N,,2025-10-16 13:03:57.602997

In a new policy report, Clean Air Task Force (CATF) offers a menu of state policy options —adaptable to states’ energy and economic priorities—to create the conditions needed to attract and deploy future fusion energy projects.

Fusion energy refers to the release of energy from the fusing of two atomic nuclei–the same reaction that powers the Sun. The fusion industry has entered a new era of rapid progress. In the last few years, the number of fusion energy companies worldwide has more than quadrupled, driven by record levels of private capital and breakthroughs in enabling technologies such as industrial scale production of high-temperature super conductors and artificial intelligence. Multiple private developers are now putting forward credible plans to connect fusion energy machines to the power grid by the early 2030s.

States can expect an array of benefits from the deployment of future fusion energy machines. Their production of clean, firm power may enable the replacement of retiring fossil fuel infrastructure and increase generation to meet load growth. Fusion energy machines could also complement intermittent renewable energy resources to lower energy system costs and improve grid reliability. The abundant availability of fusion fuel can enhance energy security by reducing reliance on imported or constrained resources, while the operational profile of fusion energy machines could make them well suited to power data centers. Beyond energy benefits, fusion energy deployment may drive economic growth—spurring job creation across construction, manufacturing, and supply chains—and position early-mover states as leaders in a globally competitive clean energy market.

The current landscape of state fusion energy policy

Although the first commercial fusion energy machine has not yet been connected to the grid, the state policy and regulatory environments of today will determine where companies puts their machines on the grid tomorrow. Over the course of the past year, multiple states took steps to create an enabling policy environment for fusion energy deployment.

Connecticut became the fortieth Agreement State on September 30th “Agreement States” are states with delegated authority from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to regulate most uses of radioactive materials (including fusion energy machines, but also other industrial and medical uses of radioactive materials). Becoming an Agreement State gives a state significantly more control over regulatory readiness and responsiveness than a state that defers radiological licensing authority over fusion energy to the NRC.

Virginia explicitly defined fusion energy in statute, explicitly classifying fusion energy as a “carbon-free” or “clean energy” source. This put fusion alongside solar, wind, hydro, geothermal, and nuclear in the state’s definitions, providing legal clarity for fusion energy projects.

Washington passed legislation allowing fusion energy projects to utilize permitting reforms available to other clean energy sources.

Wisconsin passed legislation to enable a study identifying possible sites in the state for deployment of fusion energy machines.

As more states consider how to position themselves for a fusion energy future, the focus will increasingly turn to aligning existing clean energy policies—such as siting processes, permitting requirements, and electricity procurement standards—to include fusion energy as an eligible technology for support.

State policy options to support fusion energy deployment

While fusion energy is a new energy technology, states do not need to reinvent the wheel to create an effective policy environment for its commercial deployment. In some areas, fusion energy may require tailored policies, but in most cases, the priority will be ensuring that broader state-level clean energy tools apply to fusion energy.

Clean Air Task Force’s new policy brief offers 10 options states can use to support fusion energy deployment:

Strengthen State Regulatory Capacity: States can strengthen their regulatory readiness and responsiveness by becoming Agreement States, and if already Agreement States, by ensuring their respective implementing agency is adequately resourced to effectively engage with fusion energy developers throughout the licensing process for fusion energy machines to allow for an efficient and thorough licensing process based on based on proportional, technology-inclusive, and performance-based principles.

Expedite Permitting: Efficient permitting processes for the eventual commercial deployment of fusion energy machines will reduce uncertainty for fusion energy developers.

Ensure Efficient Siting Processes: States can ease siting processes for fusion energy machines using typical steps used to incentivize other large projects, such as feasibility studies, site certification programs, reduced property taxes, and waived permitting fees. Former fossil fuel sites also present strong opportunities for fusion energy development by offering existing high-capacity grid connections for reuse. States can support such “fusion brightfields” projects with build-ready programs, brownfield remediation incentives, and liability protections.

Clearing Interconnection Queues: States can press for progress at the grid operator level to clear interconnection backlogs so fusion energy machines can deliver power when commercially ready.

Defining Fusion Energy Explicitly in State Statutes: States can define fusion energy in statutes to reduce uncertainty and to clarify which state policies apply to fusion energy. Furthermore, defining fusion energy in state statutes as a clean energy source can further enable fusion energy to benefit from broader clean energy incentives.

Including Fusion Energy in Clean Energy Standards (CES) and Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS): States can adopt or amend electricity standards to qualify fusion energy as an eligible energy source.

Creating Fusion Energy Tax Incentives: Offering targeted or technology-neutral tax credits can de-risk private investment and help to attract and retain fusion energy startups and component manufacturers.

Funding and Financing Tools for Fusion Energy: Ensuring fusion energy developers have access to financing tools to bridge early-stage commercialization gaps may encourage them to site in a state.

Establishing Innovation Hubs and Cultivating a Fusion Energy Workforce: Concentrated “fusion hubs” around universities and national laboratories can foster entrepreneurship, strengthen supply chains, and develop the skilled workforce fusion energy ecosystems will require.

Promoting Public Acceptance: Clear communication of fusion energy’s anticipated benefits and operational safety profile as well as active community engagement will be important to ensure public support for fusion energy deployment.

The road ahead for fusion deployment in states

As fusion energy moves closer to commercial reality, states have a window of opportunity to prepare. Proactive policy design today can help states position themselves to create an effective environment for fusion energy deployment tomorrow.

There is no single policy approach that will work for every state, nor do states need to adopt every option outlined in the brief. Instead, the most effective strategy is to support innovation and engage communities, while selecting the policies that best fit each state’s unique circumstances and energy goals. By doing so, and by engaging early with the fusion industry, electric utilities, developers, and other stakeholders, states can position themselves as leaders in the commercial deployment of fusion energy in the coming years.",https://cdn.catf.us/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/15132901/StatePolicyOptions.jpg,N,,2025-10-16 11:13:36.588925

“We see a missing piece in this orderbook strategy—the absence of nuclear waste disposal,” said Rod Baltzer, CEO of Deep Isolation.
“By embedding disposal into their orderbook strategy, first mover states can reduce financial risk, increase investor confidence, and build public trust that advanced nuclear comes with a complete lifecycle solution.” Baltzer added that Deep Isolation’s deep borehole drilling technology, adapted from the oil and gas industry, along with the company’s disposal canister system, can play a key role in helping states meet its nuclear waste challenges.
“The orderbook approach moves away from one-off demonstrations to propel widespread market adoption by building a robust demand signal for the most viable advanced nuclear technologies,” NASEO said.

Baltzer added that Deep Isolation’s deep borehole drilling technology, adapted from the oil and gas industry, along with the company’s disposal canister system, can play a key role in helping states meet its nuclear waste challenges.

Background: Facilitated by NASEO, Idaho National Laboratory, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, and the Department of Energy’s Gateway for Accelerated Innovation in Nuclear, the Advanced Nuclear First Mover Initiative is being led by state cochairs New York, Indiana, Kentucky, Tennessee, and Wyoming, with participating states Louisiana, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Utah, Virginia, and West Virginia.

According to NASEO, the governors of these states are committed to working with the private sector, the DOE, and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to accelerate advanced nuclear projects and bring more power to the electric grid for reliability, sustainability, and economic growth.

On September 16, NASEO issued a request for information on the initiative to provide the organization and first mover states with information on a potential structure for an advanced nuclear project orderbook strategy, status and use cases for different nuclear technologies, and investment and coordination models.

“The orderbook approach moves away from one-off demonstrations to propel widespread market adoption by building a robust demand signal for the most viable advanced nuclear technologies,” NASEO said.

The deadline for the RFI was recently extended from October 10 to October 17.

Recommendations: Noting that the lack of a safe, permanent waste solution remains one of Americans’ top concerns about nuclear power, Deep Isolation said its recommendations draw on consensus across the advanced reactor industry, as reflected in the U.S. Nuclear Industry Council’s “Action Plan for Transforming the Back End of the U.S. Nuclear Fuel Cycle.”

“Deep Isolation calls on NASEO to integrate USNIC’s recommendations into its orderbook strategy: working collaboratively with communities to accelerating innovative disposal technologies, launching near-term demonstrations, and mobilizing private investment through public-private partnerships and legislative reform,” the company said.

Deep Isolation’s submission highlights three specific calls to action for participating states:

Join the Deep Borehole Demonstration Center, a Cameron, Texas, nonprofit where the company plans to conduct a full-scale nonradioactive deep borehole disposal pilot with initial canister emplacement targeted for 2027.

Support early borehole demonstrations in their states, including via joint initiatives with the DOE at federal laboratories such as INL or ORNL (consistent with President Trump’s Executive Order 14302 to leverage these sites for innovative nuclear demonstrations).

“The food industry’s resilience will depend on how quickly companies adapt to this new reality.”","The 45Z tax credit gives biofuel producers a leg up and risks pushing out the food industry, finds report

Thanks to federal tax credits, biofuel producers will be able to pay farmers at least two times more an acre for crops than most food companies, finds a study by management consultancy Bain & Company — with the potential to disrupt agricultural markets.

The 45Z clean fuel production credit was introduced in 2025 under the Inflation Reduction Act to incentivise the domestic production of low-carbon transport fuels, including sustainable aviation fuel and biomass-based diesel.

While the Donald Trump administration revoked many of the IRA’s key tax credits in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, it extended the 45Z credit, which was set to expire in 2027, to 2029.

There will be “much greater competition” between food and fuel producers, particularly for major crops such as corn and soya, Bain partner Andrew Keech said in a statement.

This is not the first time US federal policy has reshaped agricultural markets, the report notes. Between 2005 and 2012, inflation-adjusted corn prices leapt up by 193 per cent, driven in part by a government mandate to blend gasoline with ethanol.

“Today’s potential biofuels boom may not unfold in the same way, but the strategic risks are familiar,” the report says.

Global demand for biofuels is set to rise exponentially in the coming years as hard-to-abate sectors such as aviation and shipping work to decarbonise.

More pressure on food companies

This comes as food companies are already facing pricing pressures, reduced supply chain resilience, and greater difficulty obtaining key ingredients, the report notes.

As biofuel producers are able to bid more aggressively for farmland acres, food companies could face “higher input prices, reduced access to sustainable ingredients, and challenges in meeting both sustainability commitments and supply chain ambitions”, it says.

Bain estimates that biofuel producers will be able to pay up to $180 an acre thanks to the tax credits. It contrasts that with the $15–$35 an acre food companies typically offer.

In 2025, just 9 per cent of US-grown corn is expected to enter the human food supply, compared with 38 per cent for animal feed, 35 per cent for ethanol production, and 18 per cent for exports, says the report. Eight per cent of US-grown soya will be used for human consumption this year.

Remedies available

Bain recommends that food companies start by mapping their most critical ingredients and where they are sourced from, quantifying how overlaps with biofuel demand could affect their ability to secure a sustainable supply. It also suggests that companies explore sourcing alternatives and develop contingency plans before problems emerge.

“As extreme weather events increase and temperatures rise, supply chain resilience will be mission critical,” says the report. “The food industry’s resilience will depend on how quickly companies adapt to this new reality.”",https://d2iztrg3kgqpue.cloudfront.net/production/c01d6497-e6da-405a-a779-d0a5fad456f0.jpg,N,,2025-10-16 09:00:01.265043

Back in 2021, CEO Mary Barra told CNBC she was “absolutely” convinced that GM would surpass Tesla as EV leader within four years.
By then, Tesla had a 63% market share in the electric segment in the US, while GM represented 10%.
However, it still remains at least three times larger than the combined market share of all General Motors‘ brands.
In the first nine months of 2025, and according to data from Cox Automotive, Tesla held a 43.2% share of the EV market.","General Motors is on track to largely miss its goal of surpassing Tesla in EV market share in the US.

Back in 2021, CEO Mary Barra told CNBC she was “absolutely” convinced that GM would surpass Tesla as EV leader within four years.

By then, Tesla had a 63% market share in the electric segment in the US, while GM represented 10%.

Questioned by reporter Phil LeBeau if the CEO thought they could “catch Tesla by 2025,” Barra said “absolutely.”

In the same interview, the chief executive added that GM would “keep working until we have number one market share in EVs.”

Tesla‘s market share has declined over the past four years, as competition from both legacy automakers entering the segment and new pure EV makers rose.

However, it still remains at least three times larger than the combined market share of all General Motors‘ brands.

In the first nine months of 2025, and according to data from Cox Automotive, Tesla held a 43.2% share of the EV market.

GM, on the other hand, totaled 13.9%, combining Chevrolet‘s 8.3%, Cadillac‘s 3.7% and GMC’s 1.9%.

The Detroit automaker set several ambitious goals when it comes to electric vehicle production in 2021, as CEO Mary Barra targeted GM to be electric-only by 2035.

The company also planned for half of its North American and China factories be capable of making electric vehicles by 2030.

Four years ago, GM announced that it was investing $35 billion on both electric and autonomous vehicles — including battery development, new models and converting its plants to accommodate EV production.

But as of 2025, these plans have been dramatically scaled back and will cost the company $1.6 billion in the third quarter.

General Motors said earlier this week that it expects “the adoption rate of EVs to slow,” following “recent US Government policy changes,” referring to the end of the $7,500 consumer credit on EV purchases and leasing.

In August, the company had already stated that “we will almost certainly see a smaller EV market for a while, and we won’t overproduce.”

Still, GM believes that its brands can “continue to grow EV market share” after the deadline.

In the third quarter, the company delivered a record 66,501 EVs, as demand rose ahead of the credit deadline.

Tesla, on the other hand, delivered an all-time record 497,099 electric vehicles in the July-September period.

Earlier this year, General Motors announced that it was investing $4 billion to expand production of petrol-powered vehicles in several of its US factories.

It included its plants in Orion, Fairfax and Spring Hill — which were all producing electric vehicles.

Telling its employees it would produce internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles as demand was higher, GM halted its plans to produce EVs in Orion,

Last month, Reuters also reported that the company is ending production of two electric Cadillac SUVs in Spring Hill by the end of this year.

According to X user ‘alojoh,’ GM has booked over $7.1 billion in write-offs and restructuring charges in the past twelve months, according to SEC filings.

These include not only the $1.6 billion charges from its EV business slowdown, but also $4 billion for reorganizing its joint venture in China with state-owned SAIC Motor.",https://i0.wp.com/eletric-vehicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GM_Barra.jpeg?fit=1200%2C676&ssl=1,N,,2025-10-16 11:15:47.118237

As Industry Dive notes, this move is seen as a significant reversal and a signal of Stellantis’s renewed commitment to U.S. manufacturing.
The hope is that this new leadership, coupled with the massive U.S. investment, will help turn around the company’s fortunes.
Stellantis’s strategy also includes launching 19 refreshed products across its U.S. manufacturing facilities through 2029, many featuring updated powertrains.
GM, another major U.S. automaker, has also announced similar moves, committing $4 billion earlier this year to expand its own U.S. manufacturing capabilities.","Stellantis, one of the world’s largest automakers, has announced a sweeping $13 billion investment plan to revitalize and expand its manufacturing presence across the United States—a move that stands as the largest single outlay in the company’s 100-year history. The announcement, made on October 15, 2025, marks a pivotal moment for Stellantis as it seeks to boost domestic vehicle production by 50% over the next four years, launch five new vehicles, and create over 5,000 new jobs across key Midwestern states.

According to Automotive News and confirmed by a company press release on October 14, the investment will be distributed among four major manufacturing hubs: Illinois, Ohio, Michigan, and Indiana. The plan includes reopening the once-shuttered Belvidere Assembly Plant in Illinois, launching a new midsize pickup in Ohio, producing a next-generation Dodge Durango in Detroit, and rolling out a new four-cylinder engine in Indiana. The company’s leadership, now under CEO Antonio Filosa, is betting big on a resurgence in the American auto market—and on the enduring appeal of its Jeep, Dodge, and Ram brands.

""This investment in the U.S. — the single largest in the Company’s history — will drive our growth, strengthen our manufacturing footprint and bring more American jobs to the states we call home,"" said Filosa in a statement reported by Industry Dive. He emphasized that accelerating growth in the U.S. has been a top priority since his first day as CEO. ""Success in America is not just good for Stellantis in the U.S.—it makes us stronger everywhere,"" Filosa added.

The centerpiece of the initiative is the $600 million reopening of the Belvidere Assembly Plant in Illinois, which Stellantis had closed in February 2023 as part of a cost-cutting effort. Now, the plant is poised for a comeback, with plans to expand production of the Jeep Cherokee and Jeep Compass SUVs for the U.S. market. The facility is expected to create roughly 3,300 jobs and begin producing vehicles in 2027. As Industry Dive notes, this move is seen as a significant reversal and a signal of Stellantis’s renewed commitment to U.S. manufacturing.

Meanwhile, in Ohio, Stellantis will invest $400 million into its Toledo Assembly Complex to build an all-new midsize pickup. Production is scheduled to start in 2028 and is expected to add about 900 jobs. The Ohio plant will continue to produce the Jeep Wrangler and Gladiator, two of the company’s most iconic models.

Michigan is also set to benefit from the investment. Stellantis plans to pour $100 million into its Warren Truck Assembly Plant to produce an all-new range-extended electric vehicle (EV) and a new full-size SUV with an internal combustion engine. Production at this plant is expected to start in 2028. The Warren facility currently manufactures the Jeep Wagoneer and Grand Wagoneer, and Stellantis recently unveiled the redesigned 2026 Grand Wagoneer, which will be offered with two powertrain options: a range-extended version and a 3.0-liter Hurricane twin-turbo engine.

Detroit’s Assembly Complex will see $130 million invested to prepare for the next-generation Dodge Durango SUV, with production targeted to begin in 2029. Over in Indiana, the Kokomo plant will start producing the all-new four-cylinder GMET4 EVO engine in 2026, backed by an investment of over $100 million and expected to add more than 100 jobs.

Unlike many recent auto industry investments, Stellantis’s plan is not focused primarily on electrification. Only one of the five new vehicles will be a range-extended EV, with the rest being traditional or hybrid internal combustion models. This approach reflects a strategic decision to balance consumer demand for both electric and gasoline-powered vehicles, especially as the U.S. market remains divided on the pace of EV adoption.

Stellantis’s investment comes at a time of significant transition and challenge for the company. After years of declining sales and profits in North America and Europe, the automaker is working to regain its footing. In July 2025, Stellantis reported that its first-half revenues had fallen 13% compared to the previous year, resulting in an operating loss of 2.3 billion euros. Net revenue for the first six months of 2025 dropped to 74.3 billion euros, which Stellantis attributed mainly to sales declines and a loss of market share.

The shakeup at the top was swift. Antonio Filosa, who took over as CEO on June 23, 2025, after the resignation of Carlos Tavares in December 2024, quickly announced a new leadership team. According to Industry Dive, Filosa described his new executive team as individuals who ""bring an entrepreneurial spirit and profound understanding of the company’s brands."" The hope is that this new leadership, coupled with the massive U.S. investment, will help turn around the company’s fortunes.

Stellantis currently operates 34 manufacturing facilities, distribution centers, and research and development sites in the U.S., supporting more than 48,000 employees. The new investment is expected to add over 5,000 jobs, a significant boost for communities across the Midwest. The reopening of the Belvidere plant alone is projected to have a major economic impact on the region, which has faced job losses and uncertainty since the facility’s closure.

The timing of Stellantis’s move is not accidental. The announcement follows the imposition of tariffs that have made importing vehicles from regions like Mexico, Canada, and Europe—where Stellantis also operates—considerably more expensive. There is also political pressure: former President Donald Trump has repeatedly called for more auto manufacturing to return to the U.S., and the current economic climate has made domestic investment more attractive for global automakers.

Investors responded positively to the news. Stellantis stock climbed more than 5% in after-hours trading following the announcement, and shares continued to trade about 1% higher in midday trading the next day, as reported by Automotive News.

Stellantis’s strategy also includes launching 19 refreshed products across its U.S. manufacturing facilities through 2029, many featuring updated powertrains. ""As we begin our next 100 years, we are putting the customer at the center of our strategy, expanding our vehicle offerings and giving them the freedom to choose the products they want and love,"" Filosa said, underscoring the company’s focus on consumer choice and flexibility.

GM, another major U.S. automaker, has also announced similar moves, committing $4 billion earlier this year to expand its own U.S. manufacturing capabilities. This trend signals a broader industry shift toward strengthening domestic production in response to global supply chain disruptions, shifting consumer preferences, and evolving trade policies.

With this historic investment, Stellantis is betting that a renewed focus on American manufacturing, a diversified vehicle lineup, and a fresh leadership approach will help it reclaim lost ground in the fiercely competitive U.S. auto market. The coming years will reveal whether this bold gamble pays off, but for now, the company’s commitment to American jobs and innovation is clear.",https://thumbor.evrimagaci.org/caXXdBscfJr1XzA7vMVP-AnxCyg=/1200x0/filters:format(webp)/tpg%2Fsources%2F1b2cff87-c163-4802-afe3-7387e390a04d.jpeg,N,,2025-10-16 11:17:43.453162

Blame Congress - The Fulcrum,"Jonah Goldberg, www.facebook.com",,,,,https://thefulcrum.us/democracy/executive-overreach-in-america,"Informal workers’ work conditions are generally considered precarious as they are exposed to unique physical, social, and environmental hazards.
Workers typically engage in informal work because formal work is not often available due to citizenship status, language, ability, or related contextual factors.
Little is known about the impacts of the work conditions of these informal workers on their health.
Dr. Jeni Hebert-Beirne is a Professor of Community Health Sciences at the University of Illinois Chicago (UIC) School of Public Health and is Public Voices fellow of The OpEd.
The pattern is the same: when selfishness is unconstrained, private wealth bends public institutions toward private ends.","Recently, ICE used tear gas, shot pepper spray bullets and flash bang grenades, and arrested protestors outside the ICE facility in Broadview, just outside of Chicago. On the second day of protests, my husband and I, who have lived in Chicago for 35 years, joined the protesters who gathered.

Witnessing van after van pulling into the Broadview facility with heavily armed and fully masked ICE workers pulling out of the van, young men, teens, and older adults was frightening.

This action came slightly more than a week after ICE agents in Franklin Park, a Chicago suburb, killed a restaurant worker and father of two, Silverio Villegas-Gonzales, who had no criminal record, after a vehicle stop.

The scale of these attacks risks erasure of a profoundly important cultural presence. Contrary to the promise to rid the country of what President Donald Trump calls the “worst of the worst,” including drug dealers, murderers, and rapists, this is an attack on vulnerable workers who have migrated for work to advance their own and their families’ futures and find themselves in informal work situations.

As a public health professor and community-based participatory researcher, for more than a decade, I have explored community-led solutions to occupational health concerns in Chicago neighborhoods with high proportions of informal workers.

Their work is outside of formal employment structures with standardized pay and worker protections. Informal workers’ work conditions are generally considered precarious as they are exposed to unique physical, social, and environmental hazards. Workers typically engage in informal work because formal work is not often available due to citizenship status, language, ability, or related contextual factors.

People migrate for work as pay allows for basic needs to be met. It is a protected human right to seek safety, refuge, and the opportunity to work.

Informal workers often engage in work outside, in public spaces. They are exposed to unsafe environmental conditions, police and public harassment, and lack standard work conditions, such as access to a bathroom.

Well-recognized in their urban neighborhoods, these workers include street food vendors selling tamales, shaved ice, and nopales, and day laborers who stand in the parking lots of Home Depot or Menards, waiting for a work opportunity.

In order to make a living for themselves and their families (much of their pay is sent to family members in their country of origin), day laborers get into cars or vans, not knowing where they are being taken, what the work will be, if they will get paid, and when they will return.

The work is often extremely precarious and hazardous, and there is a high rate of exploitation in which day laborers engage in work that goes unpaid, knowing they have no recourse.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recognize work as a social determinant of health. Work typically impacts health through three pathways: hazardous working conditions (physical, chemical, biologic, and psychosocial), work-stressors, and risks to material deprivation (income, wealth, housing, or neighborhood hardship).

Little is known about the impacts of the work conditions of these informal workers on their health. However, our research found that among a sample of precariously employed workers in a neighborhood, those in the highest precarity category were Latinx and born outside the United States.

The research found that the most employment precarity experienced is significantly associated with self-reported exposure to chemical and biological hazards, physical hazards, and slip, trip, strike, fall, trap, or crush hazards at work.

To be sure, undocumented immigrants face social and economic challenges in the United States. However, undocumented immigrant workers such as street vendors and day laborers play a critical role in the day-to-day lives of neighborhoods.

Street vendors are often up by 3 a.m. and on the street by 4 a.m. to provide breakfast (tamales) for their neighbor workers headed to factory work. They are still on the street when these workers head home for dinner, more than 12 hours later.

They anticipate their customers and have their orders prepared in advance. They are a constant presence in their communities, serving as the neighborhood’s eyes and ears, assuring students get safely to and from school. Their false criminalization and the violent extraction of their lives from the fabric of our communities will have lasting harm.

Undocumented immigrants contribute to the economy as they pay taxes. In Illinois alone, in 2022, undocumented immigrants paid an estimated $1.55 billion in federal, state, and local taxes, according to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy.

This past month, many informal workers have been unable to work, given the administration’s attack on immigrants. These workers work hand to mouth. A workday lost impacts the family concretely—a loss of food for family meals, not being able to afford school supplies, and/or a risk of loss of housing.

Research has shown that immigrants, including undocumented immigrants, are less likely than those born in the U.S. to commit violent crime. Waves of higher immigration have not seen increases in crime rates but rather reduced crime rates.

The tragic shooting recently at an ICE facility by a sniper in Dallas, killing two detainees, is being blamed by the administration on “rhetoric” opposing ICE. These acts, plus amped up immigration raids across the country, contribute to heightened fear and uncertainty.

Neighborhoods across the country are under attack. Those who support this vicious assault on communities have been misguided. Immigrants are core to the American story. This is an assault on the fabric of our communities.

Adams distinguished between subjects and citizens. Subjects were ruled. Citizens participated. But citizenship required more than casting a vote. It demanded habits that sustain a free society: honesty, moderation, service, and fairness. A republic cannot rest on the hope that enough citizens will voluntarily restrain themselves. History shows that when virtue fails, only clear rules—laws that promote fairness and institutions that protect the public good—can prevent private power from overwhelming democracy itself. Without these guardrails, inequality grows unchecked, cynicism deepens, and democracy itself becomes vulnerable to collapse.

That lesson feels urgent in an age when material success is celebrated as the highest good. Wealth today buys more than comfort—it buys political influence and cultural authority. Since Citizens United v. FEC in 2010, billionaire political spending has exploded. In 2024, just 100 families spent $2.6 billion on elections—more than millions of small donors combined. Pharmaceutical companies spend millions to block reforms that would make medicine affordable. Tech companies lobby against rules designed to keep markets fair. Defense contractors protect massive budgets, even for weapons the military no longer wants. The pattern is the same: when selfishness is unconstrained, private wealth bends public institutions toward private ends.

Adams foresaw this danger. In his 1776 letter to Warren, he warned that “the spirit of commerce…is incompatible with that purity of heart, and greatness of soul which is necessary for a happy Republic.” He did not reject commerce. He saw its energy as essential. But he feared what happens when wealth becomes the only measure of worth and when no boundary—internal or external—checks its pursuit.

The problem, then, is not wealth itself. It is selfishness without limits. Private virtue can restrain it, but when virtue fails, public rules must step in. A healthy republic cannot depend on individual moderation alone. It needs laws that channel economic energy toward the common good: rules that protect fair competition, transparency that exposes corruption, and institutions that reward service over greed.

As I explored in “American Whiplash: A Republic in Cycles”, the United States has repeatedly gone through periods of excess followed by correction. The Progressive Era curbed monopolies. The New Deal built protections in the midst of a crisis. The Civil Rights Movement expanded freedom by forcing the nation to honor its promise of equality. In each case, selfishness was constrained by citizens insisting on fairness and leaders willing to act.

The question now is whether we still have the will to repeat that work. A republic cannot survive if selfishness is allowed to rule unchecked. Adams’s warning was plain: liberty itself will wither when wealth is prized over character. Some may grow very rich, but few will remain free. The true test of the republic is whether it can summon both private virtue and public courage to place the common good above private gain.

The canceled $464 million federal award would have helped pay for the $1.8 billion cost of building power lines to connect two regional grids spanning much of middle America — a project meant to move wind power across state lines and eliminate bottlenecks that are contributing to rising electricity prices.

Seen through the lens of President Donald Trump’s priorities, the power lines would appear to be just the kind of federally backed conduits for wind power that he and his closest advisers abhor. Seen through another lens, the canceled DOE grant threatens a grid expansion that should fit squarely inside the White House’s “energy dominance” agenda, grid officials say — bolstering infrastructure to move more electrons from all sources onto U.S. power grids.

The decision to kill funding for the Minnesota-based effort to build the power lines comes after DOE in July stripped another giant electricity project of federal financial support: a $4.9 billion loan guarantee for the Grain Belt Express, a 780-mile, extra-high-voltage line that would bring massive amounts of wind power from Kansas to the eastern grid, PJM.

In Minnesota, a planning process called the Joint Targeted Interconnection Queue is conceived as a first-of-a-kind partnership between two big regional grid operators: Midcontinent Independent System Operator and Southwest Power Pool. MISO runs the high-voltage grid in all or parts of 15 states from Minnesota to Louisiana, and SPP flanks MISO’s western border and delivers power from the Dakotas to Texas.

Rather than investing in one or two supersized transmission projects, JTIQ planners pinpointed choke points that restrict power flows along the two systems’ common boundary and leave both grids less secure. The DOE grant would have shifted some of the upfront investment in new transmission to federal taxpayers.

“Without these investments, Minnesota could face higher energy prices, slower infrastructure development, and increased burdens on low- and middle-income households — all while demand for clean, affordable energy continues to grow,” the Minnesota Department of Commerce protested after the White House lumped the grant cancellation in with $8 billion in cuts announced on Oct. 1.

At the project’s beginning in 2020, planners assumed that wind and solar power would be the main beneficiaries of greater transmission capacity, documents show. It was primarily clean energy projects that were requesting entry onto regional grids, and the most expansive scenario envisioned the doubling of wind and solar output in the central U.S.

So far, it’s unclear whether the funding reversal puts the entire project at risk.

There is no public analysis from DOE explaining why this grant and more than 300 others on DOE’s list were killed, except for the broad-brush denunciations this month from DOE Secretary Chris Wright and Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought.

“Nearly $8 billion in Green New Scam funding to fuel the Left’s climate agenda is being cancelled,” Vought celebrated on X.

Wright concluded in a statement that the canceled projects “were not economically viable and would not provide a positive return on investment.” House Democrats, noting that projects in blue states had been singled out, shot back, “That is a pretext for cancellations that track political talking points, not facts.”

In May, Wright released a memorandum outlining DOE’s criteria for reviewing projects.

The canceled DOE projects, and those on a longer DOE target list not confirmed by the department with $23 billion in awards tentatively listed as “terminated,” stand as a test of how the Trump administration will address unprecedented pressures that are mounting on the nation’s aging, stressed power systems.

‘Flowing across the seams’

Meanwhile, the need for the projects linking the regional grids and their value to consumers continue to grow, according to a pair of voluminous analyses, one the DOE Transmission Needs study in 2023 and the other by the grid’s security monitor, the North American Electric Reliability Corp.

As the JTIQ plan was being prepared, in 2021 and 2022, two huge Arctic storms swept through the Midwest. Winter Storm Uri paralyzed large parts of Texas and caused billions of dollars in windfall energy charges. Winter Storm Elliott triggered rolling blackouts in the Carolinas and the Tennessee Valley Authority.

Stronger links between MISO and SPP would have permitted more power to flow in these emergencies, contributing to a network that was “bigger than the weather,” as grid planners are urging.

In extreme weather onslaughts, scarce power supplies have caused spot electricity prices to erupt from hundreds of dollars per megawatt-hour to thousands of dollars, according to the 2023 DOE Needs study.

Grid Strategies, a research firm supporting transmission expansion, estimated that every dollar invested in stronger ties between MISO and SPP would pay $7-10 in benefits in weather emergencies, primarily by reducing overcrowding on lines that produce price surges.

“Consumers in the Great Plains [in SPP], and those in the Gulf Coast states [in MISO], each could have saved in excess of $100 million with an additional 1 GW of transmission ties,” Grid Strategies estimated.

Now, the surge in development of artificial intelligence data centers — a top Trump priority — is adding even more urgency to grid expansion.

By 2031, when the JTIQ projects are scheduled to come online, the biggest need for grid capacity in the central U.S. may come from data centers.

Strengthening transmission capacity along the MISO-SPP seam supports the connection of all types of new generators, and all new power users, whether data centers, factories or shale oil production, said Michael Goggin, executive vice president of Grid Strategies, in an interview.

“Generation from all energy sources flows across that seam, and all benefit from reduced congestion,” Goggin said.

Wrench in the innovation pipeline

Some grant recipients say they will challenge DOE actions. Others promise to go on even without DOE.

The Solar and Storage Industries Institute, the research and education unit of the Solar Energy Industries Association, noted in a statement that two of the institute’s grants are on the longer list of targeted projects. Both aim to increase public understanding and engagement in new power project development.

“While it is unclear if these proposed cancellations are final, there is no doubt that in cancelling grants like these, the administration would make it harder to build the energy infrastructure Americans rely on,” Institute Executive Director David Gahl said. “We will use every tool in our toolbox to defend them.”

California was a major target in the first $8 billion in cancellations.

For example, the Imperial Irrigation District has delivered hydropower electricity to people in Southern California for nearly a century. It was in line for a $18.3 million grant, which it would match, to install a system to help streamline operation, speed outage recovery, and aid in connecting renewable energy. It would directly aid disadvantaged, “economically challenged” communities in its region, potentially raising a red flag for Trump administration officials scrutinizing federal projects that benefit “woke” inclusion agendas.

“While we are appealing this, we remain focused on moving forward with the project,” said Imperial Irrigation District spokesperson Robert Schettler. “Since we won’t have the full $36.7 million that was planned for this project, we are seeing what we can trim from the original plan so that we can continue to make headway.”

Two companies on DOE’s longer list, Ascend Elements and American Battery Technology Co., also declared they will go ahead.

American Battery Technology Co. said in a filing Wednesday with the Securities and Exchange Commission that it is appealing an Oct. 9 DOE decision to terminate a $57 million grant to build a plant to manufacture lithium hydroxide for batteries. The company declined to comment, but said in the filing it would move forward with the project “regardless of the outcome of the appeal process,” noting it has raised $52 million in public markets.

The company’s stock fell sharply in after-hours trading after the filing

Ascend received two DOE grants totaling $480 million in 2022 funded by the Infrastructure and Investment Jobs Act, to manufacture components for lithium-ion batteries from recycled electric vehicle batteries at a planned $1 billion plant in Hopkinsville, Kentucky. The battery components would compete with supply that now comes primarily from China, the company said.

After Trump’s DOE took office, the company agreed with DOE to suspend the smaller, $164 million grant for one of its patented battery component products, because of “changing market conditions.”

According to the company, $206 million of the grant had already been disbursed, so the cancellation was essentially on the remaining $110 million.

DOE’s action “doesn’t change our trajectory,” Ascend Elements CEO Linh Austin said in a statement. “We will replace the terminated grant,” with private capital and investments by European partners, he added.

In a statement, DOE spokesperson Ben Dietderich said “no determinations have been made other than what has been previously announced. As Secretary Wright made clear, the Department continues to conduct an individualized and thorough review of financial awards made by the previous administration.”

If Ascend Elements’ plant opens in 2026, it would culminate development of a patented lithium recycling process that was conceived 14 years ago by scientists at Worcester Polytechnic Institute, a private Massachusetts research institute.

An unaddressed issue in the DOE cutback is the impact on the nation’s innovation pipeline that is deeply rooted in academic research centers, the path Ascend Elements followed.

University research was a primary target on the list of $23 billion DOE awards tentatively ticketed for termination. More than 70 colleges, universities and academic research institutes would lose $3 billion in DOE grants if the actions on the large termination list become final.

Speaking ‘Trump’

Some other recipients notified of canceled grants declined to comment on next steps, which could include filing an appeal with DOE, going to court, going on alone, or giving up.

The Electric Power Research Institute, the grid sector’s leading independent non-profit R&D organization, has 11 grants totaling $64 million on the large list, but EPRI’s spokesman said it was not commenting on DOE’s action.

Some companies that are trying to keep their DOE grants or get new ones have begun emphasizing Trump’s priorities in their pitches to the administration, according to people familiar with the process who were granted anonymity to discuss it.

In this dialogue, Trump is an audience of one, and his likes and dislikes rule, these sources say.

A possible example of alignment with Trump’s agenda comes from Avangrid, based in Orange, Connecticut. It is subsidiary of Spain’s multinational energy provider the Iberdrola Group, whose development of wind farms launched more two decades-plus of investment energy infrastructure. It operates in 23 U.S. states.

One of Avangrid’s major U.S. projects is a proposed power line in Maine that would connect 1,200 MW of renewable energy to the New England grid. The Biden administration’s DOE promised to purchase a key part of the power flowing through the future line, to a maximum of $425 million, through its Transmission Facilitation Program.

DOE is authorized to make such purchase commitments as an “anchor tenant” to give big competitive transmission projects more market credibility. DOE could resell any power it wound up with, but by the time the lines were built, all the capacity was expected to be purchased by utilities or customers, removing any financial commitment from DOE, planners predicted.

Avangrid’s purchase commitment is not on the DOE target list.

Although it still points out its clean energy investments, its statements this year herald support for data centers, aligning itself with Trump’s agenda.

Announcing the construction start of a solar project in northeast Oregon last month, the company noted it will help power a new data center “to support Meta’s operations.”",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/52/60/e6db85e2475dbcda9d7b9272a684/climate-wind-energy-40490.jpg,N,,2025-10-16 10:07:10.673985

As U.S. electricity demand is projected to rise more than 40% by 2040 — driven by AI, advanced manufacturing, and population growth — meeting rising demand will depend on the ability to build modern infrastructure.

“We’ve seen it time and time again. Pipelines canceled as a consequence of them no longer being economic because we can’t get them built in a timely manner,” Sommers said. “This is becoming a jobs issue. It’s becoming an economic issue. It’s becoming a consumer issue. And I believe that ultimately, it is about to become a political imperative.”

Through API’s America Builds, America Wins campaign, Sommers outlined concrete steps to unlock the next chapter of energy progress: set deadlines and enforce them; stop lawsuits and start building; and ensure targeted reviews and swift decisions.

“The United States can continue to be the largest oil, gas, and by the way, renewable energy producer in the world and win the race for the future because everything starts with energy,” Sommers said. “And we know that if America builds, America wins.”",https://fuelsmarketnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/API-1200-1200x540-1.png,N,,2025-10-16 08:00:15.220295

Barra also called for a National Zero Emission Vehicle program to help electrify the entire U.S. auto fleet.
The EV push was supercharged during the Biden administration, which introduced tough new emissions standards designed to boost EV sales alongside the EV purchasing tax credit.
In its latest filing, GM said the review of its future EV output is “ongoing” and signaled additional charges could be announced in future quarters.
The entire U.S. auto market also remains challenged by affordability issues.","U.S. automakers are trimming their outlook for electric vehicles amid lingering consumer doubts, a pullback in federal support and a challenging economic landscape that is affecting all auto sales.

On Tuesday, General Motors reported it was taking losses totaling $1.6 billion related to planned changes to its EV rollout. The company attributed some of the change to President Donald Trump’s elimination of the $7,500 in EV purchasing incentives enacted by President Joe Biden. The credit officially expired Sept. 30.

“Following recent U.S. government policy changes, including the termination of certain consumer tax incentives for EV purchases and the reduction in the stringency of emissions regulations, we expect the adoption rate of EVs to slow,” GM said in a filing.

Rival Ford has delayed plans to build out an EV plant in Tennessee. It told Reuters last week it would be “nimble in adjusting our product launch timing to meet market needs and customer demand while targeting improved profitability.”

Plunging sales at Tesla — still the U.S. leader in EV sales — are also contributing to the weakening outlook. Its second-quarter sales dropped almost 13%, and CEO Elon Musk has warned of some “rough quarters” ahead for the company.

The changes threaten to leave the United States behind in what many still consider the future of automobiles. In July 2024, EV sales officially overtook sales of conventional autos in China. There and in nearby countries, the cost of an electric vehicle has been falling more rapidly than in the United States, thanks largely to increased competition from the Chinese manufacturers that now dominate the global EV market. However, other Western countries are also rethinking previous EV commitments, including Canada and the United Kingdom, both of which have signaled relaxing electrification targets, partly in response to new pressures sparked by Trump’s trade war.

The retreats are a turnabout from the heady ambitions for EVs that U.S. automakers signaled less than a decade ago. The highest-profile push came from General Motors CEO Mary Barra, who committed the storied automaker to a “zero emissions” future in 2017.

“No more gas. No more diesel. No more carbon emissions,” she wrote at the time.

But a series of challenges — cost concerns, sluggish adoption and the reversal in support in Washington — has left the U.S. auto industry with greater uncertainty about its EV future.

“Penetration has stalled,” said David Whiston, a senior analyst at Morningstar investment research company who covers autos.

Even before Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” ended the tax credit, signs of resistance to EVs among U.S. consumers had begun to show. A survey published in August 2024 by Edmunds automotive information group showed concerns about finding charging stations and charging times, availability and reliability as the top reasons consumers would not purchase EVs.

“They said they don’t want the hassle or don’t feel like learning something new,” said Jessica Caldwell, head of insights at Edmunds.

In the second quarter of 2025, new EV sales declined by 6.3% year on year, according to Cox Automotive, which said the growth trajectory for EVs “has been curbed.” EV sales got a boost in the third quarter, but analysts said that was most likely the result of the looming expiration of the tax credit.

“The federal tax credit was a key catalyst for EV adoption, and its expiration marks a pivotal moment,” Cox Automotive’s director of industry insights, Stephanie Valdez Streaty, said in a release. “This shift will test whether the electric vehicle market is mature enough to thrive on its own fundamentals or still needs support to expand further.”

For a time, EVs seemed poised to take over the U.S. market. Following the lead of Barra of GM, Ford announced in 2018 that it planned to nearly triple its investments in electric and hybrid vehicles by 2022, with plans for 40 new such models. Barra also called for a National Zero Emission Vehicle program to help electrify the entire U.S. auto fleet.

Meanwhile, sales at Tesla, which exclusively manufactures EVs, began to accelerate, turning the groundbreaking automaker into one of the most valuable companies in the world and giving it a dominant position in the electric market.

The EV push was supercharged during the Biden administration, which introduced tough new emissions standards designed to boost EV sales alongside the EV purchasing tax credit.

But last year, Barra told NBC News that GM’s all-electric future would now play out “over decades,” though the company said it continued to target 2035 to fully electrify its fleet. In its latest filing, GM said the review of its future EV output is “ongoing” and signaled additional charges could be announced in future quarters. A GM spokesman did not respond to a request for comment.

Last month, The Wall Street Journal reported that GM had spent more to lobby the federal government in 2025 to fight clean air and fuel economy rules than any company other than Facebook parent Meta.

“What we’re committed to is the customer,” Barra said about the shift away from EVs at a Wall Street Journal event in May, the paper reported. “The customer was telling us they weren’t ready.”

Ford CEO Jim Farley said this month that EV sales could fall by around 50% after the EV tax credits expire. A Ford spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.

The entire U.S. auto market also remains challenged by affordability issues. The average price of a new car surpassed $50,000 for the first time last month, Kelley Blue Book reported Tuesday. The average monthly auto payment in the United States is now $749 for new vehicles and $529 for used vehicles, according to the credit reporting agency Experian. U.S. households in general continue to struggle with stubborn inflation and an increasingly shaky jobs market, which has left the pace of overall monthly auto sales below pre-pandemic levels.

EVs currently cost about $7,000 more, according to Kelley Blue Book data.

Anna Vanderspek, electric vehicle program director at the Green Energy Consumers Alliance, an environmental advocacy group, said she is hopeful that the global shift toward EVs will eventually rebound to U.S. automakers as they look to stay competitive and thus filter down to U.S. consumers.

But she acknowledged the timetable for adoption has shifted.

“There’s good reason to think that this transition will continue to happen,” she said. “But now it will just happen more slowly.”","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-10/251014-Taicang-port-in-Suzhou-china-BYD-evs-other-brands-ready-for-export-ac-1053p-20a043.jpg",N,,2025-10-16 07:59:33.336734

Global energy intensity improved by just 1% in 2024, far below the 4% annual gains needed to meet the UAE Consensus goal and keep the 1.5°C target alive.

The report calls for urgent action to:

• integrate renewable targets into national climate plans (NDC 3.0) ahead of COP30 in Belém;

• double collective NDC ambition to align with the global renewables goal; and

• scale investment in renewables to at least USD 1.4 trillion per year in 2025–2030 –- more than doubling the USD 624 billion invested in 2024.

In light of the report findings, United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres said: “The clean energy revolution is unstoppable. Renewables are deployed faster and cheaper than fossil fuels – driving growth, jobs, and affordable power. But the window to keep the 1.5°C limit within reach is rapidly closing. We must step up, scale up and speed up the just energy transition – for everyone, everywhere.”

Francesco La Camera, Director-General of IRENA added: “The world has broken renewable capacity records, but records alone will not keep 1.5°C alive. Renewables are not just the most cost-effective climate solution; they are the biggest economic opportunity of our time. This report shows the path: accelerate deployment, modernise grids, scale clean-tech and strengthen supply chains. Every dollar invested brings growth, jobs and energy security. As the custodian agency tracking progress toward the global renewables goal, we call for greater ambition. By raising targets, mobilising finance and deepening cooperation, major economies can lead the energy transition and make COP30 a milestone.”

Ben Backwell, Chair of the Global Renewables Alliance, said: “The private sector is driving the energy transition, providing three-quarters of global clean energy investment. Our industries, led by wind, solar and hydropower, are already delivering growth, jobs and security. What we need now are long-term government plans that match national ambitions; we need pipelines that deliver projects. Plans must deliver enabling action on grids and storage and help maximise the benefits of the energy transition. This report shows that the march to renewable energy abundance is underway – and it’s time for us to accelerate.”

The world’s major advanced and emerging economies must take the lead, according to the recommendations of the new report. G20 nations are projected to account for over 80% of global renewables by 2030, with the richest developed economies of the G7 expected to shoulder a leadership role by raising their share to around 20% of global capacity within this decade.

Major global economies must also deliver on climate finance, meeting the USD 300 billion annual floor of the new collective quantified goal (NCQG) and scaling up towards the aspirational USD 1.3 trillion confirmed at COP29 in Azerbaijan.

Beyond renewables, the report underlines the urgent need for investment in grids, supply chains, and clean-tech manufacturing for solar, wind, batteries and hydrogen.

While renewable energy investments grew by 7% in 2024, actual disbursements remain far below the levels required to build robust project pipelines and accelerate construction. As to supply chains, fair and transparent trade practices must be ensured for critical renewable energy technologies and international co-operation pursued to safeguard trade corridors for key materials and components.

Furthermore, strategic investment in modernising and expanding electricity grids is the essential foundation for integrating new capacity and strengthening energy security. Between now and 2030, an estimated USD 670 billion must be directed each year towards grids, with further investment required to rapidly scale up energy storage solutions, facilitate renewable integration and safeguard grid stability.",https://strategicenergy.eu/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/PPAs-are-transforming-the-renewable-energy-sector-in-Portugal.png,N,,2025-10-16 11:13:46.603713

The new plants and product launches position the company to better compete with Tesla, GM, Ford, and BYD in the growing U.S. EV market.","Stellantis, the world’s third-largest automaker, is accelerating its electric vehicle (EV) transformation in the United States with a record-breaking $13 billion investment.

The initiative marks the company’s largest-ever commitment in its 100-year U.S. history and strengthens its position in the race toward electrification and sustainable mobility. Here are 10 key facts about the investment and what it means for the EV market, jobs, and U.S. manufacturing.

Antonio Filosa, Stellantis CEO and North America COO, said: “As we begin our next 100 years, we are putting the customer at the center of our strategy, expanding our vehicle offerings and giving them the freedom to choose the products they want and love.”

1. Stellantis Commits $13 Billion Over Four Years

Stellantis will invest $13 billion between 2025 and 2029 to expand its U.S. operations, focusing on electric and hybrid vehicle production, new powertrains, and advanced manufacturing capabilities. This is the company’s biggest U.S. investment ever.

2. Focus on Electric and Hybrid Vehicles

A significant portion of the investment targets EV and range-extended hybrid vehicle development. Stellantis plans to launch an all-new range-extended electric SUV at the Warren Truck Assembly Plant in Michigan by 2028—reinforcing its EV roadmap under the Dare Forward 2030 strategy.

3. Five New Models for the U.S. Market

The company will roll out five brand-new models across Jeep, Dodge, and other Stellantis brands. These models will include next-generation EVs and electrified SUVs designed to compete in high-demand American segments.

4. 5,000 New Jobs Across Four States

The investment will create over 5,000 new jobs in Illinois, Ohio, Michigan, and Indiana, strengthening Stellantis’ manufacturing footprint and supporting local economies tied to the clean mobility transition.

5. Illinois Plant to Produce Electric Jeeps

Stellantis will reopen the Belvidere Assembly Plant in Illinois with a $600 million investment to produce Jeep Cherokee and Jeep Compass models, expected to include electric and hybrid variants. The reopening will create around 3,300 jobs and revive a key facility that was shuttered in 2023.

6. Michigan to Host a New Range-Extended EV SUV

In Michigan, the automaker will retool its Warren Truck Assembly Plant with nearly $100 million to produce a large range-extended electric SUV starting in 2028—adding about 900 jobs. This underscores Stellantis’ commitment to electrified SUVs, one of the fastest-growing automotive categories.

7. Indiana to Build the New Four-Cylinder EV-Capable Engine

Indiana will produce the GMET4 EVO, a next-generation four-cylinder engine optimized for both traditional and electrified powertrains. This $100 million investment ensures the U.S. remains a key base for Stellantis’ future hybrid and EV components.

8. Toledo to Build a New Midsize Truck

In Ohio, Stellantis will invest $400 million to produce a new midsize truck, possibly featuring electrified variants, at the Toledo Assembly Complex, where the Jeep Wrangler 4xe (a leading plug-in hybrid SUV) is already manufactured.

9. Strategic Move Amid U.S. Tariffs

The investment may also serve to mitigate the impact of U.S. tariffs on imported vehicles. By localizing EV and hybrid production, Stellantis can reduce costs and maintain competitiveness in its critical North American market.

10. Strengthening Stellantis’ EV Strategy in the U.S.

This expansion supports Stellantis’ Dare Forward 2030 vision, which targets 50 percent EV sales in North America by 2030. The new plants and product launches position the company to better compete with Tesla, GM, Ford, and BYD in the growing U.S. EV market.

Earlier, Stellantis announced that it is accelerating its transition to electric mobility through its “Dare Forward 2030” strategy. The company targets 100 percent battery-electric sales in Europe and 50 percent in the U.S. by 2030, with plans to launch 75 BEV models across brands such as Jeep, Fiat, Peugeot, and Dodge. It aims to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2038.

To support this shift, Stellantis is investing over €30 billion by 2025 in electrification and software development. Its expanding EV lineup includes the Jeep Recon, Wagoneer S, Fiat 500e, Peugeot e-208, and Ram 1500 REV. The company is also establishing five gigafactories in Europe and North America to secure battery supply for its growing range of electric vehicles.",https://greentechlead.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Stellantis-EV-Michigan-facility.jpg,N,,2025-10-16 11:17:49.677378

Cybertruck was well on its way to flop status before these sales numbers.
Still, the vehicle’s third-quarter performance is particularly damning in comparison to nationwide EV sales, where the tax credit’s demise ignited a fire sale.
Those two vehicles remained the two best-selling EVs in America, with Tesla selling more than 114,000 Model Ys and more than 53,000 Model 3s.
Now that Cybertruck has become Elon’s Edsel, Tesla’s hopes for an EV sales revival lie largely with the new “Standard” versions of its two best-sellers.","Americans certainly got the message about the end of the EV tax credit. With the $7,500 benefit set to disappear at the end of September, electric vehicle sales surged to record numbers in the third quarter of 2025 as buyers raced to beat the deadline.

The rising tide lifted just about all EVs — but not the struggling Tesla Cybertruck. According to new numbers from Kelley Blue Book, Tesla sold just 5,385 Cybertrucks from July to September, less than half as many as it delivered during the same period in 2024. The company is now expected to sell around 20,000 of the metal EVs this calendar year. That’s down from around 50,000 last year, and less than 10% of the 250,000 total Elon Musk once predicted as the truck’s annual sales figure.

Cybertruck was well on its way to flop status before these sales numbers. With its purposefully jarring aesthetic, the EV for edgelords was never going to be as popular as Musk proclaimed, and that was before his relationship to Donald Trump and online provocations pushed many more people away from the Tesla brand. Cost didn’t help, either. Tesla once said it would sell a $40,000 basic version of Cybertruck, a price point that might have enticed some buyers beyond the Musk fanboys who became early adopters, but the cheapest one you can actually buy today is around $60,000.

Still, the vehicle’s third-quarter performance is particularly damning in comparison to nationwide EV sales, where the tax credit’s demise ignited a fire sale. Americans bought more than 430,000 EVs during the quarter, an increase of about 40% from the second quarter of 2025 and about 30% from the third quarter of last year. Popular vehicles including the Chevy Equinox EV, Hyundai Ioniq 5, Ford Mustang Mach-E, and Honda Prologue surged to sales of more than 20,000 during the quarter. Electric trucks including the Rivian R1T, Ford F-150 Lightning, and GMC Hummer EV saw sales increases despite having high prices that rival the Cybertruck’s.

Tesla itself, despite months of bad press, did well, too. The brand’s share of the overall EV market continues to wane, reaching a new low of 41%. But the surge temporarily stabilized its tumbling sales, with plenty of people snatching up Model 3s and Model Ys while the getting was good. Those two vehicles remained the two best-selling EVs in America, with Tesla selling more than 114,000 Model Ys and more than 53,000 Model 3s.

Yet the good times did nothing to spur driver interest in Cybertruck. In fact, public enthusiasm for the vehicle might be even lower than it seems, because it turns out that one of the top customers for Musk’s electric tank is Musk himself. Electrek reports that his other companies, such as SpaceX and xAI, have been accumulating Cybertrucks as their company cars. Tesla is replacing some of its own fleet with Cybertrucks, as well.

The move makes sense for Musk. Because of weak overall demand, Cybertrucks are sitting idle on lots; selling them to his businesses at least puts them to work. The scheme also might improve the appearance of Tesla’s sales numbers, Electrek speculates. By locking in some of these sales with a downpayment before the end of September, Tesla can deliver Cybertrucks to Musk’s other business in the weeks to come and still get the tax credit on them. The approach could boost sales numbers for a fourth quarter that’s likely to be difficult with the disappearance of the federal incentive.

Now that Cybertruck has become Elon’s Edsel, Tesla’s hopes for an EV sales revival lie largely with the new “Standard” versions of its two best-sellers. These trim levels strip away some of the amenities from the Models 3 and Y to bring their starting prices down to $37,000 and $40,000, respectively. It’s far from clear that this will succeed. Anyone shopping for an EV solely on price could wait for the upcoming new versions of the Nissan Leaf and Chevy Bolt, which are expected to come in at $30,000 or less. The Equinox’s $35,000 starting price, five-grand less than even the budget Model Y crossover, has spurred its recent success.

Still, with 320-plus miles of estimated range and at least some of Tesla’s best features, the budget versions could be compelling cars at those prices. At the very least, they’ll speak to more drivers than the Cybertruck does.",https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MTc1NTY1NC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTgwNjk3MTA0OH0.ZiBrkrbxuXdBl0oB6RzDxyNLXOJL8NHI3haFkBvZtmY/image.jpg?width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C100%2C0%2C100,N,,2025-10-16 11:17:02.855454

(By Mike Moen. Minnesota News Connection) – Minnesota’s green jobs sector is roaring just as the weight of federal changes sinks in.

A new report from the group Clean Energy Economy Minnesota showed 2024 was another banner year, with nearly 64,000 people working in renewable energy fields. The job growth rate for people doing things like installing solar panels was twice that of the state’s overall workforce. However, the numbers do not factor in more recent moves by the Trump administration and Congressional Republicans to unravel federal incentives.

Cathy Liebowitz, senior manager of membership engagement for the group, said given the major policy shift, they cannot guarantee some jobs will stick around, although it does not mean the wheels are falling off, either.

“We are not predicting that record-breaking growth in the following year,” Liebowitz acknowledged. “But we’re also not predicting significant reversals.”",https://media-cdn.socastsrm.com/wordpress/wp-content/blogs.dir/2404/files/2025/10/adobestock-328673896-1.jpeg,N,,2025-10-16 11:13:51.617302

Preskill adds as the federal government takes a backseat, it’s up to states to support renewable and clean jobs.

“The good news is we have states here in the Midwest that are already exemplifying clean energy leadership,"" Preskill said. ""States like Michigan, Illinois, Minnesota. Beyond that, we’re looking to states to pass policies that will power data centers with clean energy. We’re looking for states to work collaboratively for new transmissions to be built, and to do what they can to fast-track renewable energy deployment before solar and wind tax credits expire.”

The move looks set to reshape sourcing and supplier relationships as the automaker counters disruption from US President Donald Trump’s tariffs, which are already impacting competitors’ manufacturing and supply chains.

Antonio Filosa, CEO at Stellantis, says the plan supports a customer-first approach and ensures Stellantis strengthens its position in one of its most important global markets.

""This investment in the US – the single largest in the company’s history – will drive our growth, strengthen our manufacturing footprint and bring more American jobs to the states we call home,"" he says.

""Accelerating growth in the US has been a top priority since my first day. Success in America is not just good for Stellantis in the US – it makes us stronger everywhere.""

Impact on sourcing and supply

The US$13bn programme is the largest in the company’s 100-year US history.

Stellantis is targeting a 50% uplift in annual vehicle production and the creation of more than 5,000 jobs across Illinois, Ohio, Michigan and Indiana. It is funding five all-new vehicle launches in key categories, a full new four-cylinder engine and ongoing powertrain updates.

Nineteen refreshed models are scheduled across the US assembly network through to 2029.

For procurement, this unlocks multi-year waves of capex sourcing for plant retooling, automation, dies and moulds, test equipment, as well as serial production awards for engines, driveline, chassis, body, interiors, electronics and software-enabled features.

Volume ramp-ups require strategic material strategies across steel, aluminium, polymers and semiconductors, alongside capacity assurance with tier-1 and tier-2s.

Localisation as a tariff shield

The strategy doubles down on domestic manufacturing to mitigate tariff exposure and logistics risk.

With 34 US sites across 14 states and a network of more than 48,000 employees, 2,600 dealers and almost 2,300 suppliers, Stellantis is using local content and shorter supply lines to protect cost, service and speed to market.

The expectation is that localisation clauses, origin tracking and revised terms wll feature in new contracts as the company balances internal combustion and electrified portfolios.

Illinois: Belvidere reboot

Stellantis will invest more than US600m to reopen Belvidere Assembly in 2027, focused on Jeep Cherokee and Jeep Compass for the US market, creating 3,300 jobs.

The restart anchors a regional Jeep footprint and will drive fresh RFQs for final assembly tooling, supplier park services and inbound logistics.

The investment also supports expanded R&D tied to the broader plan, signalling demand for engineering services and prototype parts.

Ohio: Midsize truck shift concentrates know-how in Toledo

Nearly US$400m is going to the Toledo Assembly Complex to build an all-new midsize truck from 2028, moved from Illinois to sit with Jeep Wrangler and Gladiator.

The model, previously designated for Illinois, has been shifted to the Toledo Assembly Complex where it will sit alongside the Jeep Wrangler and Jeep Gladiator.

Production is expected to launch in 2028, with Stellantis estimating the move will create more than 900 new jobs.

Michigan & Indiana: Flexible supply

Two moves reshape Michigan sourcing. Warren Truck Assembly will be retooled to produce a range-extended EV and an ICE large SUV from 2028 with a US$100m investment and 900 plus roles.

Stellantis has confirmed a US$130m investment to prepare the Detroit Assembly Complex – Jefferson for the next-generation Dodge Durango launching in 2029.

Should You Invest $1,000 in General Motors Right Now?
Before you consider General Motors, you'll want to hear this.
While General Motors currently has a Moderate Buy rating among analysts, top-rated analysts believe these five stocks are better buys.","General Motors NYSE: GM announced on Oct. 14 that it will take a significant $1.6 billion charge in its third-quarter earnings report results, a move directly tied to a strategic realignment of its electric vehicle (EV) production plans. On the surface, a billion-dollar write-down often signals trouble, and the news caused initial hesitation among investors.

However, the story runs much deeper for a company trading at a modest nine times trailing earnings with a steady 1.05% dividend yield.

This move is not a sign of failure but a display of proactive leadership, adapting to a fluid market. Investors should consider this a hallmark of a resilient and well-run company. While the headline number is substantial, the logic behind it suggests a disciplined pivot toward profitability that benefits shareholders in the long run.

For investors, understanding the reason behind this charge is key to recognizing the opportunity this strategy change presents.

A Strategic Retreat: Prioritizing Profit Over Production

The $1.6 billion charge is a calculated business decision, not an unexpected loss. The figure has two main components: a non-cash impairment of approximately $1.2 billion for underutilized EV-related assets and about $400 million in cash costs to exit specific supplier contracts.

This action directly and logically responds to two key market shifts impacting the entire auto industry. First, the rapid, government-incentivized growth in EV adoption has begun to moderate to a more sustainable, albeit slower, pace.

Second, the expiration of federal EV tax credits had removed a significant purchasing incentive for many consumers in the near term.

Faced with these realities, GM is choosing fiscal discipline over blind ambition. Instead of building vehicles at a loss simply to meet previous volume targets, the company is adjusting its production schedule to match actual consumer demand.

This strategic pivot prevents the costly mistake of overproducing vehicles that could end up sitting on lots, eroding margins and tying up valuable cash. By taking this charge now, GM is effectively prioritizing the long-term profitability of its EV division over short-term production numbers.

The ICE Business Powering the Pivot

General Motors' ability to make such a significant strategic adjustment in its emerging EV business is underwritten by its core operations' immense and consistent power. The company's portfolio of traditional internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles remains dominant, generating the cash flow needed to fund its future and reward its shareholders. The strength of this profit engine was on full display in the most recent sales data.

Powerful Sales Momentum: In the third quarter, GM's U.S. vehicle sales surged by 8% year-over-year. Through the first nine months of 2025, sales are up 10% to 2.2 million vehicles, demonstrating powerful and sustained consumer demand.

Dominance in High-Margin Segments: GM continues its decades-long reign in the most profitable corners of the auto market. It is on track to lead the U.S. full-size pickup market for the sixth consecutive year, commanding roughly 40% of the market. Its leadership in the full-size SUV segment is even more pronounced, where it is poised to top the market for an incredible 51st consecutive year with approximately 60% market share.

Broad-Based Brand Strength: This success is not limited to trucks. Buick was the fastest-growing mainstream brand through the first three quarters, and Cadillac recorded its best Q3 sales since 2013.

Building Value Through Discipline and Partnerships

This pivot toward EV profitability is part of a broader corporate strategy focused on fiscal discipline and efficient growth. This is evident not only in how the company is managing its EV transition but also in how it deploys capital globally and returns it to shareholders.

In a forward-thinking move demonstrating capital efficiency, GM recently partnered with Hyundai to co-develop five new vehicles for key markets in the Americas. This collaboration allows both automakers to share development costs and platforms, targeting a combined 800,000 annual vehicle sales once fully scaled. This is an innovative, low-cost strategy to expand market presence.

This operational excellence extends to challenging international markets. In China, GM's joint ventures saw sales increase by 10.1% in Q3, driven by a popular NEV lineup. This success proves the company can compete and win where many rivals have stumbled.

This global profitability translates directly into shareholder value. Management is signaling strong confidence in the company's earnings power by actively returning capital through an ongoing share repurchase program with $4.3 billion in remaining authorization and a consistent, recently increased quarterly dividend.

Opportunity in the Oversell: Why GM's Stock Looks Attractive Now

For investors, the $1.6 billion charge should be viewed not as a liability, but as an investment in a more efficient and profitable future. GM is carefully tuning its EV growth engine for the long haul, powered by the immense cash flow of its ICE business.

This disciplined approach strengthens the company's financial resilience. GM’s analyst community appears to be recognizing this, with analysts at Evercore ISI recently raising their price target on GM stock to $68. Investors should look for further confirmation of this underlying strength during the company's third-quarter earnings call on Oct. 21.

Key items to monitor are the company's full-year guidance, commentary on EBIT-adjusted margins, and the outlook for adjusted automotive free cash flow.

The market's short-term focus on the headline charge may obscure the business's long-term strength, creating what appears to be a compelling entry point for those with a long-term investment horizon.

Our collaboration with TotalEnergies is an important step towards strengthening joint efforts and harnessing the potential of the public and private sectors, and combining efforts to achieve the resilience of our coastal ecosystems, ensuring a sustainable future for our planet.""

Abu Dhabi is home to three types of seagrass meadows, which cover an area of ​​3,000 square kilometres, supporting more than 3,500 dugongs and 4,000 green sea turtles, among other marine life. Abu Dhabi is home to the world’s second-largest dugong population after Australia, which feeds exclusively on seagrass. This makes protecting, conserving, and developing seagrass meadows vital for their survival.

The project has successfully planted 10,000 square metres of seaweed, capable of storing 52 tonnes of carbon, equivalent to 23 flights from Abu Dhabi to London, in alignment with the “2030 Seagrass Breakthrough of the UN Ocean Decade of Ocean Science”. It relies on the use of the most widespread seagrass species in the emirate, ‘Halodule uninervis’, and incorporates the latest technology and innovations for post-cropping monitoring and follow-up.

Since 1999, TotalEnergies has partnered with EAD to protect Abu Dhabi’s ecosystems – supporting dugong conservation, protecting flamingo habitats, conducting research on coastal resilience to climate change, and promoting biodiversity research at Al Wathba. Their work promotes initiatives focused on nature-based solutions, improving soil and air quality in mangrove forests, seagrass and salt marshes. A key outcome is the dugong and Seagrass Research Toolkit, now used in over 40 dugong and 80 seagrass range states.

Samir Oumer, President TotalEnergies EP UAE and TotalEnergies Country Chair, said: “Our collaboration with the Environment Agency – Abu Dhabi (EAD) reflects our deep commitment to marine biodiversity and ecosystem restoration.

Europe is sabotaging its own climate goals, because it is prioritizing the protection of its car industry over allowing affordable Chinese electric vehicles.
It turns the green transition into a trade fight with China and risks slowing the green transformation it urgently needs.
Instead of raising tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles, the EU should establish a Green Trade Truce based on transparency, cooperation and fair competition.","In October 2024, the European Commission announced additional tariffs of up to 35% on the existing 10% duties for Chinese electric vehicles, following a months-long anti-subsidy investigation into manufacturers such as BYD and Geely. The move came amid rising tensions in EU–China trade relations, with Brussels accusing Beijing of distorting global competition through heavy state support. Since then, the issue has only intensified. China has filed a formal complaint at the World Trade Organization, threatened retaliatory measures on European wine and dairy products, and EU member states remain divided over whether the tariffs should be softened or upheld. With the important global summit COP 30 approaching, Europe has a chance to show whether it will lead the green transition through cooperation or undermine its own decarbonisation goal with the trade barriers. The decision has sparked a heated debate across Europe: is the EU defending fair competition or jeopardizing its own green transition?

Europe is sabotaging its own climate goals, because it is prioritizing the protection of its car industry over allowing affordable Chinese electric vehicles. It turns the green transition into a trade fight with China and risks slowing the green transformation it urgently needs.

Europe doesn’t need a trade war, it needs a strategy. Instead of raising tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles, the EU should establish a Green Trade Truce based on transparency, cooperation and fair competition. Brussels could invite Chinese and European producers to adhere to strict and verifiable standards on battery carbon footprints and recycled material content. In exchange, tariffs could be reduced for companies that comply. This approach would protect Europe’s interests, maintain affordable EVs for consumers, and advance climate goals.

The Commission’s new duties on Chinese EVs are trying to protect European industry from unfair subsidies and overcapacity. However, they may have the opposite effect by slowing electrification and raising costs for households. Chinese models are often 20–30 percent cheaper and are more advanced, not only because of state support. Over the past decade, China has built a tightly integrated EV ecosystem, due to their battery manufacturing, refining key materials like lithium and scaling production quickly. Furthermore, its carmakers benefit from strong domestic demand, lower labour costs, and direct access to the entire supply chain. Europe in contrast faces fragmented production, higher energy costs and a complex regulatory framework, which makes it hard to compete. Even tough tariffs may temporarily hide these weaknesses, but they do not address the underlying issues.

The irony is that Europe’s challenge is not insufficient protection, but to be innovative and be proactive. Approving new gigafactories can take years and the charging infrastructure remains underdeveloped in many areas, like Hungary or Ireland. Additionally, the high power prices for the industry in comparison to the U.S. or China, makes It difficult to match the prices. Tariffs will not fix any of these bottlenecks. A smarter policy would focus on accelerating domestic competitiveness. With faster approvals, cheaper green power and coordinated incentives for battery innovation. This approach has proven effective elsewhere: China’s rise in the EV sector was built on clear industrial targets, massive R&D support, and scale-oriented subsidies, while the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act shows how targeted incentives can mobilize private investment. Europe can succeed the same way, by designing incentives that reward innovation and scale, rather than defaulting to protectionism.

Of course, Europe shouldn’t just accept unfair trade, because Chinese EV makers benefit from extensive state subsidies, cheap credits, and below-market access to raw materials, which gives them an artificial cost advantage that undermines free competition. That is precisely what the Commission’s 2023 anti-subsidy probe wants to address. If the Commission can prove that certain Chinese carmakers benefit from heavy state subsidies, then a measured response with for example targeted tariffs is a legitimate option. However, just using duties on every import is a naïve weapon, which invites retaliation, disrupts global supply chains, and undermines Europe’s image as a defender of fair and open trade. Moreover, it exposes a double standard: Europe wants to claim climate leadership and demands global cooperation on carbon reduction, yet at the same time uses tariffs on affordable electric cars from China, which reduces their availability and slows EV adoption.

An approach which prioritizes standards would turn Europe’s regulatory strength into a competitive advantage.

Stellantis is making a decisive move to strengthen its presence in the US auto market, committing $13 billion to expand its domestic production footprint. The investment is the largest in the company’s 100-year US history and reflects a strategic bet on American manufacturing as the industry enters a pivotal phase of transformation.

The four-year plan includes five new vehicle launches, 19 refreshed models and the creation of more than 5,000 jobs across facilities in Illinois, Ohio, Michigan and Indiana. Stellantis expects to boost annual vehicle production in the US by 50 percent, reinforcing its long-term strategy to compete in high-demand segments and deliver new technologies to market.

Jeep factory reopens in Illinois

A centerpiece of the plan is the reopening of the Belvidere, Illinois, plant. Once idled in 2023, the facility will resume production with two key Jeep models, the Cherokee and Compass, beginning in 2027. The Jeep factory reopening will create about 3,300 jobs and signals a renewed commitment to domestic assembly.

In addition, the Toledo, Ohio, plant will receive nearly $400 million to support the production of a new midsize truck. Originally designated for Belvidere, the program has been reassigned to Toledo, where the Jeep Wrangler and Gladiator are currently built. Stellantis says the investment will generate more than 900 jobs at the complex.

EV and engine production expands

The company is also preparing for a more electrified product line. In Warren, Michigan, Stellantis plans to retool its plant to build a large SUV powered by both a range-extended electric system and a traditional internal combustion engine. Production is expected to begin in 2028 and add more than 900 jobs. In Detroit, the company will invest $130 million to launch the next-generation Dodge Durango by 2029.

In Indiana, more than $100 million will go toward expanding Stellantis’ powertrain output. The Kokomo facilities will become the production hub for the new GMET4 EVO four-cylinder engine starting in 2026. The expansion is expected to create over 100 jobs and anchor Indiana’s role in advanced engine manufacturing.

A shift in US car manufacturing

This move by Stellantis reflects a growing trend in US car manufacturing growth. As automakers respond to shifting consumer preferences and federal incentives, domestic investment is becoming critical to long-term competitiveness. The US electric vehicle market is expanding, and companies like Stellantis are adopting flexible production strategies that support both electric and gasoline-powered models.

The $13 billion Stellantis US investment is not only a show of confidence in American manufacturing, it is also a response to rising pressure to localize production. As federal policies reward homegrown development, Stellantis appears well positioned to lead the next phase of automotive growth.

Trump said Wednesday that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi had personally assured him his country would stop buying Russian oil, in a move that might add to pressure on Moscow to negotiate an end to the war in Ukraine.

“There will be no oil. He’s not buying oil,” Trump said. The change won’t take immediately, he said, but “within a short period of time.”

India is the second biggest buyer of Russian oil after China. Trump cited its purchases from Moscow when he announced 50% tariffs on imports from India in August.

A statement Thursday by India’s foreign ministry did not address Trump’s remarks directly. It said the government’s consistent priority was to safeguard the interests of Indian consumers in a volatile energy environment.

“Ensuring stable energy prices and secured supplies have been the twin goals of our energy policy. This includes broad basing our energy sourcing and diversifying as appropriate to meet market conditions,” said Randhir Jaiswal, a ministry spokesman.

He said the Trump administration had shown interest in deepening energy cooperation and talks on that were underway.

Expanding India’s energy dealings with the U.S. could help India mitigate supply disruptions and align with Washington’s push to reduce global dependence on Russian oil.

India’s Trade Secretary Rajesh Agarwal said Wednesday that India was willing to increase its purchases of American oil and natural gas if prices were competitive.

Agarwal told reporters India has been buying around $12-$13 billion worth of crude oil and gas from the U.S. annually and there was room to nearly double that without causing disruptions for Indian refiners.

A team of Indian government officials was visiting the U.S. to discuss a bilateral trade agreement that includes energy cooperation, he said.

“In discussions we are in, we have indicated very positively that India as a country would like to diversify its portfolio as far as energy imports are concerned. That’s the best strategy for a big buyer like India,” said Agarwal.

In February, Modi and Trump set a target of finalizing the first tranche of a trade agreement by autumn. Talks were suspended after five formal rounds of negotiations after Trump expressed displeasure over India’s continued purchases of Russian oil. He said that was helping to fuel Moscow’s war against Ukraine.

Trump has been frustrated by his inability to force an end to the war in Ukraine, which began with Russia’s invasion almost four years ago. He’s expressed dissatisfaction with Russian President Vladimir Putin, whom he increasingly describes as the primary obstacle to a resolution, and he’s scheduled to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Friday.

In recent weeks, Modi has engaged positively on Trump’s social media posts, including the one about first stage of a peace deal between Israel and Hamas, suggesting New Delhi is keen to expand cooperation with the U.S. In turn, Trump called Modi his “friend” and wished him well on his birthday last month.",https://www.greenfieldreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/preview-1190.jpg,N,,2025-10-16 06:59:45.859443

AI data centers, which depend on GPUs and other advanced computing systems for processing, require far more electricity than traditional facilities.","Pennsylvania is positioning itself as a rising contender in the competitive race for AI data centers. With its abundant natural gas reserves and strategic location, the state is pursuing an ambitious $70 billion initiative to attract major data center investments and transform its economic landscape.

Announced in July at the Pennsylvania Energy and Innovation Summit, held at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, the plan includes a series of high-profile projects aimed at bolstering infrastructure and energy capacity. Unlike federally backed efforts such as the CHIPS Act, Pennsylvania's initiative relies entirely on state-level coordination and private investment.

A Comprehensive Infrastructure Approach

Pennsylvania’s initiative supports a wide range of projects tied to data center operations. These efforts include supplying energy to data centers, enhancing the power grid, and training workers for industry demands. Interestingly, direct investments in data centers themselves are a smaller portion of the plan. The majority of the projects focus on improving power delivery, which has bottlenecked data center expansion and construction.

Pennsylvania’s Energy Advantage

Pennsylvania’s energy resources play a key role in its strategy to attract data center investments. The state is rich in coal and natural gas, with natural gas as the largest source of in-state electricity generation, according to the US Energy Information Administration.

Pennsylvania’s location atop the Appalachian Basin, home to some of the nation’s richest shale gas reservoirs, further strengthens its energy profile. The state is the second-largest natural gas producer in the United States, trailing only Texas, and ranks as the third-largest coal-producing state, following Wyoming and West Virginia.

These abundant energy resources position Pennsylvania as a prime location for power-hungry AI data centers.

Major Projects and Investments

The state has secured commitments from major technology companies and investors across multiple high-value projects.

One of Pennsylvania’s most ambitious projects under the $70 billion initiative is converting an abandoned Aliquippa, Pa., steel mill into a high-density data center complex. This $25 billion redevelopment effort is backed by investment giant Blackstone, which is also partnering with PPL Corp. in a joint venture focused on power generation. Additionally, CoreWeave announced a $6 billion investment to develop a data center with up to 300 MW of capacity in Lancaster, Pa., representing one of the largest single data center investments in the region. Energy Capital Partners also announced a $5 billion plan to build a data center at the York II Energy Center in Delta, Pa.

Google has committed to a 20-year deal with New York-based Brookfield Asset Management to repower two Pennsylvania hydropower facilities – Safe Harbor Hydro Facility and Holtwood Hydro Facility – resulting in 670 MW of power generation. Meanwhile, PA Data Center Partners and Powerhouse Data Centers revealed a $15 billion plan to develop a three-campus data center hub near Carlisle, Pa., with a total capacity of 1.3 GW.

Beyond infrastructure, the initiative includes workforce development through the Energy Innovation Center Infrastructure Academy, a first-of-its-kind regional training facility for energy and AI infrastructure workers. Meta has also joined the effort with a $2.5 million investment in partnership with the Schwartz Center for Entrepreneurship at Carnegie Mellon University to support rural Pennsylvania startups, along with community accelerator training for small businesses.

Meeting AI’s Massive Power Demand

Pennsylvania emphasizes its ability to meet the substantial energy demands of AI data centers. AI data centers, which depend on GPUs and other advanced computing systems for processing, require far more electricity than traditional facilities. Pennsylvania’s natural gas reserves provide a reliable energy supply and offer cost advantages compared to other states reliant on renewable energy or imported resources.

Industry analysts see Pennsylvania’s approach as game-changing. “Many states like Virginia, Oregon, and Texas have created incentive programs, but the number of recent announcements in Pennsylvania … is unprecedented,” said Alvin Nguyen, Senior Analyst with Forrester Research. “They have made an impressive push.”

Nguyen highlighted Pennsylvania’s advantages, including ample land, abundant water resources, and a skilled workforce, making it an ideal location for AI data centers and factories. “Pennsylvania’s push can definitely take away business from Northern Virginia and other existing data center markets,” he noted.

Overcoming Historical Challenges

The transformation represents a dramatic shift for a state once overlooked by the data center industry. Bob Ricci, President of DVM Power + Control, a West Chester, Pa.-based infrastructure supplier for data centers, explained that Pennsylvania was not considered ideal for data centers due in part to high utility costs. “Recently, because of the amount of natural gas and utility available in the state, it's become sort of a statewide effort to … develop data centers,” he said.

Ricci noted the bipartisan appeal of Pennsylvania’s potential billions in data center construction. Pennsylvania mirrors Texas by using abundant energy resources to create jobs and attract businesses. “[Pennsylvania] is really leveraging that energy supply to create great jobs and bring businesses in,” Ricci said.

The Power of State-Level Support

Data center operators are particularly enthusiastic about Pennsylvania’s coordinated state-level approach. Joe Minarik, COO of DataBank, a Dallas-based data center operator, cited the benefits of state-level support for these initiatives. Typically, data center operators work with municipalities to secure incentives – a complex and time-consuming process. Pennsylvania’s statewide effort simplifies this. “When you have the state backing it, it really helps get through those regulatory hurdles a lot better,” Minarik said.

Minarik emphasized the need for collaboration between municipalities and state governments in data center projects. “You need the local support to manage through it, because that's where a lot of the constituents are that are going to want to know what's going on in their community,” he said.

He also noted the state’s critical role in managing power distribution from major plants. “You need the state to back it, because that's where a lot of the distribution levels come in at the larger power [plants]. … You need both to be able to work hand in hand,” he explained.

Minarik praised Pennsylvania’s approach: “I like the idea of what they're doing. I think it'll bring a lot of ease of doing business through efforts for the local government.”",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt8eb3cdfc1fce5194/bltdeb2bf64da3922b3/68f015922cba580bc92cfe38/battery_icon_charging_on_an_abstract_tech_background.jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2025-10-16 07:59:50.928970

Locally, the canceled contracts include over $7.5 million to Cornell University, $3.6 million to Ecolectro Inc., and over $2 million to Dimensional Energy Inc., all based in Ithaca.

“Families and small businesses in the Southern Tier are already getting squeezed by sky-high utility bills, and now this administration wants to make it even harder to keep the lights on,” said Congressman Josh Riley. “These cuts will only make life more expensive for working people.”

The cap is lower when it’s hot out because power lines can easily overheat; conversely, power lines can carry more electricity when it’s cold or windy.
Those assumptions can result in a fixed rating for how much power a transmission line can handle without overheating.
While hurricane-force gusts are damaging to power lines, a moderate breeze can cool them enough to increase how much power they can carry.
The software combines terrain maps around power lines with detailed weather forecasts and utilizes artificial intelligence to predict the temperature of transmission lines.","The U.S. power grid has an efficiency problem. But software upgrades and introducing specialized data could provide relief to strained and congested power lines, according to a new study from the company Gridraven.

The transmission lines that connect generation resources like wind farms and power plants to cities and suburbs are limited by the maximum amount of electricity they can carry. That capacity often depends on the weather. The cap is lower when it’s hot out because power lines can easily overheat; conversely, power lines can carry more electricity when it’s cold or windy.

Gridraven has offices in Estonia and Austin, Texas, and the company’s team is composed of software engineers and weather data scientists. In an interview with Straight Arrow News, Gridraven CEO Georg Rute said, “we help existing power lines carry more energy.”

In a report released Tuesday, the company examined the effects of applying Gridraven software known as Claw to a transmission line in South Texas. The report found Claw software could have allowed 30% more power to flow through the transmission line and saved ratepayers about $2.5 million over the summer months, the company said.

Gridraven is one of several companies at the forefront of Dynamic Line Rating (DLR), the name for optimizing how much power can be sent through transmission lines based on changing weather conditions. As electricity demand increases, energy analysts are looking to solutions beyond building new power plants. DLR has emerged as a promising technology for increasing the gird’s capacity, potentially saving consumers money at a time when utility bills are going up.

How can dynamic line rating help the grid?

A 2019 U.S. Department of Energy study described how grid operators typically make a series of “conservative assumptions” to determine how much power they can send through transmission lines. Those assumptions can result in a fixed rating for how much power a transmission line can handle without overheating.

DLR software works by integrating weather forecasts and adjusting line ratings. Gridraven uses software only, but some DLR solutions involve adding sensors to power lines.

The company focuses on wind. While hurricane-force gusts are damaging to power lines, a moderate breeze can cool them enough to increase how much power they can carry.

“If you have a hot wire, then it’s cooled twice as much if there’s a bit of wind,” Rute said.

Fixed line ratings become a problem for the grid when the amount of power generated exceeds a transmission line’s limit, and power is wasted. In Texas, lower-cost power sources — often wind and solar — are curtailed when transmission lines reach capacity, but the additional power may still be needed. To keep supply steady, a power plant somewhere else in the state will ramp up and send power through a non-congested line.

On the grid run by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), congestion costs from turning on expensive power sources while cheaper ones are curtailed adds up to between $1 and $2 billion annually. Utility companies generally pass congestion costs on to ratepayers.

Although DLR cannot eliminate congestion, especially in hot conditions, proponents of grid enhancing technology say it can spot when curtailment is truly necessary, versus when it’s based on assumptions that do not reflect actual weather conditions.

In many cases, Rute said, “there’s actually more capacity in that line, so there is no congestion, therefore the prices can be evened out.”

A 2025 pre-print study from researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology simulated the effects of DLR on the Texas grid. The study found that the average transmission capacity on the entire grid could increase by 43% in the summer and 52% in the winter by utilizing DLR on only the most thermally constrained power lines.

How does Gridraven’s software work?

While the MIT researchers’ results are based on a system-wide simulation, Gridraven’s new study simulates the effects of its software on one congested transmission line southeast of San Antonio.

The Gridraven Claw uses satellite data and LIDAR scans from the U.S. Geological Survey to create detailed 3D terrain maps. Rute said the system accounts for every tree, building and landscape feature that affects wind patterns at a local level.

The software combines terrain maps around power lines with detailed weather forecasts and utilizes artificial intelligence to predict the temperature of transmission lines.

“Grid operators need to have full resolution about what the wind is doing everywhere on the lines before they can push more [power] through,” Rute said.

And Gridraven’s innovation is allowing grid operators to do this without making any physical changes to power lines.

Several companies are actively deploying DLR technology in the U.S.

Heimdall Power has a software platform; the company also uses drones to install sensors on power lines. The company deployed these sensors on the grid run by an electric cooperative in Minnesota, and found that it increased transmission capacity by 63% during peak power demand, according to a company white paper.

Massachusetts-based LineVision uses LIDAR sensors installed on transmission towers to gather real-time data. That data is combined with AI and weather forecasts. The company said deployment of 42 sensors in Indiana and Ohio helped yield a 40% increase in transmission capacity.

What are the barriers to adopting dynamic line rating?

Rute told SAN he anticipates that incentivizing utility companies to adopt DLR will be the primary barrier to growth.

“[Utilities] don’t have congestion costs on their balance sheet,” Rute said.

Instead, those costs are passed to consumers, so in most cases, installing a DLR solution will not directly lead to increased utility company profits. Additionally, the utility companies need to be motivated by goodwill to save customers money and increase the overall system efficiency.

Demand for power continues to grow, driven largely by the electricity needs of artificial intelligence data centers. While growing demand puts upward pressure on the price paid for electricity, Rute said, “there’s a lot of public pressure for utilities to not raise rates.” And making decisions that keep costs low will lead to greater “social capital” for utility companies.

Making his pitch to utilities, Rute added that Gridraven is “available at the cost of a weather forecast that you already have anyway.”",https://san.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/gridraven_Getty_Images_clean.jpg,N,,2025-10-16 11:14:21.946093

The project aims to divert billions of gallons of wastewater annually from Hoosier rivers and streams, and fulfills plans to address nearly all combined sewer overflows in Central Indiana.

DigIndy was completed after a 14-year construction process and will bolster Indiana’s progress in reducing sewage overflow events into Indiana’s waterways. A combined sewage overflow (CSO) is a utility wastewater discharge that occurs when rainfall or snowmelt exceeds the system’s capacity, causing it to be overwhelmed and discharge untreated sewage into rivers and streams, potentially posing a threat to human health and the environment.

In 2008, more than 35 billion gallons of untreated sewage were released from CSO events across Indiana. By 2024, that figure dropped to 10.2 billion gallons, a 71.3% reduction. IDEM tracks CSO volumes through required monthly discharge monitoring reports from utilities, field inspections, and data analysis, one of the most robust assessment programs in the U.S. These tools allow IDEM to assess compliance, measure progress, and ensure that communities are meeting commitments to protect water quality.

The $2 billion DigIndy Tunnel system covers 28 miles, with tunnels around 20 stories below the city. The system’s job is to collect sewage and stormwater overflows during heavy rains, treat it and then release it. The massive project is one of the largest public works projects in Indianapolis history, with 8 tunnels running through all parts of the city, including Irvington, Fountain Square, and Garfield Park.

Citizens Energy Group said it will divert at least 95% of sewage and stormwater so it can protect rivers and prevent flooding. Planning for the project began in 2006, after the city entered into the consent decree with the EPA that work must be completed by 2025.",,N,,2025-10-16 08:00:10.476850

Orsted operates a large portfolio of offshore wind farms and is building six more.
Since then, Orsted has led the way in building wind farms in waters off Europe and elsewhere, including Taiwan.
Not all of the Danish wind industry is struggling.
The Trump administration has taken several steps to curb offshore wind, including halting construction on two wind farms off the East Coast of the United States.","For the Danish wind farm developer Orsted, the bad news has not stopped. Once on its way to becoming a giant of renewable energy, the company is now shrinking in everything from stock market value to ambition.

The reversal of fortune comes amid a broad downturn in the offshore wind industry set off by rising construction costs and interest rates after the pandemic and exacerbated by President Trump’s dislike of wind farms.

Orsted, which helped create and dominated the offshore wind industry, has felt a huge impact from these setbacks. The company said last week that it would lay off 2,000 people, or 25 percent of its staff, over the next two years.

Rasmus Errboe, the company’s president and chief executive, offered a blunt explanation for the job cuts: Orsted was narrowing its focus and dialing back its aspirations.

Instead of lining up new, multibillion-dollar wind farms to build in shallow waters around the globe, Orsted will mainly focus on finishing those it has under construction and managing them or selling them off.

The company will complete “our large construction portfolio in the coming years, which is why we’ll need fewer employees,” Mr. Errboe said in a statement.

Orsted operates a large portfolio of offshore wind farms and is building six more. These arrays of enormous turbines produce the bulk of the company’s revenue, close to $7 billion this year, according to analysts’ estimates.

The reshaping of Orsted is rippling across its home country, Denmark, which for half a century has been a nurturing ground of the contemporary wind industry.

A predecessor of Orsted built the world’s first offshore wind farm, Vindeby, in 1991 in Denmark. Since then, Orsted has led the way in building wind farms in waters off Europe and elsewhere, including Taiwan. Europe now has more than 3,600 offshore wind turbines, many of them developed by Orsted.

Not all of the Danish wind industry is struggling. Vestas Wind Systems, the leading maker of wind turbines, looks better positioned for the current environment because it is largely focused on land-based equipment rather than offshore machines and has factories in Colorado that should help buffer any impact from Mr. Trump’s tariffs.

Orsted said 235 of the 500 layoffs planned for this quarter would be in Denmark, where some 33,000 people work in the wind industry, according to Green Power Denmark, an industry group.

The wind industry employs roughly 370,000 people in Europe and accounts for around 20 percent of the region’s electricity generation, according to WindEurope, a trade body.

As much as any country, Denmark has embraced a vision of a future in which much of the global economy runs to a great extent on electricity generated from green sources.

Recent developments, though, including rising costs and the Trump administration’s efforts to stymie renewable energy, have prompted a reassessment of some of the goals that the European Union and national authorities have set for the industry.

Wood Mackenzie, an energy consulting firm, forecast that less than 50 percent of the cumulative targets set by national governments, excluding China, for offshore wind for the end of the decade will be achieved.

“I think, in terms of electrification, there are certainly warning signs,” said Anders Kronborg, senior economist at Copenhagen Economics, a research firm.

The Trump administration has taken several steps to curb offshore wind, including halting construction on two wind farms off the East Coast of the United States. It later allowed one, Empire Wind off New York, to move forward. A federal judge ruled that the other, Revolution Wind, a nearly completed Orsted project off Rhode Island, could continue.

Still, the intervention in projects where billions of dollars have already been spent has created uncertainty about investing in the United States.

“In the coming years, nobody will start any new projects in offshore wind in the U.S.,” said Anders Schelde, the chief financial officer of AkademikerPension, a Danish pension fund that invests in green energy. “I’m sure that it will probably also have some impact on other renewables,” he added.

Welcon, which fashions giant wind turbine sections called towers in the town of Give, in western Denmark, is supplying Orsted’s Revolution Wind and Sunrise Wind projects but is not expecting any new business from across the Atlantic.

“I don’t believe in the U.S. before we have a new president,” said Carsten Pedersen, the company’s chairman.

Mr. Pedersen said that Welcon’s vast factory in the flatlands of the Jutland peninsula had orders through 2027 but that he worried about the stamina of weaker companies and the lost momentum toward cleaner energy.

“It’s so sad, I think, what’s happening now,” he said. “We had a chance to make the green transition.”

The Danish government, which owns a majority of Orsted’s shares, has had to come to the aid of the company and the wind industry it supports by putting around $4.7 billion into a recent offering to shareholders.

“In my view, this is a business that is going to be around,” said Charles Lemonides, founder of ValueWorks, a New York-based fund management company that increased its stake in Orsted to about $15 million. “The world’s not using less electricity,” he added.

Analysts, though, say that in the coming years, Orsted is likely to be diminished as an instrument for expanding wind power. The company has been forced to concentrate on survival.

“After these assets are built, they don’t really have any other live projects,” said Deepa Venkateswaran, a utility analyst at Bernstein, a Wall Street research firm.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/16/multimedia/16biz-renewable-europe-01-zgbt/16biz-renewable-europe-01-zgbt-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-10-16 04:58:28.599666

The report indicates the pace of job creation in Iowa’s clean energy sector last year was six times faster than in the overall job market. The group warns the clear energy industry is facing headwinds this year, however.

Preskill says the “One Big Beautiful Bill” President Trump signed in July phases out federal tax credits for renewable energy projects and the group estimates 22 BILLION dollars worth of clean energy projects in the United States have already been delayed or cancelled this year. “This comes at a time when we’re in an energy emergency,” Preskill says. “Demand is rising fast, so making it harder to deploy clean energy which is the cheapest, fastest source of new power is bad for the economy and, of course, bad for jobs.”

Preskill says action at the state level is key. “This report shows that clean energy is a bright spot in the Midwest economy,” Preskill said, “and the future of the Midwest’s clean energy economy depends on state leaders acting with urgency.” The group’s report says Iowa lawmakers should fast-track renewable energy deployment before the federal solar and wind tax credits expire and enact state tax incentives that help fill some of the void when the credits do go away.

The group says the rapid rise in data centers is contributing to unprecedented demand for electricity and states like Iowa should prioritize low-cost, clean options like solar and wind power to meet that demand. There are more than two dozen data centers in Iowa now and Microsoft, Google, Apple and Meta all plan to build more here.",https://www.kjan.com/index.php/2025/10/fb-kjan.png,N,,2025-10-16 10:06:53.944360

Sign up for their newsletter here.

During a recent visit to a Long Island power station, U.S. Department of Energy Secretary Chris Wright criticized Biden-era policies that supported the development of renewable energy sources.

“There was a lot of that money allocated under the Biden administration that was to encourage business and utilities to … spend money to make electricity more expensive and less reliable,” Wright said during a press conference.

The next day, the Trump administration announced the termination of 321 awards, claiming $7.5 billion in cuts for clean-energy projects. Inside Climate News recently reported that many of these awards were already past their end date.

Empire Clean Cities, which promotes the advancement of alternative fuels and alternative-fuel vehicles to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, was among the organizations that had its funds cut.

The Manhattan-based nonprofit will lose more than 90% of the funds for its $1.7 million award. So far, Empire Clean Cities had received only $162,631 of its award for a project designed to reduce emissions in Hunts Point in the Bronx, according to federal spending data. Largely due to truck traffic, this neighborhood has an annual child asthma hospitalization rate double the citywide average.

“It’s where folks live and work, and so they see every day the impact of truck traffic emissions on their air quality, on their health,” said Joy Gardner, the executive director of Empire Clean Cities. ​“This was a real opportunity to make a drastic change in just the general quality of life.”

Hunts Point attracts a high volume of freight traffic partly due to its proximity to food centers, including the Hunts Point Food Distribution Center. The city estimates that the center distributes around 4.5 billion pounds of food every year.

Empire Clean Cities is on the cusp of publishing an electrification plan for Hunts Point, with engagement from local businesses, communities, and city agencies. The plan would offer a pathway to electrification for vehicles operating in the neighborhood—and subsequently help alleviate the health issues many residents face.

Though Gardner said the plan is likely to still be published, other aspects of the plan could be delayed or may not happen at all. The nonprofit planned to install six fast-charging electric ports in the neighborhoods, for personal and freight vehicles, according to Gardner.

Empire Clean Cities also planned to provide technical assistance to businesses looking to electrify their truck fleets and information sessions for community members who might want to buy an electric vehicle. According to federal spending data, the nonprofit would ​“undertake an extensive suite of community outreach activities designed to break down the knowledge barriers preventing [electric vehicle] adoption in the neighborhood.”

“It’s really disappointing not to be able to take this over the finish line, especially with just a year left on the grant,” said Gardner. ​“We would have been able to do a tremendous amount with that.”

In a statement about the grant cancellations, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul (D) said, ​“These cuts directly impact local businesses and major companies, putting workers out of jobs, shuttering factories, and slowing our state’s economic progress.”

In response to questions from Inside Climate News, Ken Lovett, Hochul’s senior communications advisor on energy and environment, wrote that the announcement ​“came as no surprise given the Trump administration’s full-on assault on clean energy.”

The Trump administration announced the termination of 321 grants on Oct. 2. An Inside Climate News analysis of federal government spending data for the awards found that only 188 were still active, according to their stated end dates, at the end of September.

ICN subtracted money already sent to recipients from the sums obligated to be spent, calculating a total of $4.87 billion in cuts, roughly two-thirds of the dollar amount announced by the Department of Energy.

For recipients based in New York state, 20 awards were still active when the Trump administration announced the cuts. After accounting for the money already distributed, the state lost out on about $146 million.

But for Hochul, the grant cuts seem to be just the latest setback to her plans to deliver on the state’s lofty climate goals and address energy concerns. She has recently admitted that New York is unlikely to meet its climate targets, drawing the ire of many residents.

Hochul says she remains committed to reducing emissions in the state and has invested considerable funds toward that goal. She recently allocated $1 billion to clean-energy projects and emissions-reduction efforts and has directed the state-owned utility, the New York Power Authority, to build at least one new nuclear plant by 2040.

Hochul’s predicament

At a Brooklyn church in early September, the advocacy group Public Power NY hosted a People’s Hearing for Public Renewables, where officials, environmentalists, and a few dozen New York residents discussed the state’s renewable-energy plans and expressed disappointment with Hochul’s progress.

“We have a movement behind us that is fighting for something better,” said state Sen. Jabari Brisport, a Democrat who represents a district in Brooklyn. ​“We have a governor who wants to drag her feet.”

New York’s Climate Act requires the state to achieve a 40% reduction from 1990 levels in economy-wide greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and an 85% reduction by 2050. The act also requires that 70% of the state’s electricity come from renewable sources by 2030.

Residents were advocating for the New York Power Authority to build 15 gigawatts of renewable energy by 2030, which they view as necessary to meet the state’s goal of net-zero emissions from the electricity grid by 2040. Currently, the utility plans to build 7 gigawatts of renewable energy, despite state law requiring it to fill all gaps in electricity generation left by the private sector.

“Hurricane Ida completely destroyed my district,” said former Democratic U.S. Rep. Jamaal Bowman, whose district included White Plains and Yonkers. ​“We need a governor with human-centered leadership … and if not, we need a new governor.”

Much of the focus on achieving these climate goals has been on electrifying building heating and cooling with heat pumps and moving away from gas systems. In 2023, the state passed the All-Electric Building Act, which mandated that most buildings use electric appliances, and the all-electric standard was written into the state building code in July.

The legislation effectively requires most new buildings to be completely electric — so no gas heating or cooking. A similar law was passed in New York City in 2021.

At a recent press conference, Wright, the federal energy secretary, alluded to the ​“many productive dialogues” he has had with the governor, and said that two proposed gas pipelines, which would pass through the state and which state officials have rejected in the past, were ​“already planned” and would ​“lower the cost of heating.”

There has been speculation, fueled by a May post on X by Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum, that Hochul ​“would move forward on critical pipeline capacity.” The implication was that this was a trade-off for allowing the Empire Wind offshore wind project south of Long Island in the Atlantic Ocean to proceed after the administration halted construction.

Within a month, two previously rejected gas pipelines — the Constitution pipeline and the Northeast Supply Enhancement pipeline, or NESE — entered the regulatory process once again. Hochul has denied that she made a deal with the White House, but the Trump administration has said that she ​“caved” and agreed to allow the pipeline construction, according to Politico’s E&E News.

The Constitution pipeline, which the state rejected in 2016, would run from Pennsylvania’s Marcellus shale fracking sites to upstate New York. The NESE pipeline would extend an existing pipeline, building off the coast of New Jersey and Staten Island to eventually connect with existing pipes in Queens, and add gas infrastructure to Pennsylvania. The state has rejected it three times.

In July, National Grid, the gas utility that serves Staten Island, Long Island, and parts of Brooklyn and Queens, added the NESE pipeline to its long-term gas plan as an addendum.

The utility has to file a long-term gas plan as a result of a dispute with former Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D). The heart of the 2019 dispute was, ironically, an earlier proposal for the NESE pipeline, which the Department of Environmental Conservation had rejected due to its potential impacts on water quality.

The rejection led to a standoff between the utility and state officials, with National Grid refusing to connect customers to gas lines. The dispute only ended because Cuomo threatened to suspend the utility’s license to operate in the state. In the end, National Grid agreed to periodically file a long-term gas plan for review by the state’s Public Service Commission, which regulates utility rates.

The NESE pipeline resurfaces

While reviewing the utility’s plan for the future last month, members of the Public Service Commission found that the NESE project would help the state meet the energy needs of its residents and businesses, particularly in the wake of Winter Storm Elliott in 2022. A report by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission found that some areas of New York were at extreme risk of experiencing gas shutoffs at one point during the storm.

But many New Yorkers were dismayed by the commission’s choice, which has no regulatory authority over the pipeline, but which many believe could signal to the Department of Environmental Conservation that the pipeline is necessary and that it should approve its water permit.

“We are in a week-by-week, hour-by-hour, fight to hold [Hochul] off and keep her from approving this thing,” Pete Sikora, the climate and inequality campaigns director with New York Communities for Change, said about the fight to stop the NESE pipeline.

Several public officials, including Staten Island Borough President Vito Fossella (R) and U.S. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D), spoke out against the pipeline, as did the city of New York. Water-quality concerns and fears of substantial rate increases abound.

“The governor is willing to put the law off to the side in order to appease fossil-fuel interests, big private business interests … and for New York families to foot the bill for that,” said Kim Fraczek, the executive director of Sane Energy, a nonprofit organization that is advocating for the replacement of gas infrastructure with renewable energy. ​“Our costs will only increase, and that’s for ratepayers and for businesses.”

A report by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, an energy-research think tank, estimated that the pipeline would cost $1.25 billion — almost $200 million more than what National Grid had said — due to construction inflation. Even if National Grid’s figures are correct, ratepayers would suffer a substantial monthly increase.

Hochul is also experiencing pressure from the other side of the aisle. Energy Secretary Wright recently criticized the state’s Climate Act, which requires the state to have a net-zero-emissions electricity grid by 2040, calling it ​“totally nuts.”

“The longer and more aggressively [net-zero] is pursued, the more you elevate your energy prices and impoverish your citizens,” Wright told journalists at the press conference in Long Island earlier this month. ​“Let’s build more energy infrastructure to drive down the cost of energy here in New York state, across New England, and across our country.”

Whether the Climate Act drives the state’s high energy prices remains a subject of debate. A recent Public Service Commission report found that cost recovery for Climate Act measures accounted for anywhere from 5% to 9.5% of a residential customer’s monthly electric bill — but consistently 2% or less of their gas bill — in 2024.

Another factor contributing to higher rates has been large-scale improvements in gas infrastructure. Last year, residents in downstate New York experienced rate hikes when National Grid began a $5 billion system upgrade, which included replacing ​“leak-prone” pipes across the region.",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/GettyImages-2203085341.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=a990d02fba6305386b51364ddd7350d3,N,,2025-10-16 04:58:40.271173

READ: AI Data Centers Are Sending Consumer Electric Bills Soaring

Utility bills across the country have already been on the rise as the proliferation of AI data centers fuels a demand surge that’s raising prices for all consumers. In some regions, the cost of rebuilding infrastructure after extreme weather events is also driving up expenses.

The biggest increase is expecting in the South Atlantic region spanning Delaware to Florida, followed by New England. The rise in power costs come as households using propane or heating oil see some relief: Spending on propane is projected to fall 9%, and heating-oil expenditures 8%, supported by ample inventories and lower crude prices.

The U.S electric vehicle market size was valued at USD 48.03 billion in 2024 and is anticipated to reach USD 60.26 billion in 2025 to USD 369.88 billion by 2033, growing at a CAGR of 25.46% during the forecast period from 2025 to 2033.

The electric vehicle is a structural reconfiguration of mobility, infrastructure, and industrial identity. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, EVs accounted for 11.2% of all new light-duty vehicle sales in 2023, up from just 4.6% in 2020, yet only 38% of American households live within five miles of a DC fast charger, as mapped by the Department of Transportation’s National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Program.

MARKET DRIVERS

Corporate Fleet Electrification as a Supply Chain Imperative

The acceleration of EV adoption is orchestrated by corporate logistics and procurement mandates that treat electrification as an operational necessity, which is augmented in propelling the growth of the U.S. electric vehicle market. In 2023 alone, these fleets ordered more than 150,000 electric vans and trucks, surpassing retail EV sales in several months, as documented by the Electrification Coalition’s Fleet Adoption Tracker. These fleets operate on fixed routes, predictable schedules, and centralized charging hubs, making them ideal candidates for electrification long before individual buyers overcome range anxiety.

State-Level Zero-Emission Vehicle Mandates Reshaping Dealer Networks

California, New York, and Washington now enforce Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) mandates requiring automakers to sell increasing percentages of EVs or face financial penalties, which is leveraging the growth of TheS. Electric vehicle market. Automakers are responding not by expanding retail offerings, while Ford redirecting F-150 Lightning production to prioritize regions where compliance incentives outweigh federal tax credit delays. These mandates bypass consumer hesitation entirely, forcing manufacturers to build EVs even when demand lags.

MARKET RESTRAINTS

Charging Infrastructure Disparities and Grid Strain in Rural and Low-Income Communities

The EV charging in affluent urban corridors, which is leaving rural and low-income communities behind, is restricting the growth of the U.S. electric vehicle market. Simultaneously, grid operators in areas like Arizona and Texas report transformer overloads caused by clusters of home EV charging during evening peaks, prompting utilities to impose “EV connection moratoriums” in neighborhoods without substation upgrades. The EV transition risks deepening mobility inequality, which is turning clean transportation into a privilege of zip code rather than policy.

Battery Raw Material Dependency and Supply Chain Fragility

The dependence on foreign-sourced minerals is undermining its claim to energy sovereignty, which is quietly inhibiting the growth of the U.S. electric vehicle market. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, 78% of lithium and 62% of cobalt used in U.S.-assembled EV batteries are imported from China, Australia, and the Democratic Republic of Congo, while less than 1% of lithium refining occurs domestically. Even recycling infrastructure lags, as only 5% of end-of-life EV batteries are currently processed domestically, per the ReCell Center’s 2023 Recovery Report.

MARKET OPPORTUNITIES

Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) Integration as a Distributed Energy Resource

The electric vehicles are evolving from passive consumers into active grid assets through bidirectional charging systems that allow EVs to discharge stored energy back into homes or the grid during peak demand. The growing demand is ascribed to boosting the growth of the U.S. electric vehicle market to some extent. According to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, pilot programs in California and Vermont demonstrated that a single V2G-enabled EV can provide up to 8 kWh of backup power, enough to sustain a household for six hours during an outage. Meanwhile, Ford’s F-150 Lightning, now sold with Home Power Backup capability, has been integrated into utility demand-response programs in Texas, where owners earn $150/month for allowing their vehicles to feed power back during emergencies.

Industrial-Grade Charging Hubs as Economic Anchors in Declining Regions

The deployment of high-capacity EV charging stations along major freight corridors is becoming a catalyst for regional revitalization in economically distressed communities. Similarly, in Detroit, the city partnered with Electrify America to install 120 charging ports across abandoned auto plants, transforming shuttered industrial sites into mobility innovation zones with training centers for EV technicians. These hubs serve not just passenger vehicles, but delivery fleets, transit buses, and heavy-duty trucks sectors that are rapidly electrifying under federal mandates.

MARKET CHALLENGES

Cybersecurity Vulnerabilities in the Connected EV Ecosystem

GA's growing number of cyber threats, with the penetration of internet connectivity with EEVs, is merely a challenging factor for the growth of the U.S. electric vehicle market. According to the SAE International Cybersecurity Benchmark Report, 89% of EV models tested in 2023 had exploitable vulnerabilities in telematics systems, including unencrypted communication channels, default passwords in firmware, and remote access flaws that could allow hackers to disable brakes, lock doors, or drain batteries remotely. The threat is not theoretical, but a coordinated cyberattack targeting EV charging networks could trigger cascading grid failures, especially during peak demand events. The future of mobility is being wired without armor.

Consumer Perception Gap Between Cost of Ownership and Upfront Price

The persistent consumer resistance from the psychological dissonance between upfront price and long-term savings is expected to slow the growth of the U.S. electric vehicle market. Meanwhile, insurance premiums for EVs remain 18–22% higher than ICE vehicles due to repair complexity and parts scarcity, further eroding perceived value. The car may be cheaper to run, but the story hasn’t been told right.

REPORT COVERAGE

SEGMENT ANALYSIS

By Vehicle Insights

The passenger electric cars segment was the largest and held a dominant share of the U.S. EV market in 2024, with the environmental idealism, but in cultural familiarity and infrastructure accessibility, passenger EVs leverage existing residential charging networks and benefit from decades of automotive branding that equates ownership with personal identity. Tesla’s Model Y became the best-selling vehicle in America across all fuel types in Q4 2023, per Cox Automotive data, while Ford Mustang Mach-E and Chevrolet Bolt EV gained traction among middle-income households seeking tech-forward alternatives to gasoline sedans.

The commercial electric vehicles segment is likely to grow with a significant CAGR of 58.7% from 2025 to 2033. The U.S. Postal Service ordered 10,000 Oshkosh-built electric delivery vans in 2023 alone, which is a program that will replace 16% of its entire fleet by 2026, according to USPS Office of Inspector General reports. Walmart, FedEx, and UPS have collectively committed to over 200,000 EVs by 2030, creating predictable, large-scale demand that automakers prioritize over consumer models. These fleets operate on fixed routes, centralized depots, and predictable usage cycles by making them ideal candidates for electrification long before individual consumers overcome range anxiety. California was the top performer of the U.S. EV market by capturing 39.3% of share in 2024, with the nation’s most populous state and regulatory laboratory, making it the de facto proving ground for electrification policy.

COUNTRY ANALYSIS

Texas Market Analysis

Texas's electric vehicle market was positioned second by accounting for 11.4% of share in 2024. The state’s lack of income tax and expansive road networks make long-haul freight electrification economically viable, which is prompting companies like Lone Star Logistics to retrofit 500 electric semi-trucks for regional hauls, as noted by the Texas Clean Energy Coalition.

Throwing billions of taxpayer dollars at our failing coal stations, and repealing our Renewable Energy Targets, does nothing but scare away renewable energy investors at a time when we need new energy supply to drive down emissions and power bills.

The Crisafulli Government is playing Queenslanders for fools by pretending they’re going to keep their emission reduction promises while pledging to keep coal chugging along for decades.

Keeping coal power stations on taxpayer-funded life support and massively expanding polluting gas is incompatible with reducing emissions. The Crisafulli Government is not following through on their word to protect our communities and Great Barrier Reef from the worst impacts of climate change.

Climate change is already having significant impacts on hundreds of thousands of Queenslanders every year through more unnatural weather events. Without urgent action, it is likely that 6.5% of Queensland homes could be uninsurable by 2030.

Queensland’s electricity sector is responsible for 34%, or the lion’s share, of the state’s climate pollution. It’s vital to repower our energy system with renewable energy backed by storage in order to underpin the decarbonisation in other sectors, like transport.

India’s Robust Push Toward Electric Mobility India EV market is growing at unprecedented speed.","China has officially filed a complaint against India at the World Trade Organisation (WTO), alleging that New Delhi’s electric vehicle (EV) and battery manufacturing subsidies give domestic companies an unfair advantage over global competitors. The dispute marks a new flashpoint in the fast-growing global EV industry. The use of WTO mechanisms by China, ironically seen as one of the biggest backers of subsidies for domestic industry will not be missed by anyone.

China’s Complaint and Its Concerns

According to reports, China’s Ministry of Commerce has warned that it will take “firm measures” to protect the rights of Chinese EV manufacturers. Beijing claims that India’s extensive incentive programmes - ranging from EV production subsidies to concessional tax benefits - distort the playing field for Chinese automakers considering entry into the Indian market.

The complaint comes at a time when India is planning to create a National Critical Mineral Stockpile (NCMS). The NCMS aims to secure long-term access to essential rare earth elements used in EV batteries, solar panels, and wind turbines. This initiative follows China’s recent restrictions on exporting key minerals, a move that has intensified global efforts to diversify supply chains away from Beijing.

Under WTO rules, India now has 30 days to enter consultations with China to resolve the issue. If both nations fail to reach an agreement, China can request the formation of a dispute settlement panel to adjudicate the case.

EV Overcapacity and China’s Expanding Push Abroad

China’s EV industry has developed rapidly over the past decade with strong state support, including subsidies, tax rebates, and consumer incentives. In a now familiar templete, domestic capacities have been bult to serve the global market, leading to serious overcapacity issues as countries have sought to block cheaper Chinese entrants. On top of that , as China's domestic market slows and production capacity outpaces demand, many Chinese automakers, such as BYD, face a massive challange without access to newer, significant markets. Interestingly, the recent report by AlixPartners noted that only 15 out of the 129 electric vehicle (EV) and plug-in hybrid brands currently operating in China are expected to remain financially viable by 2030.

India, with its vast consumer base and growing clean mobility ecosystem, presents an attractive opportunity. However, India’s increasing protection for domestic manufacturing and preference for local value addition have raised concerns for foreign firms attempting to compete on equal terms.

India’s Robust Push Toward Electric Mobility

India EV market is growing at unprecedented speed. In FY 2024–25, electric two‑wheeler sales reached 11.49 lakh units, up 21 percent from the previous year. This expansion is being built on the back of several government schemes designed to make India a hub for clean transportation and advanced battery manufacturing.

Government Incentives Driving Growth

FAME Phase-I & National Electric Mobility Mission Plan (NEMMP) 2020:

FAME India Scheme (Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid and Electric Vehicles) was implemented from 2015 to 2019 to encourage the adoption of electric and hybrid vehicles. Under the first phase of FAME (Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid and Electric Vehicles), more than 2.55 lakh EVs were supported, along with the development of essential charging infrastructure.

National Electric Mobility Mission Plan (NEMMP) 2020 was launched to accelerate EV production and adoption.

FAME India Phase‑II:

Introduced in April 2019 with a budget of ₹11,500 crore, this scheme boosted EV adoption on a national scale. As of June 2025, 16.29 lakh vehicles have received support under FAME II. The programme also focused on strengthening India’s electric bus network and expanding fast‑charging facilities.

PLI Schemes for EVs and Batteries:

The Production Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme for the automobile sector, worth ₹25,938 crore, incentivizes domestic manufacturing of Advanced Automotive Technologies (AAT). By March 2025, investments under this scheme exceeded ₹29,500 crore. Participation requires at least 50% domestic value addition to qualify for the incentives.

Another major initiative—the PLI Scheme for Advanced Chemistry Cell (ACC) Battery Storage—targets local manufacturing capacity of 50 GWh by leveraging ₹18,100 crore in investment support. As of February 2025, 40 GWh of projects have been awarded.

PM Electric Drive Revolution in Innovative Vehicle Enhancement (PM E-DRIVE):

Approved in September 2024 and implemented till March 2028 with ₹10,900 crore, this comprehensive scheme provides direct subsidies to consumers. As of July 2025:

The document warns that the PJM region — which serves roughly 65 million customers and is the country’s largest energy region — must deploy at least 16 GW of energy storage by 2032 and 23 GW by 2040 in order to maintain grid reliability. Without such build-out, the region risks forced load shedding during extreme weather, sharp increases in electricity costs (projected ~ 38% by 2028), and broader reliability challenges. Furthermore, the group notes that hundreds of energy storage projects are currently stalled in PJM’s interconnection queue, with regulatory, permitting, and market design barriers delaying critical deployment.

Energy storage is positioned as a bridging technology that complements most renewable generation by delivering dispatchable power during peak demand, smoothing variability, and helping avoid costly infrastructure overbuild. The report urges state and PJM policymakers to streamline interconnection processes, reform market rules to properly value storage services, clarify transmission charge allocations, and modernize permitting standards.

For Maryland counties, the expansion of energy storage carries direct and growing implications. Storage projects can help stabilize local grids and reduce strain on distribution infrastructure. Still, these systems come with new public safety risks, and should they fail, they can create a serious local or regional crisis. As state and regional policymakers consider wider adoption of these technologies, county leaders should stay engaged to ensure legislative or regulatory frameworks adequately meet local needs and concerns.",https://i0.wp.com/conduitstreet.mdcounties.org/wp-content/uploads/electricity-energy.jpg?fit=1920%2C1280&ssl=1,N,,2025-10-16 05:58:14.303519

Here's What We Got Instead - InsideEVs,Kevin Williams,,,,,https://insideevs.com/news/775910/nacs-story-experience-kia-leaf/,"This is kind of the whole reason why we’ve got a switch en masse to Tesla’s power plug, known as the North American Charging Standard (NACS).

After all, Tesla had successfully convinced its customers that its cars and charging network came with almost no compromises—that they could be used just like gas vehicles. And if other EVs couldn’t offer the same experience, they were essentially destined to fail.

This is kind of the whole reason why we’ve got a switch en masse to Tesla’s power plug, known as the North American Charging Standard (NACS). A few deals and handshakes a couple of years ago, and now virtually every EV brand has made the switch to the plug, with the goal of gaining access to Tesla’s Supercharger network.

Charging could then be seamless, everywhere, powered by a slimmer plug instead of a bulky CCS unit, and actually work on the first attempt. Finally, I wouldn’t have to hear anyone say they’d never buy an EV until they could use the “Tesla Plug”. Here you go, damn you, every collective automaker told consumers who were on the fence about buying an EV. We even gave it a big award here at InsideEVs last year.

And yet, as the initial crop of NACS-equipped cars makes their way to roads, and we get our hands on them for more than just an afternoon drive, I don’t know if the change was as dramatic as everyone insisted it’d be. This month, I’ve driven three cars with native NACS plugs: the Lucid Gravity, the 2026 Nissan Leaf and the updated Kia EV6. And I am not convinced that NACS is the lifesaver we thought it would be.

In fact, it made things a bit harder.

My first run-in with native NACS outside of Tesla came via the new Kia EV6 facelift. It’s not just a new plug, either. Kia went out of its way to make sure it’s Tesla Supercharger-ready, moving the rear-mounted port from the passenger side to the driver’s side, like on a Model Y or a Model 3.

I had the EV6 press tester delivered from Detroit to Ohio, where I live. And as I usually do, I asked the fleet drivers not to recharge it during the trip so I could do my own 10% to 80% charging test later.

Yet, about 45 minutes before the EV6 was to show up at my door, I got a call.

The driver of the EV6 got nervous. About 30 miles away from my house, he called asking if I knew of a place where he could charge. He was at about 21%, enough to make it to my front door, but I can understand why the lack of range would cause trepidation for a fleet driver driving freeway speeds.

After a short conversation, I ascertained that either Kia or the fleet company itself had only given him a NACS to J1772 charging adapter. That would allow him to plug the EV6 into any slower, Level 2 charger, but he’d need a different adapter to use a non-Tesla DC fast-charger—and he didn’t have one.

There was a Tesla supercharging station somewhat on his journey, but he had no Tesla app account and would have needed to pay with a special corporate card that wasn’t set up for Tesla Supercharging.

I told him to take it slow and continue to drive. With luck, he got the EV6 to me at 8%; not bad, but I can only imagine how nerve-racking that was.

This may sound like a narrow and very specific use case, the kind of thing that won’t happen to most EV drivers. In reality, it’s more of the same: be prepared. Know where your stations are. Make sure you have the right equipment, which in this case is various adapters. Is that really any easier than before? Plus, there’s the fact that not all Tesla Supercharger stations are open to all non-Tesla EVs; you won’t know this until you fire up the app, but many stations remain exclusive to the home team.

While in my possession, the EV6 was locked out of all my traditional DC fast charging test spots, forcing me to either go significantly out of my way to a new Ionna charging station or use a Tesla Supercharger. Also, the EV6’s famously high charging speeds are limited when using the Supercharger; tack on an extra 10 to 15 minutes of charging time if you do.

Most drivers do (and should) use Level 2 charging, either at home or in public, and reconfiguring a car’s charging port to cater to what is kind of a niche experience for most EV owners seems weird. I shudder to picture the confusion of a NACS-native car that pulls up to a J1772 Level 2 charging station from ChargePoint or something, only to realize they can’t plug in.

It sounds silly, but stuff like this adds friction and points of pain and confusion for drivers. We’re already having issues getting people to buy these things in the first place, so this just seems like it would make it worse.

It appears that on some level, Nissan agrees with me, too. The latest 2026 Nissan Leaf famously has two ports: a Tesla NACS-port for DC fast charging on one side, but also a J1772 port for Level 2 charging on the other side. It’s weird, and clearly a stopgap meant to satiate the new NACS-native push that came as a prerequisite for access to the Tesla Supercharging network.

But Nissan kept the standard port on purpose. “If you look at Level 1, Level 2 charging, the most common ports are the J1772. So instead of delaying the vehicle to be able to have AC and DC commonized into one port, we decided that in this transition period that it would be best for the customer to just have both,” said Jeff Tessmer, a senior R&D engineer at Nissan.

And he’s right. I miss my Mitsubishi i-MiEV, but my example famously did not have any DC fast charging. (Believe it or not, that was an optional add-on, once.) Before my car went to the great big graveyard in the sky, it did 75% of my daily driving. I had a routine of known charging stations that I’d frequent; Level 2 was always enough for my driving needs, since the car would be sitting for hours. I’d wager that smartly-placed Level 2 charging stations would be all anyone ever needs, save for the one-off road trip where DC fast charging would come into play.

Now, this isn’t just me deriding NACS. I think the plug shape itself has a significantly more ergonomic design compared to the bulky and unwieldy CCS. Most NACS plugs I’ve used are dead simple and easy to plug in.

And this also, unfortunately, highlights the advantage Tesla still has with charging. It’s one plug that does it all, from Destination to Superchargers. I suspect the vast majority of Tesla owners only really ever mess with J1772 adapters sometimes. Why bother with CCS when you have Superchargers everywhere? For the rest of us, we’ll still be stuck in App and Adapter Hell a bit longer.

I just am not convinced this will be the industry-saving innovation that brands and EV enthusiasts really think it will be. Sure, thousands of drivers now have access to Tesla Supercharging, but I’d wager that most real EV drivers won’t really ever use them. Because you kind of don’t need it.

1st Gear: Stellantis makes huge investment that'll add 5,000 U.S. jobs

Stellantis is on the verge of a massive investment in the U.S.: $13 billion over the next four years. That money is set to go toward increasing stateside manufacturing output by 50%, supporting five new vehicles, and a new engine. It's also supposed to add about 5,000 new manufacturing jobs in Illinois, Ohio, Michigan, and Indiana.

The Transatlantic automaker is billing this as the largest investment in the company's 100-year history. Stellantis says it plans to reopen an Illinois assembly plant in 2027, where it will build the new Jeep Compass and Cherokee. It has been offline since 2023. Both vehicles were previously slated to be built outside the U.S. It's also going to start building Ram pickups in Toledo, Ohio, starting in 2028. Here's what else the plan holds, from Automotive News:

The plan also calls for factory upgrades to prepare for a new large SUV in Warren, Mich., the next-generation Dodge Durango in Detroit and a new four-cylinder engine in Kokomo, Ind. The UAW previously had expressed concern that Durango production would leave the U.S.

[...]

Stellantis' $13 billion total includes R&D spending and supplier costs. After Filosa became CEO in June, he set a ""clear priority"" for his team to grow the company in the U.S., where sales and profits had been declining.

[...]

The product launches announced Oct. 14 ""will be in addition to a regular cadence of 19 refreshed products across all U.S. assembly plants and updated powertrains planned through 2029,"" Stellantis said.

The company plans to invest $600 million to reopen the Belvidere Assembly Plant in Illinois to produce the Cherokee and Compass for the U.S., with one nameplate starting in 2027 and the other in 2028. This will create about 3,300 new jobs.

Both nameplates were previously made in Belvidere, with the Compass moving to Mexico in 2016 and the Cherokee being discontinued when the plant was idled in 2023.

When Belvidere reopens, Filosa said it will be the primary source of Cherokees and Compasses for the U.S. Stellantis no longer plans to make the redesigned Compass in Brampton, Ontario, after halting work to retool the Canadian plant in February.

This has some folks up north — especially the Canadian Unifor auto union — worried that jobs are going to be lost at the Brampton plant, former home of the 300C, but Filosa says that there are plans for the factory, and they will be shared ""upon further discussions with the Canadian government.""

Oh, if you thought I was done laying out all of the planned expenditures, you've got another thing coming, buddy.

Nearly $400 million is going toward assembly of the new midsize pickup in Ohio, joining the Jeep Wrangler and Gladiator. Stellantis said it would add 900 jobs in Toledo to make the truck there, and it plans to continue with investments in Toledo that it announced previously.

In Michigan, the Warren Truck Assembly Plant will make a new SUV, available as either a range-extended electric vehicle or a gasoline-powered model, starting in 2028, Stellantis said. The project will cost nearly $100 million and add more than 900 jobs at the plant in suburban Detroit.

The company said it will invest $130 million to prepare the Detroit Assembly Complex – Jefferson plant for the next-generation Durango, reaffirming a commitment from January. Production is expected to launch in 2029.

Stellantis also confirmed a January announcement to make upgrades at several Kokomo, Ind., plants for a new four-cylinder engine to be made starting in 2026. The automaker said it will add more than 100 jobs and invest more than $100 million ""to ensure that the U.S. will be the manufacturing home of this strategic powertrain.""

Listen, this all sounds very promising. It's not like Stellantis was ever going to turn itself around if it didn't spend big to get itself out of the hole it dug. However, it really needs to focus on the products it puts out now. It needs to build vehicles that people actually want to buy. If it can do that, $15 billion will be more than worth it. If it can't, well, things could get very rocky.

2nd Gear: Global EV and PHEV sales top 2.1 million units in September

In September, people across the globe loudly declared, ""I want an electric vehicle or plug-in hybrid, and I want it now!"" Combined sales of the two types of vehicles rose 26% from the same month last year to a record 2.1 million vehicles — driven mostly by strong demand in China and a late push in the U.S. as folks looked to take advantage of the expiring $7,500 EV tax credit, according to market research firm Rho Motion.

The nearly 1.3 million sales in China accounted for about two-thirds of global EV sales, but North America also hit a record as U.S. buyers flocked to dealers to take advantage of that sweet, sweet deal before President Trump and his Republican buddies ripped it away from them. From Reuters:

September, typically China's busiest month for car buying, saw sales rise as shoppers looked to make the most of trade-in subsidies before some regions started phasing them out.

U.S. demand reflected a surge as buyers rushed to claim the expiring $7,500 EV tax credit, although demand is expected to decline sharply in the fourth quarter ""as both consumers and businesses lose access to the federal incentives that have underpinned EV purchases"", Rho Motion said.

Europe also hit a new high, helped by incentives in Germany and strong demand in Britain, while Tesla's rollout of a lower-cost Model Y in Europe is expected to further intensify competition in coming months.

All in all, European sales jumped 36% to 427,541 vehicles, and North American sales were up a nearly astonishing 66% to about 215,000 vehicles. Of course, China blew everyone else out of the water with its 1.3 million sales, but the rest of the world did pretty well too: a 48% increase to 153,594 vehicles.

3rd Gear: Rimac wants a bigger piece of Bugatti with possible Porsche buyout

Mate Rimac, the founder of the Croatian hypercar maker that bears his name, says he's in talks to buy out Porsche's stake in their joint venture Bugatti Rimac by next year. Currently, the 37-year-old is the single biggest shareholder of his Rimac Group. His company and Porsche set up Bugatti Rimac in 2021 to make hypercars under the Bugatti brand. He says Porsche had earlier tried to take majority control. From Bloomberg:

""I just want to be able to make long-term decisions, to make long-term investments and to do things in a different way, without having to explain to 50 people,"" he said in an interview in Singapore.

[...]

Rimac made a preliminary offer for Porsche's 45% stake that valued the joint venture at slightly over €1 billion ($1.1 billion), people familiar with the matter said in April.

Now, Rimac said he wants to take over the joint venture and has investors behind him to close the transaction. He cited an unnamed international investor group and private equity funds.

[...]

""When you negotiate with a corporate, there's so many factors,"" Rimac said. ""It's families, it's multiple families. It's an emotional topic.""

Private equity is always a little bit scary (as I'm sure you know, given Jalopnik's history), but if there's one guy I trust to keep a brand moving in the right direction, it's Rimac. If the Tourbillon is any indication of where things are headed, the automaker is in very good hands.

4th Gear: Ah-hoo, Waymos of London

Alphabet's robotaxi company, Waymo, is planning to launch its fully driverless ride-hailing service in London sometime in 2026, according to the firm. It has grown slowly but steadily in the U.S., but as it picks up pace over here, it seems poised to make the jump internationally to one of the most congested cities in the world. From Reuters:

Earlier this year, Waymo started collecting data in Tokyo, Japan and testing its vehicles operated by human drivers in cooperation with Japanese taxi firm Nihon Kotsu and with Go, which operates a mobile app for hailing taxi rides.

In London, Waymo said it will collaborate with vehicle financing firm Moove as it prepares for the rollout, and is actively engaging with local and national regulators to secure necessary approvals.

Waymo vehicles are now on the way to London, where safety drivers will start testing the vehicles before fully autonomous operations begin next year, a Waymo spokesperson said.

[...]

Waymo has partnered with Moove to handle its fleet operations, facilities and charging infrastructure in Phoenix and next year in Miami, Florida.

Ride-hailing firm Uber, which offers Waymo vehicles on its app in Atlanta and Austin, announced in June plans to trial fully driverless rides in the UK from spring 2026 through its partnership with AI startup Wayve.

Waymo currently takes riders on over a quarter million paid trips every single week with about 1,500 vehicles in U.S. cities like San Francisco, Los Angeles, Phoenix, Arizona, Atlanta, Georgia, and Austin.

,North Carolina American Energy ,2025-10-16 04:29:19+00:00,EurekAlert!,"Electric power could bring paper mills to net zero emissions October 15, 2025 Joey Pitchford ...",Not Available,,,,,https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1102120,"A study finds that replacing natural gas with electric and biomass power, along with improved energy efficiency, could help some pulp and paper mills reach zero net emissions.
Doing so could have trade-offs when it comes to energy production on site, however.
The effectiveness of the method changed depending on whether or not the mill was integrated, but all types saw reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.
Integrated mills benefitted significantly from replacing their limited fossil fuel usage with biomass, especially when electricity costs exceeded that of natural gas.
The authors acknowledge support for this work from the Alliance for Pulp & Paper Technology Innovation (APPTI) consortium, which is supported by leading pulp and paper producers and their associated team members.","A study finds that replacing natural gas with electric and biomass power, along with improved energy efficiency, could help some pulp and paper mills reach zero net emissions.

Researchers began with a simulation of mills defined by two characteristics: whether they used virgin or recycled fibers, and whether they were integrated or not. A virgin mill creates pulp and paper from fresh wood that is being used for the first time, while a recycled fiber mill re-uses readily available fibers which may have been previously processed. A mill is considered integrated if it has the capability to turn wood and other biomass into pulp and paper on site, whereas a non-integrated mill uses pulp that has been produced and dried off site.

“When looking at decarbonization, most prior studies have looked at one product or one type of mill,” said Lokendra Pal, co-author of the study and professor in the Department of Forest Biomaterials and the Department of Mechanical & Aerospace Engineering at NC State. “By building a whole-mill simulation for each of these four categories, we can capture the relative strengths and weaknesses of each. Mixing these different variables lets us understand the tradeoffs and interdependencies of operations in far more detail than has previously been available.”

Virgin integrated mills account for 30% of annual U.S. paper production and 33 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, the largest shares of both between the four types of mills. While these mills produce between 80 and 90% of their energy using waste wood sourced on site, they also typically include a natural gas boiler to provide the remaining necessary energy. Non-integrated mills, on the other hand, do not produce energy on site and rely entirely on natural gas boilers and purchased electricity for heating and drying during the paper-making process. Taken together, the paper industry accounts for 6% of the total U.S. industrial energy consumption, making it the fourth-largest industrial energy consumer.

Researchers found that by moving to electric-powered boilers, these mills could reduce their emissions by as much as 61%, potentially reaching zero net emissions. Doing so would require changes in how electricity is produced, Pal said, so that emissions from electricity production would not cancel out reductions at the mill.

“The electric system in the United States is expected to increase its share of clean and renewable energy by 2050, which would make boilers powered by that electricity much cleaner than using natural gas,” he said. “What we’ve found is that there is a path toward zero emissions for these mills, but only if that progress is made in the electrical grid.”

Researchers also examined the decarbonization effects of using energy-efficient dewatering methods like enzymatic treatments and mechanical presses to remove excess water before the thermal drying process. Drying traditionally involves jetting wet pulp on a moving wire, removing most of the water by gravity and vacuum, and then transferring the wet paper web to press rollers which mechanically squeeze out more water before the paper is passed around steam-heated metal cylinders to boil and evaporate the rest. This heating method, known as thermal drying, is the most energy-intensive part of the papermaking process.

Increasing the water removal during pressing resulted in significant energy savings and reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, said Maria E. Gonzalez, lead author and Ph.D. student in the Department of Forest Biomaterials at NC State. Doing so could have trade-offs when it comes to energy production on site, however.

“We found that each 1% of water removed before drying translated to a 3% increase in total energy efficiency for the papermaking process. However, it also meant less steam production, which is used to power turbines,” said González. “Mill operations are often interdependent, so if you change one process it may impact others. We are trying to overcome the interdependency by offering multiple strategies for mills to pick and choose from.”

The final strategy researchers analyzed was the use of low-carbon alternatives, like using waste wood in boilers instead of fossil fuels. The effectiveness of the method changed depending on whether or not the mill was integrated, but all types saw reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.

Integrated mills benefitted significantly from replacing their limited fossil fuel usage with biomass, especially when electricity costs exceeded that of natural gas. They could also opt to supplement the steam used for powering their turbines with biomass combustion. Overall, this method showed decarbonization rates of between 24 and 48%, depending on how completely the mill replaced its fossil fuels. While these numbers do not reach the emission reductions gained from full electrification, biomass is also a readily available fuel source which could provide mills with higher energy independence, Pal said.

“Looking at all three of these strategies together is a significant step toward improving the sustainability and competitive edge of the U.S. pulp and paper industry,” Pal said. “Trade-offs like this appear no matter what strategy or strategies you use. There is no one-size-fits-all answer to sustainability.”

The paper, “Advancing sustainability in the U.S. pulp and paper industry: Decarbonization through energy efficiency, electrification, low-carbon fuels, and the social cost of emissions,” is published in the Journal of Cleaner Production.

These electric vehicles have been discontinued so far for the 2026 model year: Acura ZDX, Genesis Electrified G80 and Nissan Ariya.

Plans for these electrified vehicles have been scrapped: Dodge Charger Daytona SRT Banshee, Ford three-row SUV, Honda three-row SUV, Jeep Gladiator 4xe, Nissan electric sedans, the all-electric Ram 1500 REV and the Volkswagen ID.7.

Slow sales, impending tariffs and a shifting EV landscape are to blame for many of the canceled models and trims.

The year 2025 has not been a calm or stable one for electrified vehicles. The Trump administration’s EV-negative policies have spelled the death of the $7,500 federal EV tax credit, and demand for these vehicles has taken a hit, too. The uncertain market combined with impending tariffs has majorly affected automakers’ short- and long-term product and manufacturing plans, and some EVs planned to debut in the next couple of years have been scrapped. Below is a list of EVs that we won’t get to see, as well as the current EVs that have been discontinued for the 2026 model year.

These Current EVs Are Discontinued

Acura ZDX

Acura’s all-electric ZDX SUV has been discontinued after just one model year. It’s not the first time, either; the original gas-powered ZDX lasted only for four model years and was more popular than the EV version. The ZDX was the only EV in Acura’s lineup, but it won’t be the last, as the brand plans to launch a new EV based on the RSX Prototype.

Genesis Electrified G80

After a short three-model-year run, the Genesis Electrified G80 sedan has been canceled for the U.S. despite a refreshed-for-2026 version planned for global markets. The Electrified G80 was built in South Korea, so it wasn’t eligible for any tax credits but could be caught in the tariff crossfire due to its foreign production.

Slow sales are also to blame: According to Automotive News, the luxury electric sedan’s monthly sales are down 77% compared to last year, with only 10 Electrified G80’s sold in July.

Nissan Ariya

Nissan teased the arrival of its Ariya electric SUV for more years than it actually existed. Nissan decided to axe the Ariya EV after just three model years due to weak sales, ongoing import tariffs and the end of the $7,500 federal EV tax credit. The Ariya joined the Leaf in the automaker’s EV lineup but never achieved much popularity, and even though Nissan cut prices, inspiring some sales growth in the first half of 2025, production is ending for the model.

These Electrified Vehicles Will Never Get a Chance

Dodge Charger Daytona SRT Banshee

While the Dodge Charger Daytona soldiers on into 2026, the electric muscle car’s trim lineup has been gutted with the cancellation of the base Daytona R/T variant as well as the range-topping SRT Banshee trim. The SRT Banshee was supposed to sport an 800-volt battery architecture, two-speed transmission and lightning-quick acceleration, but in a total lineup reversal, Dodge is instead adding more V-8s to its stable in place of EVs. According to Mopar Insiders, slow Charger Daytona sales, softening EV demand and consumer backlash have prompted the brand to pull back on its EV strategy.

Ford 3-Row Electric SUV

For a while, the Kia EV9 and related Hyundai Ioniq 9 were the only mainstream three-row all-electric SUVs out there — and it looks like they’ll continue to corner that market in the short term, as Ford’s planned three-row electric SUV competitor has been canceled. InsideEVs reports that the automaker announced it would initially delay the 350-mile battery-powered SUV but has now decided to kill production and shift its strategy to include more hybrids.

“In addition to adjusting the cadence of product launches and realigning battery sourcing, Ford now plans to leverage hybrid technologies for its next three-row SUVs,” the automaker said in a statement.

Honda 3-Row Electric SUV

Similarly, Honda’s electric family hauler also won’t see production due to a shift away from a planned EV-heavy lineup and toward more hybrids. InsideEVs reports that the three-row SUV was likely to be based off the Honda 0 Prototypes, which debuted at the 2024 Consumer Electronics Show. For now, Honda will continue to offer just one EV, the two-row Prologue SUV developed in partnership with GM.

Jeep Gladiator 4xe

The plug-in hybrid version of Jeep’s Gladiator pickup truck has gone to the big off-road park in the sky. Jeep announced the Gladiator 4xe in September 2024 and promised a late-2025 on-sale date; however, as with the Charger Daytona SRT Banshee cancellation, Jeep cited weakening EV demand as well as slow Gladiator sales as reasons to pull the plug, per InsideEVs. For now, there are two 4xe plug-ins left in Jeep’s lineup: the Wrangler and Grand Cherokee models, with the range-extended Grand Wagoneer on the way.

Nissan Electric Sedans

Nissan is canceling plans to make a pair of electric sedans, according to Automotive News. With softening EV demand compounded by a steep decline in sedan sales, it’s not surprising that the automaker put these cars on the shelf. This comes on the heels of Nissan announcing the cancellation of its 2026 Ariya compact electric SUV due to slowing EV sales, ongoing import tariffs and the end of the EV tax credit. The redesigned 2026 Leaf will be the only electric Nissan on sale in the U.S. for the new model year.

Ram 1500 REV

Stellantis (Alfa Romeo, Dodge, Fiat, Jeep and Ram’s parent company) has a third vehicle on this list. Ram has canceled the all-electric 1500 REV pickup truck. The Ford F-150 Lightning challenger was expected to have two battery options that offered 350-500 miles of estimated max range. In January, Ram announced that only the 350-mile-range version would be coming when the pickup made its debut for 2026. Now, the automaker is canceling plans altogether.

“As demand for full-size battery-electric trucks slows in North America, Stellantis is reassessing its product strategy and will discontinue development of a full-size BEV pickup,” the automaker said in a statement. Instead, Ram will focus on a range-extended electric pickup, which uses a gas generator in addition to a battery and has now been renamed the, well, 1500 REV.

Volkswagen ID.7

Volkswagen has long teased the arrival of its mid-size electric sedan, but it turns out the ID.7 is a no-show. It was supposed to go on sale in 2025 with 300-plus miles of range and go head-to-head with the Hyundai Ioniq 6. But according to Fast Company, the cancellation just affects the North American market; the ID.7 has already launched in both Europe and China. With the ID.7 out, Volkswagen’s EV lineup shrinks to just two models: the ID.4 electric SUV and ID. Buzz minivan.

EPA Requests Comment On Draft Risk Evaluation For D4: On September 17, 2025, EPA announced the availability of and requested public comment on a draft risk evaluation under TSCA for cctamethylcyclotetrasiloxane (cyclotetrasiloxane, 2,2,4,4,6,6,8,8-octamethyl-) (D4). 90 Fed. Reg. 44821. EPA notes that the purpose of risk evaluations under TSCA is to determine whether a chemical substance presents an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment under the conditions of use (COU), including unreasonable risk to potentially exposed or susceptible subpopulations identified as relevant to the risk evaluation by EPA, and without consideration of costs or non-risk factors. EPA states that it used the best available science to prepare the draft risk evaluation and to determine preliminarily, based on the weight of scientific evidence, that D4 poses unreasonable risk to human health and the environment driven primarily by certain COUs analyzed in the draft risk evaluation. EPA will hold two virtual public meetings of the Science Advisory Committee on Chemicals (SACC): on November 18, 2025, a preparatory meeting for SACC to consider the scope and clarity of the draft charge questions for the peer review; and on December 2-5, 2025, a peer review meeting for SACC to consider the D4 draft risk evaluation, technical support documents, and public comment. 90 Fed Reg. 45204. Written comments on the draft risk evaluation, technical support documents, and charge questions that will be provided to SACC for the peer review are due November 4, 2025. Comments on the draft risk evaluation are due November 17, 2025.

On October 9, 2025, EPA requested comments on candidates being considered as peer reviewers assisting SACC in its peer review of the draft D4 risk evaluation. Comments on the candidates are due October 23, 2025.

EPA Will Prioritize Review Of New Chemicals Intended For Use In Data Center Projects: EPA announced on September 18, 2025, that it will prioritize the review of submissions for new chemicals that are intended for use in data center projects or in the manufacturing of covered components, in each case, which pertain to a data center project that is a qualifying project, as defined by Executive Order (EO) 14318, “Accelerating Federal Permitting of Data Center Infrastructure.” EPA states that new chemical manufacturers may also seek to prioritize the review of a new chemical under the directives of the EO if the chemical has such an intended use. To help companies determine if their chemical and intended use qualify for prioritized review, EPA has provided instructions for the best way for submitters to make their request and provide necessary information to support the request. According to EPA, companies with new chemicals qualifying for prioritized review can identify their submission as a chemical intended for use in a data center project or for the manufacturing of covered components by submitting a cover letter through the Central Data Exchange (CDX) with their new chemical submission identifying the use and the data center where the new chemical or covered component will be used.

EPA Proposes To Amend TSCA Risk Evaluation Framework: On September 23, 2025, EPA proposed highly anticipated amendments to the procedural framework rule for conducting existing chemical risk evaluations under TSCA. 90 Fed. Reg. 45690. Comments on the proposed rule are due November 7, 2025. EPA states that under the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA), “comments on the information collection provisions are best assured of consideration if the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) receives a copy of your comments on or before October 23, 2025.” The proposed rule is well crafted and the changes to the risk evaluation framework are unsurprising. For more information on the amendments and our commentary, please read the full memorandum.

EPA Announces Settlements With Four Companies To Improve TRI Reporting: EPA announced on September 30, 2025, that it took action against four companies in New York, New Jersey, and Puerto Rico for failing to report the use of hazardous chemicals, as required by the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA). According to EPA, the settlements strengthen community safety by ensuring companies comply with the Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) program, “help[ing] neighborhoods stay informed about potentially dangerous substances nearby.” The settlements include the following companies:

New Jersey Galvanizing and Tinning Works (Newark, New Jersey): Failed to report nickel usage for three consecutive years. An EPA inspection in August 2024 led to a settlement of $63,800. The Company also certified its current compliance and agreed to adopt a compliance plan to help ensure future compliance;

US Polychemical Corporation (Chestnut Ridge, New York): Exceeded reporting thresholds and failed to report for glycol ethers and nonylphenol ethoxylates over three years. The Company certified its current compliance and will pay a $39,800 penalty, as well as implement a compliance plan to avoid future violations;

L.D. McCauley, LLC. (Orchard Park, New York): Did not report nitrate compounds for 2020 and 2021. After an EPA review, the Company certified to its current compliance, agreed to pay a $45,400 penalty, and will implement improved compliance measures; and

Quality Electroplating Corporation (Caguas, Puerto Rico): Submitted late reports for zinc compounds and provided inaccurate data for nitric acid and cyanide compounds. The Company certified to its current compliance, agreed to pay a penalty of $22,900, and created and will implement a plan to stay in compliance.

EPA Releases Meeting Minutes And Final SACC Report On Phthalates: EPA announced on October 6, 2025, that it released the meeting minutes and final report from the August 4-8, 2025, SACC virtual public meeting to discuss the draft risk evaluations and associated materials for the five phthalates that are currently undergoing risk evaluation under TSCA. The five phthalates are dibutyl phthalate (DBP), di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), butyl benzyl phthalate (BBP), diisobutyl phthalate (DIBP), and dicyclohexyl phthalate (DCHP). SACC peer reviewed technical support documents for all five phthalates, the draft risk evaluations for DCHP (released January 2025), and DBP and DEHP (both released June 2025). SACC also peer reviewed a draft carcinogenicity assessment and a draft cumulative risk analysis for the five phthalates. EPA states that it is in the process of reviewing feedback from the meeting, including the final report, and will use this feedback, along with feedback received from the public, to inform the final risk evaluations for DBP, DEHP, BBP, DIBP, and DCHP.

EPA Adds Additional PFAS To TRI: EPA announced on October 7, 2025, the addition of a per- and polyfluoroalkyl substance (PFAS) to the list of chemicals covered by the TRI. EPA added sodium perfluorohexanesulfonate (PFHxS-Na) to the TRI list pursuant to the Fiscal Year 2020 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). EPA states that the addition is due to EPA issuing a final toxicity value in 2025 entitled “IRIS Toxicological Review of Perfluorohexanesulfonic Acid (PFHxS, CASRN 335-46-4) and Related Salts.” EPA notes that the TRI chemical list already includes PFHxS and some of the salts identified in the assessment, but that PFHxS-Na, which is also identified in the assessment, was not on the TRI list. Accordingly, per the framework for automatic additions of PFAS provided in the 2020 NDAA, the publication of this assessment adds PFHxS-Na to the TRI list with an effective date of January 1, 2026, bringing the total number of PFAS subject to TRI reporting to 206.

Senate Committee Holds Hearing On Nomination Of Douglas Troutman To Be EPA Assistant Administrator For Toxic Substances: On October 8, 2025, the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works held a hearing on the nominations of Ho Nieh to be a member of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and Douglas Troutman to be Assistant Administrator for Toxic Substances of EPA. According to the Committee’s October 8, 2025, press release, Troutman agreed that the issue with new chemical reviews is both timeliness and outcomes. Troutman noted that “there are new resources coming to the office of chemical safety and pollution prevention, both in new team members, but also in additional resources, such as technological resources, IT resources, which we appreciate from Congress to speed up those reviews and to make sure they are done in a timely manner.” Troutman testified that he would work with Congress on bipartisan legislation to address gaps where the current implementation of TSCA has fallen short.

Comments On Final Risk Management Rule For Carbon Tetrachloride Are Due November 10, 2025: EPA announced on October 9, 2025, that it is beginning a 30-day comment period on its 2024 final risk management rule for carbon tetrachloride (CTC). 90 Fed. Reg. 48203. As reported in our January 13, 2025, memorandum, EPA published the final rule on December 11, 2024. After the final rule was published, several legal challenges were filed and then consolidated in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. EPA states that it “has since determined that the CTC final rule should be reconsidered through further rulemaking.” EPA invites public comment on all aspects of the final rule, “including but not limited to any existing or anticipated implementation issues associated with the final rule requirements, experiences with the CTC final rule since it went into effect, and whether the agency should consider additional or alternative measures or approaches to address the unreasonable risk presented by CTC under the conditions of use.” Comments are due November 10, 2025. More information is available in our October 15, 2025, blog item.

EPA Announces Clearance Of Backlog Of Chemical Risk Notifications: EPA announced on October 10, 2025, that it eliminated “an extensive backlog of notifications received from companies regarding chemical risks that needed review and routing across the agency.” EPA states that it assembled a team to eliminate the backlog of TSCA Section 8(e) submissions and address the challenges of adapting to modern demands. The team completed review and assessment of more than 3,000 TSCA Section 8(e) submissions. According to EPA, about 65 contacts across the Agency “now receive notifications of TSCA section 8(e) submissions on substances such as per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), pesticides, chemicals with pre-manufacture notices (PMNs) or significant new use rules (SNURs), high production volume chemicals (HPVs) and many more.” Of the approximately 3,000 backlogged TSCA Section 8(e) submissions processed by the team, the team flagged 920 as high interest and distributed them across the Agency.

To prevent future backlogs, EPA has taken the following steps:

Establishing a workgroup that leverages expertise of EPA staff across the Agency to identify inefficiencies in the Section 8(e) program and develop process improvements;

Enhancing the flagging process to categorize incoming TSCA Section 8(e) submissions for faster and more effective distribution to EPA staff, aiding in filling data gaps and meeting regulatory deadlines; and

Implementing a new automated notification system that sends weekly updates to EPA staff via e-mail when incoming Section 8(e) submissions may be relevant to their work.

LEGISLATIVE

House Bill Would Ban Diquat: On September 8, 2025, Representative Anna Paulina Luna (R-FL) introduced the Protect Our Farmers and Families Act of 2025 (H.R. 5196) to cancel the registration and prohibit all uses of diquat in the United States. Luna’s September 10, 2025, press release states that under the legislation:

All current uses of diquat will be deemed unsafe and canceled under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA);

EPA will revoke any existing food residue tolerances associated with diquat;

Sale, distribution, and use of existing stocks will be immediately prohibited; and

EPA will be barred from re-registering diquat for any future use.

Bipartisan, Bicameral Legislation Would Prohibit Manufacture And Use Of Asbestos: On September 16, 2025, Senator Jeff Merkley (D-OR) and Representatives Suzanne Bonamici (D-OR) and Don Bacon (R-NE) introduced bipartisan legislation (H.R. 5373, S. 2811) that would prohibit the manufacture, processing, use, and distribution in commerce of “all six recognized asbestos fibers,” according to Merkley’s September 16, 2025, press release. The bill would amend TSCA to prohibit the manufacture, processing, use, and distribution in commerce of commercial asbestos and mixtures and articles containing commercial asbestos. The bill defines commercial asbestos as the asbestiform varieties of the following, if extracted and processed for their commercial value: chrysotile (serpentine); crocidolite (riebeckite); amosite (cummingtonite-grunerite); anthophyllite; tremolite; actinolite; richterite; and winchite.

House Bill Would Amend FIFRA To Require More Coordination Between EPA And USDA: On September 26, 2025, Representative Jodey Arrington (R-TX), Chair of the House Budget Committee, introduced the USDA Communication Regarding Oversight of Pesticides (CROP) Act of 2025 (.R. 5564), which would require the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Office of Pest Management Policy (OPMP), “which frequently communicates with producers, to have a meaningful voice in the regulation of crop protection products.” Arrington’s September 30, 2025, press release states that:

Currently, OPMP provides feedback to EPA on the safe use of crop protection products, but EPA is not required to respond or consider OPMP’s guidance, giving EPA disproportionate input in regulation;

The CROP Act will create a more equitable balance of USDA and EPA input, ensuring that regulations reflect both producer and environmental considerations;

U.S. farmers and ranchers are coping with record inflation and broken supply chains. If these producers lose the ability to use certain crop protection products, farms will be forced to forgo conservation practices, like no-till farming, and revert to full tillage methods to control pests; and

It is vital that OPMP, which coordinates frequently with producers, has a role in this process to help EPA use the best science possible in conducting pesticide registrations and rulemakings to ensure users are not being subject to unnecessary, unscientific conditions.

Bipartisan Legislation Would Expand Access To PFAS Blood Testing For Seniors: On September 26, 2025, Representatives Debbie Dingell (D-MI) and Brian Fitzpatrick (R-PA), Co-Chairs of the bipartisan Congressional PFAS Task Force, introduced legislation (H.R. 5571) to enable Medicare beneficiaries to get blood tested for PFAS at no cost. According to Dingell’s September 26, 2025, press release, scientific studies have linked PFAS to a variety of health hazards, “including various cancers, increases in cholesterol levels, reproductive problems, as well as low birth weight and weakened childhood immunity.”

MISCELLANEOUS

ALJ Disapproves Minnesota’s Proposed PFAS Rule Package Pending Correction: As reported in our May 29, 2025, memorandum, on May 22, 2025, the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) held a public hearing on its proposed PFAS reporting rule. Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) Jim Mortenson considered the comments provided both during the hearing and in writing as he evaluated the proposed rule. His August 28, 2025, report on the proposed rule concludes that:

The proposed rule package must be disapproved for a procedural reason: MPCA failed to include an assessment of the cumulative effect of the proposed rules with federal TSCA regulations on PFAS reporting.

Based on a careful examination of the law, MPCA’s explanations, and public comments, the ALJ finds several provisions of the proposed rules that must be disapproved because they are either not rationally related to MPCA’s objective or the record does not demonstrate the need or reasonableness of the rule; exceeds, conflicts with, or does not comply with the enabling statute; and is not a rule or is otherwise not an enforceable law:

7026.0010, subp. 14 (definition of manufacturer);

7026.0040 (reporting updates);

7026.0050 (waivers);

7026.0090 (reporting exemptions); and

7026.0100 (fees).

The ALJ offers recommendations for correcting these deficiencies and suggestions for additional improvements to the proposed rules for the MPCA Commissioner to consider. More information is available in our September 26, 2025, blog item.

Comments Due October 8, 2025, On Connecticut’s Draft PFAS Reporting Form For Manufacturers And Draft Order Regarding Labeling: Beginning July 1, 2026, Connecticut will prohibit the manufacture, sale, and distribution of certain consumer products that contain intentionally added PFAS unless the manufacturer provides prior notification to the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection (DEEP) and labels these products. The consumer products are apparel; carpets or rugs; cleaning products; cookware; cosmetic products; dental floss; fabric treatments; children’s products; menstruation products; textile furnishings; ski wax; or upholstered furniture. The statute states that, beginning July 1, 2026, these products must be labeled. If one of these products is a component of another product, the product that contains the component must be labeled. All labels must be clearly visible prior to sale and inform the purchaser that PFAS is present in the product. Labels affixed to products must be constructed of materials that are sufficiently durable to remain legible for the useful life of the product.

The global wireless EV charging market is rapidly approaching a critical inflection point. It is transitioning from a niche concept into a transformative force within the automotive industry. This shift is happening as global EV sales continue their meteoric rise. For instance, over 17 million units of electric vehicles were sold across the world in 2024. In addition to this, over 4 million vehicles were sold in the first quarter of 2025, which is nearly 35% higher than the previous year. In fact, the Biden-Harris administration is aiming for 50% of new car sales to be electric by 2030. Consequently, the demand for more convenient and seamless charging solutions has become paramount.

The evolution of wireless electric vehicle charging is backed by significant government investment and concrete international standards. This progress is setting the stage for a future where plugging in becomes a thing of the past. This in-depth analysis explores the key segments, recent technological breakthroughs, and quantitative data that illustrate the explosive potential of charging electric cars wirelessly.

New Performance Benchmarks Validate Wireless Charging's Competitive Edge

The conversation around electric vehicle wireless charging is no longer just about convenience; it is now firmly about performance. Recent tests in the wireless EV charging market have demonstrated remarkable capabilities that rival traditional methods. For instance, researchers at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) developed a system that charges a Hyundai Kona Electric with 100 kW of power. This was achieved at a breakthrough 96% efficiency. The system successfully transferred this power across a 5-inch airgap, adding a 50% charge in just 20 minutes.

Moreover, an earlier benchtop test achieved an even higher 120 kW of power with 97% efficiency. This performance is 8 to 10 times the power density of previous technologies. Systems are now being developed across a range of power levels, with some wireless charging companies like Plugless Power offering 3.6 kW to 7.2 kW systems, while the 11 kW to 50 kW segment sees major development.

This project is an essential energy infrastructure initiative that would strengthen New York’s energy reliability, stimulate the economy, and advance environmental sustainability goals.

The delegation, comprised of Ranking Republican on the Senate Energy Committee Mario R. Mattera (2nd Senate District), Senator Anthony Palumbo (1st Senate District), Senator Dean Murray (3rd Senate District), Senator Steven Rhoads (5th Senate District), Senator Jack Martins (7th Senate District), Senator Alexis Weik (8th Senate District), and Senator Patricia Canzoneri-Fitzpatrick (9th Senate District), emphasized in their letter that NESE represents a strategic investment in the state’s energy future, with measurable economic and environmental benefits.

The NESE project is projected to increase New York’s natural gas capacity by approximately 13%, addressing the growing demand from residents, small businesses, and emerging industries such as artificial intelligence–driven data centers. This increase in capacity would help ensure system resilience amid extreme weather events and potential supply disruptions.

Economically, NESE represents a $1 billion direct investment, expected to generate $548 million in economic activity, produce nearly $37 million in state and local tax revenue, and support approximately 2,000 direct and indirect jobs—including 1,200 construction jobs. The project is also anticipated to deliver $230 million in wages and benefits to New York’s workforce.

“The NESE project is about more than energy—it’s about jobs, reliability, and keeping Long Island’s economy strong,” said Senator Mattera. “This project will create thousands of good-paying union jobs for our hardworking men and women of labor, help protect consumers from rising energy costs, and ensure our communities have the stable, affordable energy they need for years to come. Governor Hochul should move this project forward without delay.”

""The Northeast Supply Enhancement Project is a smart, forward-thinking investment in New York's future. It not only creates thousands of good-paying union jobs, but also provides environmental benefits, and strengthens our energy infrastructure. I urge Governor Hochul to support this critical, common-sense project that will help keep New York's energy system reliable and strong,"" stated Senator Murray.

“This project is about ensuring Long Island and New York have the reliable energy infrastructure we need to power our homes and businesses. The NESE project is a smart investment in our future that strengthens our economy and supports good-paying jobs,” added Senator Canzoneri-Fitzpatrick.

“The Northeast Supply Enhancement Project is a common sense investment in our energy infrastructrue that will increase the supply of clean, efficient natural gas for our homes, our communities and our economy. The governor needs to support this vital project,” said Senator Weik.

""The NESE project is a direct investment in our working families and local workforce,” added Senator Steven Rhoads. “Long Islanders expect and deserve safe, affordable and dependable energy options, especially as the cost of living continues rise. This project offers real relief — delivering long-term savings, diversifying our energy portfolio, and creating thousands of good-paying union jobs. A recent bipartisan poll shows that 72% of New Yorkers support new natural gas pipelines like NESE, 84% see natural gas as a reliable energy source, and 76% consider it affordable. It’s time to make energy decisions based upon affordability and common sense. Governor Hochul should listen to her constituents and make NESE a priority for New York’s future.”

Independent analysis cited in the letter indicates NESE could save New Yorkers up to $6 billion in electricity costs over the next 15 years, with nearly half of those savings benefitting downstate residents.

Additionally, by reducing reliance on diesel-fueled truck deliveries of liquefied natural gas (LNG), the project is expected to cut greenhouse gas emissions and decrease oil dependence—advancing New York’s broader environmental objectives.

The delegation’s letter concludes with a call for the Governor’s timely action, emphasizing that New Yorkers deserve an energy system that is reliable, affordable, and environmentally responsible.",https://www.nysenate.gov/sites/default/files/2025/10/15/nese-map-875x548.jpg,N,,2025-10-16 01:59:46.182582

First the good news. Rebecca Elliott, energy reporter for the New York Times, wrote recently that the US will continue to see a surge in renewable energy for the next two years. How is that possible, when the administration is cancelling wind and solar projects at a furious pace? The answer is, there are a lot of them already in the pipeline and developers are rushing to get them started sooner than planned to make sure they qualify for federal tax incentives before they disappear on July 1, 2026 — several years earlier than expected.

The new rules say, in order to qualify, projects must be “started” before that date, although exactly what “started” means is not entirely clear and it will be up to the IRS to make the final determination. That, of course, means the administration can impose its will on the IRS and if the agency doesn’t play along, its leaders will be fired and replaced with people who will bend their knees to the pudgy potentate in the White House.

To hit that deadline, many developers have ordered the power transformers that control the voltage output of solar panels and other equipment much sooner than they normally would. Getting those orders placed will demonstrate that a project is “started,” they hope.

Only relatively big companies can afford to spend such huge sums upfront, and analysts expect them to start buying smaller projects whose backers are strapped for cash, Elliott reported. For example, CleanCapital has purchased about $25 million worth of solar panels even though it doesn’t need them yet and is storing them in a rented warehouse in California at a cost of $145,000 a month.

“This rush is real,” Jennifer Granholm, who was Joe Biden’s energy secretary, told the press recently. “You’ll see an uptick in the next two years, and then you’ll see a diminishment after that, unless something changes.”

What could possibly change? America is in love with its very own fascist dictator. The only change that would matter is if control of Congress were to switch after the mid-term elections a year from now and the Democrats obtained a veto-proof majority. The odds of that happening are about the same as Kate Smith rising from the dead to give us one more chorus of “God Bless America.”

Renewable Energy Momentum

Elliott wrote that the tidal wave of clean energy development “reflects just how much momentum the sector has, not just because of subsidies, but because there is tremendous demand for new sources of energy. Solar and batteries can be installed much faster than natural gas and nuclear power plants. Solar and batteries have also become cheaper, while the cost of building gas power plants has soared.”

This year, renewable energy and batteries will make up around 93% of the capacity added to US grids, according to the federal Energy Information Administration. “We have never seen this kind of demand, ever,” said Sandhya Ganapathy, chief executive of EDP Renewables North America, which is why its development plans have not changed significantly ever after Congress rolled back the tax credits. Nevertheless, some smaller solar companies are laying off staff or preparing to shut down.

Federal tax credits for grid-scale battery storage were not affected by the cuts in the One Big Beautiful Bill, so more developers are switching to building batteries, which are in high demand to help balance the wind and solar projects completed in recent years. Still and all, the US has made it a national policy to spike renewable energy, which can be built cheaply and quickly, and favor thermal generation that relies on heat from burning coal or methane or splitting atoms, which is much more expensive and can take a decade or more to build.

Krugman On Renewables

Now the bad news. Nobel Laureate Paul Krugman wrote on Substack this week, “China Has Overtaken America.” He suggested that electrical generation is a good indirect way to measure economic development and noted that China today generates twice as much electricity as does the US. He compared that to a second “Sputnik moment” for America. Yet unlike the Soviet Union, which was a shell of a nation propped up by bluster and bombast, China is a much more potent opponent.

“Rather than acknowledging that the US is in danger of being permanently overtaken by China’s technological and economic prowess, the Trump administration is slashing support for scientific research and attacking education. In the name of defeating the bogeymen of “wokeness” and the “deep state”, this administration is actively opposing progress in critical sectors while giving grifters like the crypto industry everything that they want.

“The most obvious example of Trump’s war on a critical sector, and the most consequential for the next decade, is his vendetta against renewable energy. Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill rolled back Biden’s tax incentives for renewable energy. The administration is currently trying to kill a huge, nearly completed offshore wind farm that could power hundreds of thousands of homes, as well as cancel $7 billion in grants for residential solar panels. It appears to have succeeded in killing a huge solar energy project that would have powered almost 2 million homes. It has canceled $8 billion in clean energy grants, mostly in Democratic states, and is reportedly planning to cancel tens of billions more.

“While Trump proclaims “Drill, Baby, Drill”, projected growth in U.S. solar and wind power has been stunted, and perhaps even stalled, by the administration’s hostility.”

Krugman speculated on the source of that hostility and anti-intellectualism and concluded that it is actually deeply ingrained in the American psyche:

“Anti-scientism is a widespread attitude on the religious right, which forms a key component of MAGA. In past decades, however, the forces of humanism and scientific inquiry were able to prevail against anti-scientism. In part this was due to the recognition that American science was essential for national security as well as national prosperity.

“But now we have an administration that claims to be protecting national security by imposing tariffs on kitchen cabinets and bathroom vanities, while gutting the CDC and the EPA.

“Does this mean that the US is losing the race with China for global leadership? No, I think that race is essentially over. Even if Trump and his team of saboteurs lose power in 2028, everything I see says that by then America will have fallen so far behind that it’s unlikely that we will ever catch up.”

That is what should worry people of conscience the most. Ignorance is not a family value. Nor is it a basis upon which to build a nation that leads the world in anything but the number of mass murders that take place each year. If we do not awaken from this national nightmare — and soon — the America we knew and loved will be nothing more than a distant memory.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/EDFRenewables_MtSterlingFoxSquirrelSolarProject_Photo_by_Matt_Reese-scaled-e1716402001567.jpg,N,,2025-10-16 06:59:20.023893

In Việt Nam, six national greenhouse gas inventories have been conducted, showing the government's determination to transparently report emission data and fulfill international obligations.
Agriculture accounts for a large proportion of the total national emissions, primarily from paddy cultivation, livestock farming, and fertilizer use.
In livestock farming, Nghệ An, together with TH Group, has pioneered the trend of green production, applying high technology and reducing emissions.
“This is a testament to the vision of ""green agriculture – circular economy – sustainable development,"" while also paving the way for other businesses,” said Hùng.","NGHỆ AN Measuring greenhouse gas emissions and participating in the carbon credit market are opening new opportunities, helping Vietnamese agricultural products enhance their value, affirm their position, and increase global competitiveness.

This was the key theme of the training programme ""Enhancing Media Capacity for Carbon Neutrality"" organised by the Ministry of Agriculture and Environment on October 15.

According to Assoc. Prof., Dr. Mai Văn Trịnh, Director of the Institute of Agricultural Environment, climate change is affecting all sectors, with agriculture being both impacted and a major source of emissions.

“Measuring and managing greenhouse gas emissions is an essential requirement for moving towards a green, sustainable agriculture,” said Dr. Trịnh.

In Việt Nam, six national greenhouse gas inventories have been conducted, showing the government's determination to transparently report emission data and fulfill international obligations. Agriculture accounts for a large proportion of the total national emissions, primarily from paddy cultivation, livestock farming, and fertilizer use.

Greenhouse gas emissions not only affect the environment but also directly impact the productivity, quality, and reputation of Vietnamese agricultural products in the international market. The EU, Japan, and the United States have all established carbon standards as technical barriers.

""If we do not proactively control [emissions], Vietnamese agriculture will lose opportunities in the global supply chain,"" he said.

Measurement, Reporting, and Verification (MRV) of emissions is the ""backbone"" of modern carbon governance.

2025 marks a significant turning point as the Government approved the Scheme to establish a domestic carbon market under Decision 232/QD-TTg. The pilot phase from 2025-2028 aims for the official operation of the carbon exchange from 2029, allowing organisations and enterprises to trade and buy/sell ""carbon credits"" – equivalent to 1 ton of reduced CO₂ emissions.

Additionally, Decree 119/2025/ND-CP has just been issued, supplementing and perfecting the legal framework for the carbon market. It clearly stipulates the responsibilities of ministries, sectors, localities, and enterprises in inventorying and reporting emissions, while also encouraging voluntary and innovative models in emission reduction and carbon absorption.

""If MRV and carbon market participation are handled well, Vietnamese agriculture will not only contribute to achieving the Net Zero 2050 commitment but also open up new revenue streams from carbon credits, providing farmers and businesses with additional motivation to invest in green production,"" said Dr. Trịnh.

As carbon becomes a measurable and tradable ""asset,"" Vietnamese agriculture needs to transform quickly. Investing in emission measurement technology, circular economy models, and international standard MRV will be key for Việt Nam to affirm its position in the global green economy.

According to Deputy Director of the ministry’s Department of Climate Change Nguyễn Tuấn Quang Việt Nam has finalised many important policies to achieve carbon neutrality. The Prime Minister’s Decision No 896/QD-TTg of 2022 approved the National Strategy on Climate Change to 2050, setting a net-zero emissions target by 2050.

On that basis, ministries, sectors, and localities have specified these commitments through action plans, technical guidelines, and management mechanisms. The Ministry of Industry and Trade and the Ministry of Construction have issued circulars on technical standards and energy management, while the Ministry of Agriculture and Environment coordinates in developing national reports and action plans to implement the Net Zero commitment.

From a local perspective, Deputy Director of Nghệ An Province's Department of Agriculture and Environment Nguyễn Danh Hùng, stated that the locality has proactively applied sustainable development solutions, adapted to climate change, and reduced methane emissions in agriculture. Specifically, Nghệ An is focusing on promoting low-emission agricultural and forestry production models, contributing towards the carbon neutrality goal.

The forestry sector is significantly benefiting as Nghệ An is among the localities with the largest forest area nationwide, boasting over 1.036 million hectares, including 790,000ha of natural forest.

The province has been selected to participate in the North Central Region's Emission Reduction Payment Agreement (ERPA) programme for the 2023–2025 period, with over 38,400 forest owners receiving payments from carbon credits. This model is likened to ""a rain shower in the dry season,"" helping locals improve their livelihoods while raising awareness about forest protection.

In livestock farming, Nghệ An, together with TH Group, has pioneered the trend of green production, applying high technology and reducing emissions. Two key enterprises of TH Group have been certified as carbon neutral by Control Union (Netherlands) according to international standard PAS 2060:2014.

“This is a testament to the vision of ""green agriculture – circular economy – sustainable development,"" while also paving the way for other businesses,” said Hùng.

Additionally, the province is collaborating with pioneering enterprises such as Green Carbon and Faeger to implement a low-emission rice production project, applying the ""alternate wetting and drying"" technique on over 19,000ha, creating a premise for low-carbon agricultural production. VNS

S. 688 contains no intergovernmental mandates as defined in UMRA.","Bill Summary

S. 688 would reauthorize the National Sea Grant College Program until September 30, 2031. In addition, the bill would authorize appropriations for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and other federal agencies to expand enforcement of regulations against illegal, unreported, or unregulated (IUU) fishing and establish and maintain a blacklist of foreign vessels involved in those activities. The bill would increase sanctions and penalties for violators and would require agencies to track the use of forced labor on those vessels.

Estimated Federal Cost

The estimated budgetary effect of S. 688 is shown in Table 1. The costs of the legislation fall within budget function 300 (natural resources and environment).

Basis of Estimate

CBO assumes that S. 688 will be enacted by the end of calendar year 2025 and that the authorized and necessary amounts will be available in each year.

Spending Subject to Appropriation

Based on historical spending patterns, CBO estimates that implementing the bill would cost $587 million over the 2026-2030 period.

National Sea Grant College Program. S. 688 would authorize the appropriation of $112 million annually from 2026 through 2031 for the National Sea Grant College Program. That program is a partnership between NOAA and 34 universities that focuses on research, conservation, and the effective use of U.S. coastal resources. In 2024, the Congress provided $80 million for the program. CBO estimates that implementing the provision would cost $489 million over the 2026-2030 period and $175 million after 2030, assuming appropriation of the authorized amounts.

Enforcement of Illegal-Fishing Regulations and Blacklisting Violators. S. 688 would authorize the appropriation of $20 million annually from 2026 through 2030 for NOAA, in coordination with Customs and Border Protection, and the Departments of Labor and State, to expand enforcement of regulations against IUU fishing.

Under the bill, NOAA would maintain and publish a blacklist of foreign vessels that violate IUU‑fishing regulations and that are identified as using forced labor in those activities. The agency also would be directed to issue regulations for adding vessels to and removing them from the list.

S. 688 also would authorize $4 million for the National Academy of Sciences to study the use of forced labor in IUU fishing, the costs to the global economy of those activities, and the effectiveness of strategies for deterring them.

CBO estimates that implementing those provisions would cost $91 million over the 2026‑2030 period and $12 million after 2030, assuming appropriation of the authorized amounts.

Administrative Costs. Using information from the agencies, CBO estimates that implementing S. 688 would cost NOAA $4 million in the first year to develop a strategy to increase IUU-fishing inspection and enforcement programs, to coordinate with other federal agencies and regional fisheries management organizations, and to collect and analyze data and prepare reports. Thereafter, costs would total about $1 million annually for enforcement and increased screening of seafood imports. CBO estimates that those activities would cost a total of $7 million over the 2026‑2030 period; any related spending would be subject to the availability of appropriated funds.

Direct Spending and Revenues

S. 688 would allow the Administration to impose sanctions on any foreign persons or entities engaging in IUU fishing. CBO estimates that enacting the bill would have an insignificant effect on direct spending and revenues over the 2026-2035 period stemming from the sanctions the bill would authorize.

Under current law, the Administration can sanction foreign persons and entities that engage in corruption, including IUU fishing. If the enactment of S. 688 leads the Administration to broaden those sanctions, more people would be denied visas by the Department of State, resulting in an insignificant decrease in revenues from visa fees. Although most visa fees are retained by the Department of State and spent, some collections are deposited in the Treasury as revenues. Denying foreign nationals entry into the United States also would reduce direct spending on federal benefits (emergency Medicaid or federal subsidies for health insurance, for example) for which those people might otherwise be eligible.

The bill would block transactions involving certain assets either in the United States or under the control of people or entities in the United States. Under the bill, any person or entity violating those prohibitions would be subject to civil or criminal monetary penalties. Such penalties are recorded as revenues, and a portion can be spent without further appropriation.

Using data from similar sanctions, CBO estimates that any additional sanctions imposed under the bill would affect a small number of people. Thus, enacting S. 688 would have insignificant effects on revenues and direct spending, and would, on net, reduce deficits by insignificant amounts over the 2026-2035 period.

Pay-As-You-Go Considerations

The Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010 establishes budget-reporting and enforcement procedures for legislation affecting direct spending or revenues. CBO estimates that enacting the bill would change direct spending and revenues by less than $500,000 over the 2026‑2035 period.

Increase in Long-Term Net Direct Spending and Deficits

CBO estimates that enacting S. 688 would not increase net direct spending or on-budget deficits in any of the four consecutive 10-year periods beginning in 2036.

Mandates

S. 688 would impose a private-sector mandate as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA) by expanding the scope of authority for the Administration to regulate transactions between entities in the United States and foreign entities and officials of foreign governments who would be subject to sanctions under the bill. That expansion would result in additional burdens on individuals and entities, such as banks, in the United States that are required to monitor and report on foreign transactions and to block access to certain assets owned by sanctioned entities. Such an expansion also would prohibit transactions between entities in the United States and sanctioned parties that otherwise would be permitted under current law.

The cost of the mandate would be any income or profit lost as a result of the bill’s enactment. CBO expects that because a small number of people or entities would be affected, the loss of income from any incremental increase in restrictions imposed by the bill would be small as well. CBO estimates that the cost of the mandate would fall well below the annual threshold established in UMRA for private-sector mandates ($206 million in 2025, adjusted annually for inflation).

S. 688 contains no intergovernmental mandates as defined in UMRA.

Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is a critical part of maintaining and growing the manufacturing industry in our state.","BATON ROUGE, La. (Louisiana First) — Gov. Jeff Landry declared a moratorium on new carbon capture injection wells applications in Louisiana on Wednesday.

The Louisiana Department of Conservation and Energy is ordered to reevaluate the status of Class VI permit applications over the next 45 days. Landry explained that the order is to give residents and local officials a “clear roadmap” to ensure that applications for proposed projects follow state rules for carbon injection and carbon dioxide pipelines.

Landry said it is necessary that the department can take a methodical approach to application review and permitting, with safety for people and the environment in mind.

Industry groups release statements

Statement from the Louisiana Association of Business and Industry.

“Louisiana’s energy sector is the envy of the nation and the world. The expertise and talent of our workforce, combined with the state’s abundant natural resources, make the state a global destination for energy investment and innovation. LABI’s commitment to ensuring that Louisiana remains a top destination for investment, technological advancement and job creation is ironclad.

“While this appears to be a shared goal of the Landry administration, today’s executive

order on carbon capture and sequestration sends the wrong message. The order risks

ceding Louisiana’s competitive advantage to neighboring states eager to move forward with CCS investments.

“Carbon capture and sequestration is a key piece to growing and retaining the high-wage energy, industrial and manufacturing jobs that sustain Louisiana families, while also ensuring the long-term viability of our state’s oil, gas and petrochemical industries.

“Louisiana has already secured billions of dollars in CCS-related investments from

companies committed to delivering products and energy safely and efficiently with a lower carbon footprint. These projects generate millions in local tax revenue, supporting infrastructure improvements, school upgrades and economic development in communities.

“The momentum Louisiana has built is no accident. It is the direct result of securing state primacy and leveraging our unique geology, world-class energy infrastructure and highly skilled workforce. Together, these advantages have positioned Louisiana as a global leader in the energy marketplace. By injecting uncertainty and regulatory hurdles into this process, we stand to undo all the progress that state leaders have touted for months.

“We cannot yield our position to states like Texas that stand ready to capture these same opportunities. CCS represents a chance to strengthen Louisiana’s energy sector and make us the energy giant of the future we know we can be.

“LABI stands ready to work with the Landry administration and President Trump to ensure Louisiana secures our energy future, creating good-paying jobs and thriving local communities for generations to come. This shared vision can only be realized by building on our existing resources and embracing innovative technologies like carbon capture and sequestration, sending a clear message: Louisiana is open for business.”

Statement from the Louisiana Chemical Association.

“The Louisiana Chemical Association appreciates Governor Landry’s focus on public safety, environmental stewardship, and economic growth. We share his commitment to responsible industrial development and community engagement, and we value the Administration’s broader efforts to establish Louisiana as a premier place for business investments. To that end, our industry has already committed over $60 billion to projects that depend on carbon capture and storage.

“That is why we are concerned that a conditional moratorium on new Class VI permit applications, as announced today, sends the wrong message to the market at a pivotal moment for Louisiana’s economy. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is a critical part of maintaining and growing the manufacturing industry in our state. A pause on applications, regardless of the reasoning, signals uncertainty for projects that enable lower-emissions production, support thousands of high-wage jobs, and encourage future reinvestment.

“Louisiana earned federal approval to run its own Class VI program so that permitting could be rigorous, predictable, and efficient here at home. That hard-won primacy, and the state’s recent issuance of its first Class VI permit, demonstrate that Louisiana can safely develop these projects in a way that protects communities and natural resources while continuing to encourage industrial investment in the state. A moratorium undermines that predictability at the very time companies are making multi-billion-dollar, multi-decade siting decisions.

“LCA remains committed to working with the Governor, state agencies, and local officials to address concerns and deliver the environmental and economic benefits made possible by CCS projects in the state. Louisiana should proudly lead the nation in safe, responsible industrial decarbonization rather than signaling hesitation that allows other states to seize this opportunity.”

Statement from the Louisiana Oil and Gas Association.

“We respectfully disagree with the Governor‘s decision to halt the review of any new CCUS applications.

“We are thankful that the Governor didn’t cancel existing CCUS projects, which will continue to prove how safe this technology actually is, and we encourage industry to continue moving forward with the hope that the Governor will lift this moratorium sooner rather than later.

“For 75+ years Louisiana’s regulatory arm has safely authorized and governed injection wells. AND for 40+ years through Enhanced Oil Recovery, the Department has safely regulated the injection of CO2. In fact, since 2010, over 47 billion metric tons of CO2 have been safely injected and ultimately stored in Louisiana formations.

“Carbon capture is a proven tool that will bring significant economic development and new opportunities to our state and our country, and we remain committed to advancing these benefits for Louisiana.”

Statement from American Petroleum Institute Gulf Coast Region Director Gifford Briggs.

“We share the governor’s goal of addressing the backlog of CCS project applications, but an indefinite moratorium undermines Louisiana’s energy leadership and sets a precedent that could discourage development and innovation across the Gulf Coast and the nation. This executive order creates uncertainty that could delay projects, and send jobs and opportunities elsewhere. Now, Louisiana’s leadership role in American energy security is in jeopardy.”

The decision has left the 3,000 workers at the Brampton plant in limbo as they wait to hear future plans.
“Americans don’t want to buy cars that are made in Canada,” Trump said.
Unifor national president Lana Payne said the federal government needs to do all it can to defend the Brampton plant, the auto sector and other industries feeling the weight of tariffs.
“If the U.S. turns Canada into its enemy, the automotive industry of Canada will look elsewhere for partners.”","The federal government threatened legal action after carmaker Stellantis said it will move planned vehicle production from its plant in Brampton, Ont., to Illinois, sparking fears about the future of Canada’s auto industry as U.S. President Donald Trump tries to undo 60 years of integration.

Industry Minister Melanie Joly expressed her “extreme concern” about the move in a letter Wednesday to the company where she threatened legal action.

“The business decision to move the mandate of the Jeep Compass is unacceptable,” she said in the letter, a copy of which was obtained by CityNews.

She said the company had agreed to maintain its full Canadian footprint, including Brampton operations, in exchange for substantial financial support over decades. It refers to the 2009 government bailouts of the auto sector during the financial crisis when Stellantis was on “the brink of bankruptcy.”

“Anything short of fulfilling that commitment will be considered as default.”

Stellantis said in a statement that it has plans for the Brampton plant, but didn’t provide any details on what those might be.

The company also said it continues to invest in Canada, including adding a third shift to the Windsor Assembly Plant where it produces the Chrysler Pacifica minivan and Dodge Charger.

“Canada is very important to us,” said Stellantis spokeswoman LouAnn Gosselin in a statement.

Ontario Premier Doug Ford said the company has told him they’re going to keep the plant, but that reopening will be delayed as they figure out which vehicle they’ll produce there.

He said he’s told the company how disappointed he is in the decision, and that the company won’t be getting any more funding until it fulfils its obligations.

“I’m not going to give them a penny,” Ford said Wednesday.

Stellantis announced the decision as part of a US$13-billion spending commitment in the U.S. that will see it boost production in the country by 50 per cent over the next four years.

The decision has left the 3,000 workers at the Brampton plant in limbo as they wait to hear future plans.

Joly said the company will have to extend supports for those workers until at least 2027 in light of the latest decision.

Opposition Leader Pierre Poilievre said the government was failing to protect autoworkers.

“After promising to ‘negotiate a win’ with President Trump and giving billions in handouts to the company, the elbows-down Prime Minister got no job guarantees for autoworkers,” he said in a statement.

Prime Minister Mark Carney met with Trump in Washington last week, where the president showed no signs of relenting on tariffs. He said the U.S. wants to make its own steel and autos and warned that Canada and the U.S. have “natural” business conflicts.

“Americans don’t want to buy cars that are made in Canada,” Trump said. “It’s a tough situation because we want to make our cars here. At the same time, we want Canada to do well making cars. So, we’re working on formulas and I think we’ll get there.”

Joly said on Wednesday the federal government will work to hold Stellantis to account.

“We will fight for these jobs,” she told reporters following a fireside chat in Fredericton.

“I’ll continue to work night and day on this issue.”

The loss of a committed vehicle makes the outlook for Brampton more dire, and the need to find new partners beyond U.S. automakers more pressing, said Greig Mordue, associate professor at McMaster University’s W Booth School of Engineering.

“Any reasonable person looking at the status of Brampton could probably look at it and say, that’s in tough shape, and frankly, yesterday’s announcement made it even tougher.”

Production at the plant ended in late December 2023 and retooling began in January 2024 to prepare for the Jeep Compass. After Trump started rolling out tariffs earlier this year, the company halted work on retooling in February.

The latest decision by Stellantis follows on several moves by Detroit automakers to delay or cut back production in Canada, as tariffs come in and electric vehicle adoption has been slower than expected.

General Motors idled its CAMI assembly plant that produces EV delivery trucks in Ingersoll, Ont., for months this year and is moving to a single shift there. The company is also set to cut a shift at its Oshawa plant in January. Meanwhile, Ford last year shifted plans for its Oakville assembly plant that will see production delayed.

“The reality is those U.S. automakers have almost abandoned Canada. I mean, they’ve got a plant in Windsor, and a declining plant in Oshawa making vehicles. That’s it,” said Mordue.

Given the current situation, he said it’s time Canada look to potentially try and attract rising auto producers, especially from China, if it wants to maintain the sector long-term.

Unifor national president Lana Payne said the federal government needs to do all it can to defend the Brampton plant, the auto sector and other industries feeling the weight of tariffs.

“Targeted Canadian industries are already experiencing the financial impact and job losses due to Trump’s sustained attacks,” she said in a statement.

“Stellantis cannot be allowed to renege on its commitments to Canadian workers, and governments cannot stand by while our jobs are shifted to the United States.”

Flavio Volpe, head of the Automotive Parts Manufacturers’ Association, said parts suppliers that have invested hundreds of millions of dollars to supply the Brampton plant only found out about the decision through the news.

He said the cowardly decision also puts in doubt the jobs of some 10,000 workers at parts suppliers are also relying on Brampton getting a product.

“It’s not OK,” said Volpe.

“Canadians have been committed to investing in the auto sector because they trust these companies to follow through.”

He said he doesn’t put much stock in the company’s vague commitments for Brampton.

“I’ve been around long enough to know a plan and a car are two different things.”

While the company says it remains committed to Canada, the decision dilutes the potential of the Brampton plant going forward, said Sam Fiorani, vice-president of global vehicle forecasting at AutoForecast Solutions.

“A move like this falls right into the hands of the Trump administration’s desire to move product to the U.S.”

He said that given the company’s announcement to build so many other vehicles in the U.S., it looks like the Windsor plant is still at least needed.

The wider concern is the fragmenting of the North American auto industry will weaken the sectors in all three countries, said Fiorani.

“Canada, U.S., and Mexico made a great team on the global market, and none of those countries is large enough or strong enough to compete with the likes of China and the EU.”

He said that if the U.S. keeps moving forward with shutting out Canada’s auto sector, then it might make sense to look to partner with Chinese manufacturers that have been looking at Canada for over a decade.

“If the U.S. turns Canada into its enemy, the automotive industry of Canada will look elsewhere for partners.”",https://kitchener.citynews.ca/wp-content/blogs.dir/sites/3/2025/10/4a5ba89b6b7021d5a8d8b855034ef9276e116a2d94ec21e2bc32b2bd2b5a6445.jpg,N,,2025-10-15 23:04:01.897626

The new guidance from the state Department of Conservation and Energy is part of a concerted effort to prioritize carbon capture projects and implement a new law requiring more local input in the regulatory process.

The six priority projects are:

Capio Sherburne CCS Well No. 1 in Pointe Coupee Parish.

CCS 2 - Wilcox by CapturePoint in Vernon Parish.

Goose Lake by Gulf Coast Sequestration in Calcasieu Parish.

Minerva by Gulf Coast Sequestration in Cameron Parish.

Louisiana Green Fuels Columbia in Caldwell Parish.

River Parish Sequestration - RPN 1 in Ascension Parish.

On Sept. 1, Tyler Gray, Gov. Jeff Landry's outgoing energy secretary, directed staff to focus on those projects to efficiently allocate department resources.

Agency officials say it takes about 2,000 man-hours to review an application but are trying to have them reviewed within two years of submission.

Dustin Davidson, who took over as energy secretary after Gray, is following through on the directive, according to a department spokesman. Davidson was deputy secretary under Gray.

In an interview Wednesday, Davidson said the six projects selected had the best economics and the least amount of ""leak paths.""

One of the key points of review on carbon capture and sequestration projects is how well underground formations can hold carbon dioxide and how many faults, old wells and other underground penetrations exist that could provide a route for stored CO2 to escape.

""That is what allows us to determine that those are good projects to move forward with and prioritize,"" Davidson said. ""We will continue to do that process moving forward in terms of identifying, again, the safest in terms of the amount of leak paths and the best economic value to the state and to the local communities.""

All of the six, except for the two by Gulf Coast Sequestration, have been in technical review by the department since the spring of 2024. The review stage is the last but also one of the lengthiest steps before projects go to public hearings and receive final consideration.

Though industry groups have criticized a new executive order that laid out the administration's plans for reviewing carbon capture and sequestration projects, one of the companies on the department's short list welcomed the news.

CapturePoint Solutions' CENLA Hub in Vernon Parish is on the short list. Officials said they appreciated Landry's establishment of a clear, responsible framework for carbon management and storage in Louisiana.

""This is a major step forward for the CENLA Hub and for Louisiana’s carbon management future,"" said Greg Harper, CapturePoint president and CEO. ""We’re pleased that Louisiana recognizes the CENLA Hub as an industry leader – designed for safety, environmental protection, economic development and genuine community partnership.”

The $5 billion hub would support more than 55 permanent high-paying jobs and more than 500 construction jobs, the company says.

Projects that rely on the storage site could generate up to $17 billion in new industrial facilities and carbon capture equipment, creating more than 800 additional full-time jobs.

Those combined investments would support regional industries like paper, pulp, manufacturing and energy, the company says.

But the state's top short list leaves off other applications by the same companies in different or even the same parishes.

Other projects that have generated considerable controversy were also left off the list, including Air Products' proposed injection field in Lake Maurepas. Projects proposed in Allen Parish by ExxonMobil's and Occidental's carbon capture subsidiaries did not make the list; neither did a project by Occidental in Livingston Parish.

Davidson said some projects have generated significant public concern because work started happening before local officials even knew what was happening.

Will sales now crater sans credits? That remains to be seen, but for now, California’s EV market share has surged to a European-style level, and the state continues to take measures to keep the EV transition going.

In the third quarter of 2025, “zero-emission vehicles” (as defined by the California Energy Commission) accounted for 29.1% of new car sales, the highest quarterly sales share ever recorded in the state.

Now, the CEC’s definition of ZEVs is a little different than the one the rest of us use—it includes both battery EVs and plug-in hybrids. If we de-hype their figures, we find that battery EVs achieved a 25% market share in the 3rd quarter (and 21% year-to-date). That’s still a record, and still impressive. We also find that EVs are soundly outselling PHEVs (277,444 vs 48,085 YTD). (Yes, fuel cell vehicles are still around, but only in trace amounts—239 have been sold YTD.)

“This is unprecedented – we’re nearing a third of all new vehicles sold in the fourth largest economy on the planet being clean cars,” said Governor Gavin Newsom. “We’re setting new records because this state believes in innovation, not isolation. While [the federal government] sells out American innovation to China, California will keep charging ahead on our path to a future of cleaner air.”

“This is a defining moment for California’s ZEV progress and sends a clear message to Washington: ZEVs are here to stay,” said California Energy Commissioner Nancy Skinner.

Other stats back up Ms. Skinner’s assertion: In Q1 of this year, there were 146 ZEV models available in the state, compared to 105 models in Q1 of last year. The CEC says there are over 200,000 publicly accessible EV charging stations statewide, and an estimated 800,000 private EV chargers at single-family homes.

California continues to work to improve the state’s EV charging network. In October, the state adopted new EV charger reliability and reporting regulations, and the CEC approved two National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) Formula Program projects that will build out 64 fast chargers along key highway corridors. CEC also approved three grants totaling more than $10 million, to build out more than 1,000 Level 2 EV charging ports, the majority in low-income, disadvantaged, or affordable multifamily housing complexes.",https://chargedevs.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Rivian-Tesla-Supercharger-Charged-EVs-stock.jpg,N,,2025-10-15 21:03:51.506948

This comes after last month's announcement that clean truck sales rose in California in 2024, with manufacturers reporting nearly 1 in 4 trucks, buses, and vans sold were zero-emission.

Californians have purchased 2,468,158 new ZEVs, surpassing the state's goal of 1.5 million ZEVs on California roads by 2025.

""While Trump sells out American innovation to China, California will keep charging ahead on our path to a future of cleaner air.”

Federal tax credits cut in 'Big Beautiful Bill'

The recent surge in ZEV purchases is attributed to the Sept. 30 expiration of the federal tax credit, which offered up to $7,500 for new EVs and $4,000 for used models.

Originally set to expire in 2032 as part of the Inflation Reduction Act, the Biden-era incentives were eliminated in HR 1 - ""The Big Beautiful Bill,"" signed by President Trump in July.

The lapsed federal tax credits meant significant savings to consumers, as reported by EnergySage. A $7,500 credit represented a 13% discount towards the $57,245 average cost of a new electric vehicle in August, according to Kelly Blue Book.

""Despite the efforts by the Trump administration to derail the ZEV industry and raise the cost of a clean car, Californians made it clear they want to drive ZEVs as they scooped up the remaining federal tax credits that expired at the end of last month,"" the California governor's statement continued.

Are there any EV tax credits still available?

While no federal tax credits exist and the popular California Clean Vehicle Rebate Project expired in 2023, grants and rebates are available for low-income Californians to purchase ZEVs, with information available at ClimateAction.ca.gov or ElectricForAll.org.

Californians may also find EV purchase incentives depending on where they live.

Generally offered by utility providers, the rebates vary in amount and scope. For example, Los Angeles Department of Water and Power customers can get rebates up to $4,000 on used electric or plug-in hybrid vehicles.

The San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District's Drive Clean in the San Joaquin Rebate Program provides rebates up to $3,000 to Valley residents and businesses to purchase or lease new, clean-air vehicles.

Rebates are not always guaranteed, can change, or programs can run out of funds, so a good rule of thumb is to regularly check your local utility or district for the most up-to-date information.

Where to find reliable EV chargers

If you are about to buy an EV or are one of the millions of Californians who already own one, finding a reliable charging station will be at your mind.

In California, there are now over 200,000 publicly accessible EV charging stations, announced the state last month.

Their state is also about to get a whole lot more.

The California Energy Commission also recently approved two National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) Formula Program projects to build 64 fast EV chargers along key highway corridors.

The commission also approved three grants totaling more than $10 million that will build out more than 1,000 Level 2 EV charging ports, the vast majority in low-income, disadvantaged, or affordable multifamily housing complexes throughout the state.

“If federal clean energy and clean vehicle incentives are rolled back, the job growth and resurgence of clean energy manufacturing could be at risk,” the report states.
Percentage-wise, Kansas had the smallest clean energy jobs workforce, at 1.9 percent of its total workforce employed in clean energy jobs.
Breaking down the numbers The report from Clean Jobs Midwest found that energy efficiency work made up “well over half” of Iowa’s clean energy jobs.
Linn County is in second place statewide and 52nd across the Midwest with 2,778 clean energy jobs, while Scott County’s 1,886 clean energy jobs earns it the rank of 72nd across the Midwest.","The number of clean energy jobs in Iowa reached a record high in 2024, with more than 33,000 Iowans holding jobs in the clean energy space, surpassing the state’s previous record of 31,910 jobs in 2019.

Clean Jobs Midwest on Wednesday released its annual report, which tracks clean energy workforce growth across the Midwest and breaks down each state by county.

According to the report, clean energy jobs in Iowa grew six times faster than the state’s overall economy in 2024, resulting in a 2.8 percent jump — an increase of 917 workers statewide — in clean energy jobs compared to 2023.

“Clean energy’s economic role in the region is vital: the industry added jobs almost six times faster than Iowa’s overall economy, and nearly six times as many Iowans work in clean energy than the number of lawyers, web developers and real estate agents combined,” the report states.

The report also states that clean energy job growth is expected to “surge” in 2025 by about 3.6 percent.

This prediction comes as some federal clean energy programs and tax incentives — mainly created by the Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act — have been repealed under the Trump administration.

“If federal clean energy and clean vehicle incentives are rolled back, the job growth and resurgence of clean energy manufacturing could be at risk,” the report states.

Of the 12 Midwest states examined in the report, Micaela Preskill, director of state advocacy for E2 — a national nonprofit organization that advocate for smart energy policies — said all states saw clean energy job growth that outpaced each state’s economy.

However, Preskill noted that clean energy job growth did slow between 2023 and 2024. From 2022 to 2023, clean energy jobs in Iowa grew by 4.5 percent.

Preskill said some of that slowdown likely was anticipation of federal changes.

“Our survey looks at jobs up until the end of 2024, and I think a lot of industries were starting to pause and adjust as we got closer to more and more federal uncertainty, and that definitely impacted the industry,” Preskill said.

The Midwest region as a whole saw a 3.9 percent increase in clean energy jobs in 2023 as well.

Of the states examined in the study — which include Iowa, Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Missouri, Illinois, Indiana, Wisconsin, Michigan and Ohio — Iowa is in the middle of the pack for the number of clean energy workers per state.

Of the 12 Midwest states, North Dakota has the smallest clean energy workforce, with about 9,513 workers in 2024. Illinois has the largest, with about 132,239 clean energy workers employed statewide.

Percentage-wise, Kansas had the smallest clean energy jobs workforce, at 1.9 percent of its total workforce employed in clean energy jobs. Michigan had the largest percentage at 2.9 percent of its workforce in clean energy jobs. In Iowa, 2.2 percent of the workforce holds a clean energy job.

In presenting the information Wednesday, Preskill noted that the numbers in the report reflect the number of clean energy jobs per state before federal rollbacks to clean energy funding and the approval of the Trump administration’s One Big, Beautiful Bill.

She said the report is “both a snapshot of success and a warning of what's at stake” in regard to the clean energy industry.

Breaking down the numbers

The report from Clean Jobs Midwest found that energy efficiency work made up “well over half” of Iowa’s clean energy jobs.

Researchers found that 20,153 Iowans make up the energy efficiency workforce in Iowa, completing work like manufacturing ENERGY STAR-rated appliances, installing efficient lighting, connecting heat pumps and other highly efficient heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems.

The clean vehicle energy sector — including EVs and hybrid EVs — added about 331 new jobs for 4,135 workers across Iowa in 2024. Electric vehicle jobs experienced the steepest growth rate at about 9.8 percent.

Renewable energy job growth in solar also rose by about 13 percent, and wind energy jobs grew by 1.1 percent.

In Iowa, construction work made up about 51.6 percent of clean energy jobs, while the manufacturing sector made up about 17.9 percent.

And in 2024, about 10.1 percent of Iowa’s clean energy workforce was made up of veterans.

The report breaks down clean energy jobs by county. Polk County’s 7,082 clean energy workers is the most of any county in Iowa, and ranks 18 among the counties in all 12 Midwest states.

Linn County is in second place statewide and 52nd across the Midwest with 2,778 clean energy jobs, while Scott County’s 1,886 clean energy jobs earns it the rank of 72nd across the Midwest.

This investment comes after tariffs made imports from regions like Mexico, Canada, and Europe, where Stellantis operates some facilities, too costly.
President Donald Trump has said he wants more auto manufacturing in the U.S. Stellantis stock climbed higher, jumping over 5% in after-hours trading on the heels of the news.
This investment came after the departure of former CEO Carlos Tavares last year with Stellantis’ U.S. businesses faltering due to bloated inventory and higher prices.
GM had made a similar move earlier this year, committing $4 billion to expand its U.S. manufacturing capabilities.","Automaker Stellantis announced an investment of $13 billion as it seeks to expand its manufacturing footprint in the U.S. The company said the $13 billion spend, the largest in its 100-year history, would result in U.S. production jumping by 50% with five new vehicle launches and 5,000 new jobs over the next four years.

Five new vehicles will be developed and produced through 2029 as part of the investment into factories in Illinois, Ohio, Michigan, and Indiana. This investment will support the production of a new four-cylinder engine and reopen the Belvidere Assembly Plant in Illinois, which will allow the automaker to expand production of the Jeep Cherokee and Jeep Compass for the U.S. market. This would also create around 5,000 jobs across the country.

Unlike previous multi-billion-dollar investments, this one does not focus on electrification. One of the five new vehicles will be a range-extended EV produced at the Warren Truck Assembly Plant in Michigan beginning in 2028.

The remaining products include a next-generation Dodge Durango that will be produced at the Detroit Assembly Complex in 2029, a new midsize truck that will be assembled at its Toledo Assembly Complex in Ohio, and an all-new four-cylinder engine called the GMET4 EVO that will go into production beginning in 2026 at its factory in Kokomo, Indiana.

Antonio Filosa, the CEO and North America COO of Stellantis, said the investment will drive the automaker’s growth, strengthen its manufacturing footprint and “bring more American jobs to the states we call home.”

“Accelerating growth in the U.S. has been a top priority since my first day. Success in America is not just good for Stellantis in the U.S. — it makes us stronger everywhere,” he said in a statement.

This investment comes after tariffs made imports from regions like Mexico, Canada, and Europe, where Stellantis operates some facilities, too costly. President Donald Trump has said he wants more auto manufacturing in the U.S.

Stellantis stock climbed higher, jumping over 5% in after-hours trading on the heels of the news. Shares are trading around 1% higher in midday trade on Wednesday.

This investment came after the departure of former CEO Carlos Tavares last year with Stellantis’ U.S. businesses faltering due to bloated inventory and higher prices. GM had made a similar move earlier this year, committing $4 billion to expand its U.S. manufacturing capabilities.",https://americanbazaaronline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/stellantis.png,N,,2025-10-15 23:04:06.300519

Reed’s view

General Motors announced in a regulatory filing Tuesday that it was taking a $1.2 billion charge on its struggling electric vehicle business.

The subtext of its filing is just how much governments at every level dictate GM’s product road map, and has similar implications for tech overall.

A few years ago, GM thought gas-powered vehicles were going to be essentially outlawed in major US markets. Now, the $7,500 tax credit that made EV economics work is going away, and emissions standards, at least in the US, are being relaxed. GM has done its share of lobbying, too.

So the automaker is slowing its EV rollout, while reckoning with steel tariffs that favor foreign rivals, even as it frets about the ascendant Chinese auto industry.

AD

GM’s woes are the product of an American industrial policy that … is clearly not working the way industrial policy is supposed to. If you’re going to dictate what products your companies make, you can’t keep changing your mind between administrations.

But that’s now happening across tech, where the previous administration fought US companies in some areas and supported them in others. The current White House has different priorities, producing a regulatory whipsaw that is going to force companies to waste money and resources — even as they hasten to praise our wise leaders, whoever they happen to be.

In this article:

Room for Disagreement

Former Ford CEO Mark Fields said on Tuesday that car companies “went full bore” into making EVs without a clear understanding of consumer demand, adding that he expects GM to take further charges in the future. “This is clearly an issue where the market didn’t develop the way automakers thought,” he added, suggesting that changing White House policies aren’t completely to blame.

Notable

GM’s 2035 goal for electric vehicles “was aspirational” and “more an idea than a strategy,” Alan Baum, an auto analyst from Detroit, told Politico. “GM’s doing a better job than many of their competitors, but there’s obviously a relatively low ceiling because of the lack of supportive policy.”

The Trump administration’s rollback of EV incentives is not all bad for GM, like for many of its legacy peers: They can now go back to relying more heavily on their internal combustion engine vehicles and keep more of the profits, Bloomberg energy columnist Liam Denning wrote.

DirecTV adds AI avatars to TV breaks for personalized shopping

OpenAI eyes Argentina for data center expansion

Talent giant CAA taps lobbyists on Hollywood AI issues

DirecTV is injecting AI avatars of users, their families, and their pets into television breaks. In partnership with Indian AI company Glance, the TV giant is creating custom screensavers and videos that users can insert themselves into using Glance’s mobile app. They can then shop the products shown in the AI-generated scenes — such as clothing their avatar is wearing — using Glance’s reverse image search technology.

Users indicate their permission by uploading photos of themselves into the Glance app. Still, the capability highlights broader privacy concerns around the integration of AI into users’ homes, personal devices, and everyday lives. It is also a step towards understanding how advertising becomes embedded into generative technologies. Glance’s AI doesn’t currently market specific products in these scenes, but it opens the door for advertisers keen on finding the next frontier for consumer engagement.

OpenAI is exploring a large-scale data center project in Argentina as part of its first Stargate initiative in Latin America, the company announced Tuesday. The proposal could see an investment of up to $25 billion into the country, equivalent to roughly 4% of its gross domestic product last year. The ChatGPT maker is working with local energy firm Sur Energy as the infrastructure developer for the planned 500-megawatt facility, which will focus on advanced AI computing.

Argentina is one of the more developed AI markets in the region, especially with respect to available infrastructure. A new report by Chile’s national AI center and the UN’s Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean ranked it sixth in the region. While much of the world’s AI focus has been concentrated on the US, Europe, and China, Latin America is becoming a global hot spot for new data center builds. The investment could help the region diversify away from commodities and position it as a key cog in the digital supply chain.

Talent representation giant Creative Artists Agency has for the first time retained external lobbyists in Washington to protect actors as AI and other issues emerge, Politico reported. The move builds on the intensified lobbying efforts by Hollywood unions and production studios in recent years, as AI threatens to supplant creative roles and challenge the intellectual property rights of established talent. CAA’s decision signals the fight in Washington may be ramping up, with new players willing to stand up to an AI-friendly Trump administration.

Hollywood has already taken issue with AI several times recently. Earlier this month, a new AI actress drew criticism from the actors’ union. OpenAI’s latest video generation tool allows users to create content that includes the intellectual property of studios, who must opt out. The AI company was also in hot water with Scarlett Johansson last year over its launch of an AI voice that she claimed sounds similar to hers.

The World

at a Glance

Apple CEO Tim Cook vowed to increase investment in China, as trade tensions between Washington and Beijing force global tech firms into a delicate balancing act.

Cook, who met with China’s tech minister on Wednesday, notched a strategic win as Chinese regulators paved the way for Apple to release its new iPhone Air next week. Apple’s new investment pledge, though, risks irking US President Donald Trump, who previously blasted Cook over plans to move more iPhone production to India, rather than the US.

Apple still makes the bulk of its phones in China, even as it reduces dependency in other arenas: The company is building a slate of home devices, including a tabletop robot, in Vietnam.

The IMF on Wednesday issued a stark warning over soaring global government debt, saying it is on track to exceed 100% of GDP by 2029.

Such a ratio would be the highest since 1948, when large economies were rebuilding post-war. Today, “there is little political appetite for belt-tightening,” The Economist wrote: Rich nations are reluctant to raise taxes on their beleaguered electorates — but they’re facing pressure to spend more on defense, and on social services for aging populations. Higher long-term bond yields, meanwhile, suggest investor wariness over governments’ balance sheets.

In the short term, the debt concerns manifest in political disruption: France’s budget fight recently toppled another government, while the US federal shutdown highlights the tension between new spending demands and deficit reduction.

Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa met Russia’s Vladimir Putin on Wednesday as the Kremlin’s influence in the Middle East wanes.

The Moscow meeting was remarkable given that Russia is harboring Syria’s former president, Bashar al-Assad, whose government was overthrown by rebels led by al-Sharaa. Putin is keen to reboot relations with Damascus to maintain his country’s military bases in Syria, analysts said. But the Kremlin’s diminishing MidEast clout was put in stark relief this week as Arab leaders rushed to Egypt for a US-led Gaza peace summit, leading Moscow to cancel a Russia-Arab conference.

“Russia has not been sidelined diplomatically in the Middle East like this since it intervened in Syria in 2015,” one analyst said.

Israel warned Tuesday it would reduce the amount of aid flowing into Gaza over Hamas’ slow release of the remains of deceased hostages.

While the Gaza ceasefire deal required the immediate handover of all remaining bodies, Hamas said destruction in the enclave has made some difficult to locate. The back-and-forth provides an early test for the tenuous truce: US President Donald Trump also heaped pressure on Hamas, saying it must disarm or “we will disarm them… quickly and perhaps violently.”

Hamas, which returned more bodies after Israel’s threat, will “play along” with the ceasefire, an expert on the group wrote in Foreign Affairs. But it “will fight tooth and nail to preserve its political and military standing in Gaza.”

US President Donald Trump said that his country’s $20 billion bailout for Argentina was contingent on Javier Milei’s party prevailing in midterm elections.

Buenos Aires is suffering a currency crisis; in a meeting in Washington, Trump reiterated Washington’s willingness to help, but added that “if he loses, we are not going to be generous.” Milei and Trump consider themselves political bedfellows, although they have very different approaches: The libertarian Milei has removed tariffs and import controls, while Trump has imposed new ones.

Trump often ties diplomacy up with politics, though not always successfully: His comments during Canada’s election hurt the Conservative Party’s prospects, and Brazil’s left-wing leader has seen a poll boost following Trump’s criticism of him.

The US carried out another strike on a vessel off the Venezuelan coast, killing six and ramping up tensions between Washington and Caracas.

The US military has stepped up attacks on what President Donald Trump said are “narcoterrorists.” Trump did not specify the nationality of the victims, but the Navy has deployed several warships to the Caribbean Sea and stepped up pressure on Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro: One analyst told El País that the attacks are not about drugs but “bringing about a change of regime — a deeply corrupt and criminal regime” as cheaply as possible.

Experts have questioned the legality of the strikes, saying that simply designating drug smugglers as narcoterrorists does not make them lawful targets.

US President Donald Trump is seeking further diplomatic wins on the back of his success brokering a truce between Israel and Hamas.

The ceasefire is a diplomatic coup for Trump, who promised long-term peace in the Middle East. Insiders told The New York Times that Trump pushed Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu towards a deal, while also pressuring Hamas.

The victory has buoyed Trump, who is looking for new foreign policy wins: On Friday he meets with Ukrainian President Volodymy Zelenskyy, who said the breakthrough offers “hope” to end the Ukraine war. Trump also offered an olive branch to Iran, suggested intervening in fighting between Afghanistan and Pakistan, and the US may facilitate a ceasefire between Thailand and Cambodia.

A Chinese effort to attract top foreign scientists has been met with a domestic backlash.

Beijing recently advertised its new visa for leading experts as a step towards establishing China as the world’s leading scientific power. The visa was also seen as a way to lure talent that would have otherwise gone to the US, where new laws have priced out many would-be migrants. But the visa sparked anger within China — where youth unemployment is high — with prominent influencers accusing the government of inviting foreigners to steal domestic jobs, The New York Times reported.

One analyst who praised the plan was accused of being a race traitor, and other critics have voiced fears that China will be overrun by outsiders.

US President Donald Trump hosted Argentine leader Javier Milei at the White House on Tuesday as Washington races to finalize a $20 billion bailout for Buenos Aires.

The rare, direct foreign intervention, which will take the form of a currency swap, is aimed at boosting a collapsing peso and calming market volatility ahead of Argentina’s midterm elections later this month. That contest will determine if Milei maintains a political mandate to further his aggressive cost-cutting agenda.

The bailout looms over this week’s IMF and World Bank meetings and shows how Trump has merged politics and economics in his approach to Latin America, the BBC wrote: While he helps an ideological ally in Argentina, neighboring Brazil is grappling with 50% US tariffs.

A surge in dealmaking and trading boosted the profits of the largest US banks, though some CEOs warned that investor excitement fuels the risk of a bubble.

Wall Street banks are getting “their party hats on,” the Financial Times wrote, as the AI boom has helped prop up the private sector despite looming concerns over the labor market and inflation. While executives like Citi CEO Jane Fraser cautioned about “pockets of valuation frothiness,” the banks credited a “resilient” economy for their strong earnings.

The global economy has indeed held up this year despite trade and geopolitical turbulence, the IMF said Tuesday, lifting its 2025 GDP growth forecast to 3.2%.

Maritime shipping emerged as the latest flashpoint in the US-China trade war.

Both Washington and Beijing on Tuesday began charging new tit-for-tat port fees on each other’s ships; the levies are part of a ballooning economic conflict between the countries that flared up last week, cooled slightly over the weekend, and ramped back up Tuesday. In a move that could further dent ties, China sanctioned five US subsidiaries of a South Korean shipbuilder, alleging they cooperated with Washington’s probe of the Chinese maritime industry.

Global commerce has been under strain this year as companies grapple with a flurry of on-again, off-again trade policies; the new port fees will likely make shipping rates more volatile, analysts said.

US President Donald Trump led a “peace summit” of world leaders on a whirlwind trip to the Middle East, hailing the end of the war in Gaza, but analysts said major sticking points could block lasting peace.

Trump flew to Israel and then Egypt to cement an end to a two-year conflict that saw upwards of 1,200 Israelis and 67,000 Palestinians die and upended the balance of power in the Middle East. Trump’s victory lap came as hostages held in Gaza and Palestinian prisoners in Israel returned home. Yet there is still a “big gap” between Israel and the Arab world on the pathway to a two-state solution, one analyst told The Washington Post.

The Gaza peace plan was a diplomatic coup for US President Donald Trump, analysts said, drawing praise from even his political foes.

World leaders were summoned to Egypt at short notice — “like 20 minutes” in some cases, according to Trump — to witness the signing of a document committing to supporting peace between Israelis and Palestinians. The event offered “a brutal lesson in realpolitik,” The Guardian said, with leaders jockeying to position themselves next to Trump.

Even former US President Joe Biden, who sharply criticized Trump during two election campaigns, casting him as a threat to democracy, commended him for pulling it off. It was “a stunning display of personal and presidential power,” NBC’s chief international correspondent wrote.

SpaceX’s Starship, the biggest and most powerful spacecraft ever launched, successfully completed its 11th test flight, bringing the company closer to sending humans to other worlds.

SpaceX CEO Elon Musk wants to take humans to the moon, and eventually Mars. NASA chose Starship to carry its crewed lander on its Artemis missions, which hope to put astronauts on the lunar surface in 2027.

Test flights seven, eight, and nine ended in “rapid unexpected disassembly,” but this and the last performed well, with the splashdown in the Indian Ocean so accurate that it landed within sight of a camera buoy which captured the ship’s last moments. This iteration of the rocket is the last before an even larger variant is built.

The US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent accused China of deliberately harming the global economy, as tensions between Beijing and Washington reignited again after an apparent reprieve.

The superpowers imposed punishing tariffs on one another earlier this year, only to lower them, and had for months been discussing a trade deal. The mood has soured recently, though, with each side imposing additional curbs; new US tariffs come into effect today.

US officials signaled openness to a trade deal yesterday, leading to a brief stock rally, but the diplomatic tone has toughened. Bessent told the Financial Times that Beijing wants to “pull everybody else down,” while China said: “If there’s a fight, we’ll fight… if there’s a talk, the door is open.”

Lead poisoning, all but eradicated in the West, still harms millions of children in the developing world, with lead-acid battery recycling a key culprit.

Car batteries contain about $15 worth of lead, a significant sum in the Global South. Informal salvage businesses buy old batteries and melt the lead in makeshift furnaces, releasing waste that ends up in the air, soil, and water.

An estimated one in three children worldwide — 800 million — have blood lead levels as high as those in Flint, Michigan’s 2014 water crisis. Lead is a neurotoxin that impairs brain development. Fixing the problem should be simple, Vox reported: Removing taxes on licensed, safer recyclers, allowing them to compete with unlicensed ones, would be a start.

US President Donald Trump urged Israel to seize the chance for peace and called on Palestinians to turn “forever from the path of terror” in a speech to the Israeli parliament Monday, hours after Hamas released all 20 living hostages.

Trump received a hero’s welcome by the Knesset — as well as being briefly heckled by a left-wing member, who was promptly escorted out — after brokering a ceasefire that raised hopes for lasting peace in the region.

“Generations from now, this will be remembered as the moment that everything began to change,” Trump told lawmakers, describing the truce as “the end of the age of terror and death.”

It came amid scenes of jubilation in Tel Aviv, where huge numbers gathered for public screenings of the hostages being released. Shortly after, bus-loads of Palestinian prisoners freed by Israel arrived in the occupied West Bank city of Ramallah, AFP reported.

Trump used his address to say it would be “great to get a peace deal” with Iran, Israel’s other major conflict, after the US aided the Jewish state in striking Tehran’s nuclear sites earlier this year.

Analysts are skeptical over whether the Gaza peace agreement — which calls for a full disarmament of Hamas, among other vexxing issues — will be fully implemented, even as its initial phase looked to be unfolding as hoped.

US stocks bounced back Monday on signs that Washington’s trade tensions with China were easing, coupled with deescalation in the Middle East.

Following Wall Street’s worst selloff since April on Friday, top US officials signaled openness to a trade deal with Beijing to resolve a fresh spat over rare earth exports. Optimism over a permanent peace in Gaza following a landmark ceasefire deal also buoyed global markets as traders reassessed the geopolitical risk premium that has dominated sentiment.

Wall Street is confident heading into earnings season, as the big banks begin reporting Tuesday: A rebound in dealmaking has boosted bank stocks, but thorny issues like AI spending and tariffs will loom over the corporate reports, Bloomberg wrote.

The Dutch government took control of a Chinese-owned chipmaker, a rare intervention that threatens to escalate tensions between Beijing and the West over access to critical technologies.

Citing national security concerns, the Netherlands said it was worried about Nexperia possibly transferring tech to its Chinese parent company, Wingtech, which in response accused the Dutch government of “geopolitical bias.” Wingtech is already on a US blacklist amid broader pressure aimed at curbing Beijing’s tech advances.

The Nexperia takeover, which sparked speculation about possible Chinese countermeasures aimed at Dutch firms, is an “escalation of an existing trend,” with governments pressuring companies to unravel assets deemed geopolitical risks, the Financial Times wrote.

The economics Nobel went to three researchers who showed how growth is driven by “creative destruction.”

Joel Mokyr, Philippe Aghion, and Peter Howitt demonstrated that innovation is what pushes economies forwards: New technologies and methods drive out old ones, sometimes destroying a sector of the economy — and some jobs — but improving the quality of our lives overall.

A classic example would be the growth of mechanized farming, which put millions of farmers out of work but led to a richer and better-fed world. Mokyr took half the award, for identifying the mechanism, while Aghion and Howitt shared the other half, for creating the mathematical model for how products enter the market and drive older ones out.

Chinese trade figures beat expectations, suggesting Beijing may be weathering pressure from Washington amid intensifying tariff threats from the White House.

The upbeat export and import data came despite trade with the US cratering, indicating Chinese firms are finding new markets for their goods.

The figures came after US President Donald Trump threatened an extra 100% duty on Chinese goods in response to Beijing tightening curbs on exports of rare earths, heightening tensions ahead of a potential meeting between Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping this month.

“Neither China nor the US wishes to return to mutually damaging tit-for-tat escalations and retaliations,” ING’s China chief economist wrote. “However, the past few weeks show that the possibility of miscalculation is always present.”

A coup is under way in Madagascar, the country’s presidency said. Madagascar has seen weeks of protests, initially spurred by shortages of water and power but now encompassing deeper unhappiness over corruption, inflation, and high unemployment.

Demonstrators have gathered in the capital Antananarivo, and there are reports of shooting between police and the army. The protests are led by a youth movement which uses symbols — including a pirate flag from popular Japanese manga One Piece, a stand-in for confronting oppression — associated with demonstrations in other countries, including Morocco, Nepal, and Peru. Yet Madagascar has its own history of upheaval: The army has led several coups since the country’s independence from France in 1960, most recently in 2009.

US President Donald Trump said he was considering sending long-range missiles to Ukraine for use against Russia, as part of what appears to be strengthening military cooperation between Washington and Kyiv.

Ties between the US and Ukraine frayed at the beginning of Trump’s term, illustrated by a heated Oval Office exchange between Trump and his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

But relations now look to be improving: Washington has for months been providing intelligence to Kyiv to mount aerial attacks on Russian energy facilities, the Financial Times said, and Trump told reporters on Sunday he may demand Russian President Vladimir Putin seriously commit to peace talks, or face the US transferring Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine.

Sébastien Lecornu, who resigned as French prime minister last Monday before being reappointed on Friday, named the first cabinet of his new tenure.

His previous attempt to appoint ministers prompted a broad parliamentary revolt and thus his resignation, making him the shortest-serving premier in France’s modern history. Four days later, President Emmanuel Macron reappointed him.

Macron has now had either seven or eight prime ministers in his presidency, including either four or five in 12 months, depending on whether you count Lecornu twice. The new cabinet, containing many of the same figures as the last one, faces the same challenges: A minority government, and convincing a hostile parliament to pass an unpopular but economically necessary budget.

The White House is considering invoking the Insurrection Act as officials ramp up federal law enforcement action in US cities, Vice President JD Vance said.

The 1807 statute would allow President Donald Trump to deploy active-duty military personnel; the government has already sent National Guard troops to Democratic-run cities with the stated aim of protecting immigration agents from protests.

Courts have blocked some of those deployments, but analysts say the legal setbacks could push Trump to take a more aggressive route and invoke the act.

Top Trump adviser Stephen Miller has called the unfavorable court rulings a “legal insurrection,” but polls show that most Americans oppose using active troops in US cities.

Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro called opposition leader María Corina Machado a “demonic witch” in his first comments since she won the Nobel Peace Prize.

Maduro is under pressure: The award has concentrated international attention on his regime, and the US military has repeatedly struck alleged Venezuelan vessels as part of its attacks on Caracas-backed drug-smuggling networks.

There is more US firepower in the Caribbean Sea than Washington committed to the Battle of Midway, Americas Quarterly reported. Maduro did not mention Machado by name, but said “90% of the population rejects the demonic witch.”

Deadly clashes erupted along Afghanistan’s border with Pakistan, marking a new low in the countries’ ties since the Taliban retook power in 2021.

The violence killed dozens of Pakistani soldiers and Taliban fighters and comes days after Islamabad bombed an Afghan market close to the border, alleging it held a terrorist base.

Pakistan has accused Afghanistan’s Taliban government of offering a safe haven to militants carrying out cross-border attacks.

The confrontations, while risking a broader conflict, also pose a geopolitical opportunity for India, which has cautiously sought to improve relations with the Taliban, perhaps filling the diplomatic hole left by its regional rival, Pakistan, analysts said.

China on Sunday vowed countermeasures against the US if President Donald Trump imposes a further 100% duty on Beijing, escalating the countries’ spat over rare earth minerals.

Trump made his latest tariff threat on Friday after China imposed new restrictions on rare earth exports.

Both sides are digging in: US Vice President JD Vance said settling the dispute will be a “delicate dance,” but Washington has “far more cards” than Beijing, which signaled it is “not afraid” of a trade war.

US stocks tumbled after Trump went on the offensive; a broader deterioration of ties could also imperil China’s recent market rally and cast fresh doubts over the country’s investability.

Green turtles, once on the brink of extinction, have bounced back, a new report found.

The species is one of the world’s largest sea turtles, and humans have long hunted it to make turtle soup and to eat its eggs as a delicacy; it has been listed as endangered by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature since the 1980s.

But conservation efforts, including protecting buried eggs and releasing hatchlings to avoid predators and accidental capture in fishing nets, have helped their numbers recover, although the population remains far below its pre-industrial peak.

Other animals have been less fortunate: Notably, more than half of all bird species were found to be “in decline.”

US President Donald Trump threatened a “massive increase” of tariffs on China on Friday, arguing it was necessary to “financially counter” new rare earth export controls that China has imposed on America.

Posting on Truth Social, Trump said that there was no way that China “should be allowed to hold the World “captive”″ over its export policies. He added that Beijing’s new policy meant that there was “no reason” to hold a planned meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping in South Korea later this month.

Stocks dropped on the announcement, with the S&P 500 falling as much as 1.7%.","https://img.semafor.com/6fe0185046c9c13c5a942558b6b68720b328fb90-5459x3693.jpg?rect=0,414,5459,2866&w=1200&h=630&q=75&auto=format",N,,2025-10-15 21:04:27.362199

The wind sector is particularly badly hit, with projections of a mere 1.8% in capacity growth in the current year, the lowest since 2010, largely due to policy headwinds by the Trump administration including the cancellation of hundreds of millions in offshore wind funding as well as freezing permitting for offshore wind projects.

China is the global leader in clean energy innovation, including in the manufacturing, large-scale deployment, investment, and the development of new technologies like fast-charging electric vehicles. The country's dominance in the supply chain for key clean energy technologies like solar panels, wind turbines, and batteries is significant, supported by decades of strategic planning and massive government and private investments. In April, Chinese scientists unveiled the world’s first operational thorium reactor. According to Guangming Daily, the 2-megawatt experimental reactor is located in the Gobi Desert, and the latest milestone puts China at the forefront in the race to build a practical thorium reactor–long considered a more abundant and safer alternative to uranium. More significantly, China relied heavily on long-abandoned American research in the field. In the 1960s, American scientists built and tested molten salt reactors, but Washington eventually shelved the program in favor of uranium-based technology. “The US left its research publicly available, waiting for the right successor. We were that successor,” project chief scientist Xu Hongjie said. “Rabbits sometimes make mistakes or grow lazy. That’s when the tortoise seizes its chance,” he added.

U.S. based companies and startups are still pursuing patents near historically high levels, including in the battery and electric vehicle sectors. These companies use these patents as tools or corporate assets to achieve various business objectives such as creation of barriers to entry, protection of competitive differentiators and protection of market share, among other important uses. The fact that the vast majority of cleantech innovations are now happening outside the United States makes it harder to find non-U.S. prior art especially for overbroad patent portfolios. Prior art documents are any publicly available information that existed before the filing date of a patent application, such as patents, publications, websites, and products, that can be used to determine if an invention is novel and non-obvious. Patent examiners use prior art to decide if an invention meets the criteria for being new and not an obvious modification of what already exists. Patents experts are increasingly advising their clients to prepare at least a part of their patent portfolio in a more narrow manner to lower the risk of future litigations airing from unconsidered prior art arising that can result in significant legal costs.

Recent patent cases involving U.S. energy companies include Tigo Energy's (NASDAQ:TYGO) settlement with SMA over solar technology and Maxeon Solar's (NASDAQ:MAXN) lawsuits against competitors like Canadian Solar (NASDAQ:CSIQ) and REC Solar for allegedly infringing on its TOPCon solar panel technology. Tigo Energy reached a multi-year settlement with SMA in May 2025 to end a patent infringement lawsuit concerning Tigo's rapid shutdown technology for solar systems. Tigo filed the lawsuit in July 2022, alleging that SMA infringed on several of its patents related to rapid shutdown features required by the U.S. National Electrical Code (NEC). The settlement concluded the legal dispute, though the specific terms remain confidential. Meanwhile, Maxeon Solar sued Canadian Solar in March 2024 for infringing on its patents for TOPCon solar cell technology, alleging that Canadian Solar's n-type solar panels with TOPCon cells violate its intellectual property. This lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas and is part of a broader effort by Maxeon to protect its patents against companies that make, import, or sell TOPCon products. Canadian Solar has indicated it will defend itself against the claims.

Failure to consider them leads to projects paying unnecessarily high grid upgrade costs, projects dropping out of the queue, and customers paying unjust and unreasonable rates.","Congressman Don Beyer (D-VA) today led 21 U.S. Representatives representing districts within the PJM Interconnection service territory, the largest power grid operator in the United States, to demand that PJM take key steps to address skyrocketing energy bills for American households. The Members stressed that PJM must use current information and technologies, particularly on batteries and Alternative Transmission Technologies (ATTs), to fully comply with FERC Order 2023 and lower energy costs.

In a letter addressed to PJM Interconnection’s President and CEO they wrote:

“Dear Mr. Asthana:

As members of Congress serving constituents within the PJM Interconnection service territory, we have a significant interest in ensuring that PJM is providing affordable electricity to its customers. There have been stark increases in electricity rates for our constituents. Some of our districts are facing electricity rate increases above 20 percent, and these unacceptably higher bills are coming when many households are already struggling to keep up with a higher cost of living. These rate increases are unaffordable and necessitate that PJM respond effectively to pursue reforms to the interconnection process that would address and prevent current and future rate hikes.

In the face of rising electricity demand, including from data centers, electrification, and increased manufacturing, it is paramount that PJM work to connect and approve new power generation projects expeditiously. Despite the predictable rise in demand, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory found PJM’s interconnection queue to be amongst the most backlogged in the country, even after PJM froze the queue from accepting new applicants for several years. The average project in the queue is waiting several years for an interconnection agreement. Additionally, when projects do get through the backlogged queue, they are assessed with sky-high network upgrade costs. Because PJM has neglected to proactively support planning or building sufficient new transmission lines, each project in the queue is paying high costs for new transmission lines.

Given that more rapid interconnection could have saved our constituents from these price shocks, we feel it imperative to urge PJM to address the interconnection issue with urgency, beyond the initial reforms already undertaken. In July, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) rejected parts of PJM’s compliance filing for Order No. 2023, Improvements to Generator Interconnection Procedures and Agreements. In particular, FERC found PJM’s filing inadequate regarding: charging assumptions and high grid upgrade costs for battery storage projects and consideration of Alternative Transmission Technologies (ATTs). We agree with FERC’s finding and the need to address these compliance gaps as past reforms and practices are insufficient and request that PJM fully address each of these shortfalls in its refiling, due October 22 of this year.

It's concerning that when battery storage projects are a low-cost technology and quick way to add capacity to the existing grid, PJM insists on relying upon on outdated and conservative charging assumptions to unfairly make battery projects uneconomic, contributing to the low penetration of this key technology compared to other regions that have deployed nearly 50 times more capacity and where batteries are helping maintain reliability. In its order, FERC found that PJM’s Order 2023 compliance proposal on operating assumptions for energy storage resources represented “an impermissible collateral attack on the final rule.” In this era of rising prices, PJM must cease its attacks on FERC’s final rule, acknowledge its requirements, and ensure that its updated compliance proposal later this month fully accounts for FERC’s orders on energy storage assumptions.

PJM must also consider all enumerated ATTs for all projects and report transparently on their evaluation. ATTs can provide substantial benefits due to their quicker deployment and lower costs compared to traditional network upgrades. Failure to consider them leads to projects paying unnecessarily high grid upgrade costs, projects dropping out of the queue, and customers paying unjust and unreasonable rates. This failure has contributed to the capacity auction shortfalls and higher prices we are seeing today. While we appreciate that PJM’s newly-developed Technical Reference Guide pushes the consideration of ATT’s, a requirement for them to be considered must be codified within PJM’s tariff.

We fully expect PJM to comply with FERC’s direction on these topics, and urge PJM to make haste in achieving the 1-2 year interconnection study timelines it promises in its compliance filing. Our constituents and their pocketbooks are counting on it.

Beyond FERC Order No. 2023, we urge PJM to pursue deeper interconnection reforms to bring much-needed capacity online quickly and to achieve these interconnection study timelines. Other grid operators have seen great results come from so-called “connect and manage” techniques, and PJM should work to make its energy-only interconnection pathway, the Energy Resource Interconnection Service, easier to use and faster than alternatives. The reality is that the grid – and our constituents – need power as soon as possible, and PJM should be pursuing every available opportunity to hook clean power up to the grid.

While PJM’s announced partnership with Tapestry to consider study automation was a step in the right direction, PJM lags behind other regions in pursuing these vital software solutions. We are concerned that automation efforts won’t deliver faster study timelines for years to come, and we ask you to accelerate these efforts and implement automation solutions within the next year.

We are further concerned by your efforts to prioritize some resource types over others, namely natural gas plants. After promising that the Reliability Resource Initiative (RRI) was a “one-time” queue jumping mechanism, PJM proposed a new “Expedited Interconnection Track” within the large load Critical Issue Fast Path. This new track would once again come before the first cycle of its regular queue is opened. This contradicts testimony that Mr. Asim Haque, PJM’s Senior Vice President for Governmental and Member Services, gave at an Energy and Commerce Committee hearing in March of this year, when he confirmed that the RRI intervention was a one-time solution, and that PJM was working to create an interconnection process that did not need manual interventions. Any proposal to again authorize queue interventions would be in immediate legal jeopardy and would waste time that PJM and our constituents do not have.

We fear that a focus on new queue-jumping fast tracks for certain resource types or projects serving certain customers betrays a lack of seriousness in fixing the regular-order queue. We urge PJM to focus instead on speeding interconnection studies for the hundreds of projects, primarily low-cost clean energy and storage, that have been lingering in PJM’s queue for years—and to open the queue to new applicants as soon as possible.

If PJM is serious about fixing the cost crisis it has had a role in shaping — the organization must take responsibility for the parts of the project development process it does control and fully address each of the above matters in its revised Order No. 2023 compliance filing while making deeper reforms to speed interconnection. Anything else would be a dereliction of PJM’s duty to provide electricity to our constituents at just and reasonable rates.”

Tony Evers is urging the Trump administration not to roll back previously awarded funds in the face of rising energy costs.

Evers’ response, in a letter to U.S. Department of Energy Secretary Chris Wright, followed multiple news reports in the last week about energy projects on target lists for cancellation.

The governor’s office has compiled a list of 22 projects for which federal Energy Department funding totaling $1.56 billion has been marked for cancellation.

“Federal support plays a critical role in advancing the Wisconsin Idea and American innovation, lowering energy bills for families across America, supporting clean energy development to improve energy independence and resilience, creating good-paying jobs in innovative industries and sectors, and maintaining our nation’s leadership in science and technology,” Evers wrote Tuesday in his letter to Wright.

“Given these clear benefits and the importance of these investments to Wisconsin’s and our nation’s economy, I was deeply concerned to see reporting last week containing a list of over 600 DOE funding awards that are potentially going to be targeted for termination with no clear reasoning or justification.”

Evers’ letter mentions several Wisconsin projects and companies on the target list, including several that the Wisconsin Examiner reported on this week.

The letter also notes forecasts of rising costs for electric power that the energy policy think tank Energy Innovation attributes to the tax and spending cut megabill that President Donald Trump signed July 4.

“Terminating these funding awards at a time of record-high energy demand and rising costs would be counterintuitive, reckless and ill-advised,” Evers concludes in his letter to Wright. “I urge you to reaffirm DOE’s commitment to honoring these funding awards and to continue supporting these investments that drive Wisconsin’s and the nation’s energy landscape forward.”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-99/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/pxl_20250304_191115239-1024x5761760566605.jpg?h=c12e0b96&itok=fVK-U7RP,N,,2025-10-15 21:05:50.006985

Shared EV chargers can also be found at apartment complexes, workplaces, doctors’ offices, sports facilities, and other parking areas with restricted access.

California motorists purchased 124,755 zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs) in Q3 2025, a spike of nearly 30% over the previous quarter, according to the Governor's Office. The previous high of 26.9% of total car sales was set in Q3 2023.

This comes after last month's announcement that clean truck sales rose in California in 2024, with manufacturers reporting nearly 1 in 4 trucks, buses, and vans sold were zero-emission.

Californians have purchased 2,468,158 new ZEVs, surpassing the state's goal of 1.5 million ZEVs on California roads by 2025.

""This is unprecedented, we’re nearing a third of all new vehicles sold in the fourth largest economy on the planet being clean cars. We’re setting new records because this state believes in innovation, not isolation,"" said Gov. Gavin Newsom in a statement. ""While Trump sells out American innovation to China, California will keep charging ahead on our path to a future of cleaner air.”

Federal tax credits cut in 'Big Beautiful Bill'

The recent surge in ZEV purchases is attributed to the Sept. 30 expiration of the federal tax credit, which offered up to $7,500 for new EVs and $4,000 for used models.

Originally set to expire in 2032 as part of the Inflation Reduction Act, the Biden-era incentives were eliminated in HR 1 - ""The Big Beautiful Bill,"" signed by President Trump in July.

The lapsed federal tax credits meant significant savings to consumers, as reported by EnergySage. A $7,500 credit represented a 13% discount towards the $57,245 average cost of a new electric vehicle in August, according to Kelly Blue Book.

""Despite the efforts by the Trump administration to derail the ZEV industry and raise the cost of a clean car, Californians made it clear they want to drive ZEVs as they scooped up the remaining federal tax credits that expired at the end of last month,"" the California governor's statement continued.

Are there any EV tax credits still available?

While no federal tax credits exist and the popular California Clean Vehicle Rebate Project expired in 2023, grants and rebates are available for low-income Californians to purchase ZEVs, with information available at ClimateAction.ca.gov or ElectricForAll.org.

Californians may also find EV purchase incentives depending on where they live.

Generally offered by utility providers, the rebates vary in amount and scope. For example, Los Angeles Department of Water and Power customers can get rebates up to $4,000 on used electric or plug-in hybrid vehicles.

The San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District's Drive Clean in the San Joaquin Rebate Program provides rebates up to $3,000 to Valley residents and businesses to purchase or lease new, clean-air vehicles.

Rebates are not always guaranteed, can change, or programs can run out of funds, so a good rule of thumb is to regularly check your local utility or district for the most up-to-date information.

Where to find reliable EV chargers

If you are about to buy an EV or are one of the millions of Californians who already own one, finding a reliable charging station will be at your mind.

In California, there are now over 200,000 publicly accessible EV charging stations, announced the state last month.

Their state is also about to get a whole lot more.

The California Energy Commission also recently approved two National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) Formula Program projects to build 64 fast EV chargers along key highway corridors.

The commission also approved three grants totaling more than $10 million that will build out more than 1,000 Level 2 EV charging ports, the vast majority in low-income, disadvantaged, or affordable multifamily housing complexes throughout the state.

EV chargers are available at grocery stores, park and ride lots, and gas stations.

Shared EV chargers can also be found at apartment complexes, workplaces, doctors’ offices, sports facilities, and other parking areas with restricted access.

“Terminating these funding awards at a time of record-high energy demand and rising costs would be counterintuitive, reckless, and ill-advised,” Evers wrote.
A new report from clean energy groups found about 75,000 Wisconsinites work in renewable energy, energy efficiency, electric vehicle manufacturing and other related fields.","Gov. Tony Evers is calling on the Trump administration to preserve more than $1.5 billion in federal energy grants allocated in Wisconsin.

The U.S. Department of Energy is reportedly considering terminating more than 600 Biden-era funding awards across the country that total almost $24 billion. That’s up from the agency’s announcement earlier this month that it would terminate 321 financial awards totaling about $7.5 billion in funding.

Among the more than 600 potential terminations are 22 awards to Wisconsin companies, organizations and projects that collectively could face more than $1.5 billion in lost funding, according to the governor’s office and a document obtained by business publication Latitude Media.

Evers sent a letter to U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright on Tuesday, urging the administration to reconsider any plans to halt Department of Energy funding previously allocated to projects and organizations in the state.

“Terminating these funding awards at a time of record-high energy demand and rising costs would be counterintuitive, reckless, and ill-advised,” Evers wrote. “I urge you to reaffirm DOE’s commitment to honoring these funding awards and to continue supporting these investments that drive Wisconsin’s and the nation’s energy landscape forward.”

The U.S. Department of Energy did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Evers’ letter. In a press release announcing the initial funding termination, Wright said the agency was reviewing billions of dollars in awards “rushed through in the final months of the Biden administration.”

“Rest assured, the Energy Department will continue reviewing awards to ensure that every dollar works for the American people,” Wright said in a statement.

At least two of the organizations identified by the governor’s office as being in danger of losing funding say they haven’t been notified of any changes to their awards.

Madison-based Alliant Energy could lose $80.7 million, according to the document. That’s broken into two awards of $50 million and $30.7 million. The up to $50 million would help bring smart grid technology to rural and underserved communities, while the $30.7 million would support a state-of-the-art energy storage system in Columbia County.

In a statement, Alliant Energy spokesperson Cindy Tomlinson said the utility is aware that the Trump administration and the Department of Energy are “working through their budgets and have notified some businesses of changes to grant announcements.”

“At this time, we have not been made aware of any changes to the announced DOE grants for our Alliant Energy projects,” Tomlinson said. “We are optimistic the value and viability of these projects is clear and that they will remain fully funded. These projects deliver economic and customer benefits.”

La Crosse-based Dairyland Power Cooperative could lose $28 million, according to the document. That money would support the development of three battery storage facilities in Dairyland’s rural service area.

Dairyland spokesperson Katie Thomson said in a statement that the cooperative “has not received any communication from the U.S. Department of Energy regarding a change in project status.”

“We remain committed to serving our members and supporting the region with safe, reliable, innovative and cost-competitive electricity,” Thomson said.

Of the awards identified in Wisconsin, the largest potential funding loss would be $925 million for the Heartland Hydrogen Hub, according to the governor’s office. The Heartland Hydrogen Hub is a regional partnership to produce low-carbon hydrogen and create energy and agriculture jobs in six states, including Wisconsin.

The Heartland Hydrogen Hub did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Other Wisconsin entities that could lose out on funding include Harley-Davidson, Johnson Controls, Generac Power Systems, Kohler Co., the Universities of Wisconsin and the city of Kaukauna, according to the document and the governor’s office. Those entities either declined to comment or did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Department of Energy awards to those entities included $89 million awarded to Harley to support electric motorcycle manufacturing in Pennsylvania and $33 million to Johnson Controls to support domestic heat pump manufacturing, according to press announcements matching dollar amounts from the governor’s office.

Amy Barrilleaux, a spokesperson for the nonprofit Clean Wisconsin, said the reports reflect the “uncertainty and chaos coming from the Trump administration.” She said it’s another sign of the administration’s preference toward fossil fuels.

“These investments were about looking forward,” she said. “They’re about energy efficiency, about making sure our grid is ready for the demands of climate change and other issues that we’re experiencing right now.”

Alex Beld, a spokesperson for the nonprofit RENEW Wisconsin, said federal funding cuts could slow job growth in the clean energy sector.

A new report from clean energy groups found about 75,000 Wisconsinites work in renewable energy, energy efficiency, electric vehicle manufacturing and other related fields.

“Jobs in that industry are growing at a rate of about four-and-a-half times of the rest of the economy, so we’d be putting that growth at risk,” Beld said.",https://www.wpr.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AP25175619817069-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-15 19:06:57.225692

The move follows the cancellation of a key federal initiative promoting EV purchases, which is expected to cause a steep drop in demand.

Breakdown of GM’s $1.6 billion hit

GM’s charges include “non-cash impairment and other charges of $1.2 billion as a result of adjustments to our EV capacity,” the automaker said in a public filing on Tuesday. The remaining $400 million will have a cash impact, mainly related to contract cancellation fees and commercial settlements tied to EV investments, the company explained.

Early EV gamble fails to pay off

The Detroit-based manufacturer was one of the first in the United States to make a major commitment to electric vehicles, a decision that hasn’t delivered the expected returns. GM currently produces the widest range of EV models in the country and holds a 13.8% market share, second only to Tesla’s 43.1%.

However, the overall market is considerably smaller than anticipated just a few years ago. In October 2021, GM announced plans to spend $35 billion on EV and autonomous vehicle development by 2025, a plan that was scaled back.

Impact of policy changes and slowing demand

In Tuesday’s filing, GM acknowledged it now expects “adoption rates of EVs to slow,” largely due to the Trump administration scrapping the $7,500 tax credit for EV buyers that had been introduced under President Biden.

“The charge doesn’t come as a surprise given recent market developments and the fact GM had made probably the most aggressive EV push of any traditional automaker,” Garrett Nelson, a senior equity analyst at CFRA Research, told Reuters.

Industrywide struggles with EV strategy

Ford Motor, one of GM’s main competitors, has also announced a $1.9 billion charge tied to its EV business. Industry insiders warn that more bad news could follow for automakers navigating the volatile electric market.

“I think we’re going to see multibillion-dollar write-downs flooding the headlines for the next few years,” Bank of America analyst John Murphy said in June.

Another financial blow after tariff impact

The $1.6 billion charge follows a $1.1 billion hit GM took in the second quarter of 2025, primarily due to tariffs imposed by President Trump.

Our investment in Aligned Data Centers will direct scalable capital to an operator built for efficiency and growth, with the mission to deliver the infrastructure needed to support global AI adoption.” Ahmed Yahia Al Idrissi, managing director and CEO of MGX and vice chairman of AIP, said.

Bayo Ogunlesi, chairman and CEO of Global Infrastructure Partners, a part of BlackRock, said the deal will have lasting impact.

“AI is reshaping every sector of the global economy,” Ogunlesi said. “By combining Aligned’s scalable, adaptable platform with AIP’s capital and capabilities, we will build the infrastructure to support innovation at scale—creating resilient, sustainable communities and unlocking transformative growth worldwide.”

Tony Evers is urging the Trump administration not to roll back previously awarded funds in the face of rising energy costs.

Evers’ response, in a letter to U.S. Department of Energy Secretary Chris Wright, followed multiple news reports in the last week about energy projects on target lists for cancellation.

The governor’s office has compiled a list of 22 projects for which federal Energy Department funding totaling $1.56 billion has been marked for cancellation.

“Federal support plays a critical role in advancing the Wisconsin Idea and American innovation, lowering energy bills for families across America, supporting clean energy development to improve energy independence and resilience, creating good-paying jobs in innovative industries and sectors, and maintaining our nation’s leadership in science and technology,” Evers wrote Tuesday in his letter to Wright.

“Given these clear benefits and the importance of these investments to Wisconsin’s and our nation’s economy, I was deeply concerned to see reporting last week containing a list of over 600 DOE funding awards that are potentially going to be targeted for termination with no clear reasoning or justification.”

Evers’ letter mentions several Wisconsin projects and companies on the target list, including several that the Wisconsin Examiner reported on this week.

The letter also notes forecasts of rising costs for electric power that the energy policy think tank Energy Innovation attributes to the tax and spending cut megabill that President Donald Trump signed July 4.

“Terminating these funding awards at a time of record-high energy demand and rising costs would be counterintuitive, reckless and ill-advised,” Evers concludes in his letter to Wright. “I urge you to reaffirm DOE’s commitment to honoring these funding awards and to continue supporting these investments that drive Wisconsin’s and the nation’s energy landscape forward.”",https://wisconsinexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/PXL_20250304_191115239-2048x1152.jpg,N,,2025-10-15 19:06:42.714984

The Louisiana Department of Conservation and Energy is ordered to reevaluate the status of Class VI permit applications over the next 45 days. Landry explained that the order is to give residents and local officials a “clear roadmap” to ensure that applications for proposed projects follow state rules for carbon injection and carbon dioxide pipelines.

Landry said it is necessary that the department can take a methodical approach to application review and permitting, with safety for people and the environment in mind.

Industry groups release statements

Statement from the Louisiana Association of Business and Industry.

“Louisiana’s energy sector is the envy of the nation and the world. The expertise and talent of our workforce, combined with the state’s abundant natural resources, make the state a global destination for energy investment and innovation. LABI’s commitment to ensuring that Louisiana remains a top destination for investment, technological advancement and job creation is ironclad.

“While this appears to be a shared goal of the Landry administration, today’s executive

order on carbon capture and sequestration sends the wrong message. The order risks

ceding Louisiana’s competitive advantage to neighboring states eager to move forward with CCS investments.

“Carbon capture and sequestration is a key piece to growing and retaining the high-wage energy, industrial and manufacturing jobs that sustain Louisiana families, while also ensuring the long-term viability of our state’s oil, gas and petrochemical industries.

“Louisiana has already secured billions of dollars in CCS-related investments from

companies committed to delivering products and energy safely and efficiently with a lower carbon footprint. These projects generate millions in local tax revenue, supporting infrastructure improvements, school upgrades and economic development in communities.

“The momentum Louisiana has built is no accident. It is the direct result of securing state primacy and leveraging our unique geology, world-class energy infrastructure and highly skilled workforce. Together, these advantages have positioned Louisiana as a global leader in the energy marketplace. By injecting uncertainty and regulatory hurdles into this process, we stand to undo all the progress that state leaders have touted for months.

“We cannot yield our position to states like Texas that stand ready to capture these same opportunities. CCS represents a chance to strengthen Louisiana’s energy sector and make us the energy giant of the future we know we can be.

“LABI stands ready to work with the Landry administration and President Trump to ensure Louisiana secures our energy future, creating good-paying jobs and thriving local communities for generations to come. This shared vision can only be realized by building on our existing resources and embracing innovative technologies like carbon capture and sequestration, sending a clear message: Louisiana is open for business.”

Statement from the Louisiana Chemical Association.

“The Louisiana Chemical Association appreciates Governor Landry’s focus on public safety, environmental stewardship, and economic growth. We share his commitment to responsible industrial development and community engagement, and we value the Administration’s broader efforts to establish Louisiana as a premier place for business investments. To that end, our industry has already committed over $60 billion to projects that depend on carbon capture and storage.

That is why we are concerned that a conditional moratorium on new Class VI permit applications, as announced today, sends the wrong message to the market at a pivotal moment for Louisiana’s economy. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is a critical part of maintaining and growing the manufacturing industry in our state. A pause on applications, regardless of the reasoning, signals uncertainty for projects that enable lower-emissions production, support thousands of high-wage jobs, and encourage future reinvestment.

Louisiana earned federal approval to run its own Class VI program so that permitting could be rigorous, predictable, and efficient here at home. That hard-won primacy, and the state’s recent issuance of its first Class VI permit, demonstrate that Louisiana can safely develop these projects in a way that protects communities and natural resources while continuing to encourage industrial investment in the state. A moratorium undermines that predictability at the very time companies are making multi-billion-dollar, multi-decade siting decisions.

LCA remains committed to working with the Governor, state agencies, and local officials to address concerns and deliver the environmental and economic benefits made possible by CCS projects in the state. Louisiana should proudly lead the nation in safe, responsible industrial decarbonization rather than signaling hesitation that allows other states to seize this opportunity.”

Statement from the Louisiana Oil and Gas Association.

“We respectfully disagree with the Governor‘s decision to halt the review of any new CCUS applications.

“We are thankful that the Governor didn’t cancel existing CCUS projects, which will continue to prove how safe this technology actually is, and we encourage industry to continue moving forward with the hope that the Governor will lift this moratorium sooner rather than later.

“For 75+ years Louisiana’s regulatory arm has safely authorized and governed injection wells. AND for 40+ years through Enhanced Oil Recovery, the Department has safely regulated the injection of CO2. In fact, since 2010, over 47 billion metric tons of CO2 have been safely injected and ultimately stored in Louisiana formations.

“Carbon capture is a proven tool that will bring significant economic development and new opportunities to our state and our country, and we remain committed to advancing these benefits for Louisiana.”

Statement from American Petroleum Institute Gulf Coast Region Director Gifford Briggs.

“We share the governor’s goal of addressing the backlog of CCS project applications, but an indefinite moratorium undermines Louisiana’s energy leadership and sets a precedent that could discourage development and innovation across the Gulf Coast and the nation. This executive order creates uncertainty that could delay projects, and send jobs and opportunities elsewhere. Now, Louisiana’s leadership role in American energy security is in jeopardy.”

Residential solar installer Sunnova, the solar lender Solar Mosaic and the panel maker Meyer Burger have all filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection this year. Now, utility-scale solar developer Pine Gate Renewables, based in Asheville, North Carolina, plans to file for bankruptcy protection in early November, according to a person with knowledge of its business plans.

The financial woes mark the likely end of a green investment boom that emerged under former President Joe Biden, who signed generous tax credits for renewable development, but has become increasingly strained in recent years as interest rates rose and supply chains labored to keep up. Trump has piled on more pressure, phasing out Biden’s tax credits, trashing permits for planned developments and imposing tariffs on a wide range of imported components.

“You had the look of a bubble in 2019-2020 when everyone and their mother was a renewable energy developer,” said Patrick Worrall, the chief financial officer of New Columbia Solar and a longtime industry observer. The industry, he said, is now “in the process of seeing the beginning part of a depression.”

Pine Gate increasingly looks like a cautionary tale. Founded in 2016, it claims to have secured more than $7 billion in project financing and capital investment. It has more than 100 solar facilities operating across the country with a combined 2 gigawatts of capacity.

It was already under financial duress before Trump took office. Pine Gate executives were racing to raise money to stave off a cash crunch last year, and the company has been forced to pay for construction mistakes made by its subsidiary, Blue Ridge Power. The company notified North Carolina regulators last month it was planning to lay off more than 500 people at Blue Ridge Power, according to PV Magazine. A Pine Gate spokesperson did not respond to requests for comment.

Bloomberg was the first to report that the company was pondering a bankruptcy filing.

‘The climate imperative’

Demand for electricity is growing, and analysts say the long lead times needed to build traditional power plants that run on natural gas or nuclear energy mean wind, solar and batteries still have a place in the U.S. power mix. In the short term, business is booming as developers rush to get projects into construction before the clean energy tax credits disappear in July.

The outlook for the industry darkens after 2026. Several analysts said they expect a wave of consolidation and bankruptcies, as companies struggle to navigate the combination of tariffs, the loss of tax credits and lenders’ increasing hesitance to invest in early stage renewable projects.

Large investors including Generate Capital, the green investment fund that holds a stake in Pine Gate, are shifting their strategy by investing in projects rather than development companies. A Generate Capital spokesperson declined to comment, but the fund’s thinking was outlined in a recent blog post by CEO David Crane.

The industry needs to be “honest about our mistakes,” Crane wrote, arguing that the sector’s growth and climate aspirations clouded its business judgment.

“Our priority today is to invest in sound projects, sponsored and implemented by well-run companies focused on the fundamentals,” said Crane, a former utility executive who served in the Biden administration. “This is where the climate imperative rests right now.”

DOE blames Biden for staff cuts

The Department of Energy has accused at least six of its own offices of “wasteful spending” and told staffers they may be reassigned, fired or transferred, write Hannah Northey and Carlos Anchondo.

The agency has begun so-called reductions in force in the offices of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, Clean Energy Demonstrations, State and Community Energy Programs, and Minority Economic Impact. EERE contains three offices that focus on solar, wind and hydrogen.

“All these offices played a major role in the Biden administration’s war on American Energy,” said DOE spokesperson Ben Dietderich. The moves come after Trump on Tuesday said he would soon cut “Democrat programs” and warned “they’re never going to come back in many cases.”

Florida emergency managers oversee Alligator Alcatraz

The Florida detention center known as Alligator Alcatraz is being run by the state Division of Emergency Management, Thomas Frank writes.

Other emergency managers say they fear that could scare away immigrants and Hispanic citizens from seeking help after a natural disaster. “A detention center for immigrants is not something emergency managers should build,” said Sarah Miller, who formerly coordinated emergency management for 16 cities near Seattle.

It’s an unusual arrangement: The other four detention centers created by the Trump administration for immigration-related arrests operate at prisons or are run by the state departments of correction. But Florida emergency manager Kevin Guthrie has played a central role in the construction and operation of Alligator Alcatraz.

Florida DEM spokesperson Stephanie Hartman said of the criticism, “illegal immigration is a national emergency.”

Cut red tape and oppose Trump, Danish minister says

The Danish foreign minister believes the EU can deregulate without bowing to Trump, writes Camille Gijs.

Brussels has been torching swaths of environmental red tape for over a year, as it tries to restore industry competitiveness with U.S. and Chinese rivals. Next week, EU leaders are expected to urge the bloc’s executive to speed up the efforts, which now span the defense, environmental and digital sectors.

Danish Foreign Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen said the move is vital to keeping Europe globally competitive.

“If our investors are met with the red carpet in the U.S. and by red tape in Europe, they will, at the end of the day, choose the U.S.,” he stressed.

What their engineers found are two completely different approaches to cooling.

One prioritizes simplicity, while the other squeezes out efficiency using some surprising engineering.

Cooling an electric motor seems like a science that we've had down for years. Just throw some liquid antifreeze through some tubes, make sure air is blowing through a sufficiently sized radiator and everything is fine. But there's a fine science that goes into making sure each component is cooled to just the right amount and in the right places.

Recently, Sandy Munro's engineering firm, Munro & Associates, decided to tear down two electric traction motors. One is from a Tesla Cybertruck and the other is from a Chevrolet Equinox—meaning that we're getting a taste of Silicon Valley's latest and greatest, as well as Detroit's take on making an affordable electric powertrain. The differences show that the automakers have wildly different strategies for cooling their drive motors.

The technical explainer of the two motors is given by Munro's Paul Turnbull. He shows off the internals of both motors, as well as the various parts needed to cool them, and notes the trade-offs between the two platforms.

Let's start with GM's approach to cooling the motor. Turnbull explains that GM's brilliance is in the simplicity of how it achieves cooling—rather than use complex plumbing and pumps, GM uses the motor itself as kind of an ingenious gear system to fling oil upwards into cast channels that then use gravity to rain down over the motor. This cools the windings, magnets, and cast metal all at once.

This method is cheap to engineer and simple because there are fewer moving parts to fail. It also doesn't require sapping additional power from the car's battery to run any external cooling hardware (more on this in a moment with Tesla's approach). It's also an old trick that Toyota used more than a decade ago in the Prius C.

But this clever setup has limits. It's dependent on the motor speed, basically self-throttling oil when you're flying down the highway but not so much when the motor is stationary in traffic. And if you're on a steep hill or thrashing around a track, the system's ""rainfall"" method of cooling can shift off target, which might not be ideal for an electric motor that can spin at speed of around 10,000 RPM.

Tesla, on the other hand, uses a more precise method of cooling. It uses a high-pressure pump to force oil into channels where it flows over specific components like the electrical windings and magnets to keep them nice and cool. This approach to cooling is also why Tesla can use cheaper neodymium magnets in its powertrains rather than rare earth metals.

By not over-cooling the motor itself (but rather precisely applying the oil to the points where temperature matters the most), Tesla's approach means that the motor's casing stays at a higher temperature despite its cooler internals. This increases the electrical resistance of the case and reduces the formation of eddy currents.

Eddy currents, for those who don't know, are basically tiny whirlpools of electricity that occur as the magnetic fields from an EV motor changes while it spins. This isn't a problem unique to EVs at all, but we're talking about it today because EVs use magnets to power the drive motors. Every time the magnetic field flips within the motor as it turns, tiny loops of unwanted electricity are stirred up and bleed into the metal encasing components. These small fields create extra heat and waste energy—basically causing an efficiency problem that can be reduced by keeping the motor's casing warmer and naturally increasing its resistance to electricity.

The trade-off is that the pump eats energy from the battery just to keep things cool. But so does the physical resistance created using GM's method. It is a bit more complex, though, as extra machining is needed for the specific passages in Tesla's motor, plus extra parts, plumbing and the pump itself.

In short: GM is trusting physics while Tesla is trusting plumping. But in a roundabout way, the more complex way—Tesla's way—is more technologically groundbreaking. It allows the brand to cut costs inside of the motor thanks to some funky electrical wizardry and squeeze out every extra ounce of performance.

Both ways are smart, and both ways certainly work. If nothing else, it's proof that there are plenty of ways to go about achieving the same task in the EV world using wildly different methods. The question is: does the automaker prioritize efficiency or simplicity? That's what shapes the solution.",https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/lElz3g/s1/tesla-gm-electric-motor-comparison-hero.jpg,N,,2025-10-15 21:04:43.791703

“I put public lands and conservation in that category.” Public lands are, by definition, for everyone.
Public Lands as Common Ground Public lands in the U.S. have historically been contested terrain, according to Peterson.
Park-related ballot measures regularly pass with strong support from voters across the political spectrum as Americans of all political affiliations continue to use, appreciate and advocate for public lands.
But the broader issue of preserving public confidence in the organizations that oversee America’s public lands requires thoughtful consideration, according to Larson.","A recent complaint filed by an environmental advocacy group has drawn new attention to the intersection of politics, public lands and the agencies that manage them.

The complaint, brought by the Center for Biological Diversity, argues that a banner on the U.S. Forest Service website violates the Hatch Act, a 1939 law designed to prevent the use of taxpayer-funded resources for partisan political purposes.

As of October 15, 2025, the site includes a banner that reads, “The Radical Left Democrats shut down the government … President Trump has made it clear he wants to keep the government open and support those who feed, fuel, and clothe the American people.”

Whether the banner crosses a legal line remains unclear. Still, the case underscores a deeper concern: the potential erosion of political neutrality in federal land management agencies and the growing polarization of public lands and conservation efforts.

The U.S. Forest Service manages approximately 193 million acres of public land across the United States, including 154 national forests and 20 national grasslands across 43 states, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. Most of this land is open to the public for a wide range of recreational activities.

“There’s a reason the Hatch Act exists, and that’s to keep politics out of basic government functioning, particularly when discussing provision of essential services,” said Lincoln Larson, an associate professor of parks, recreation and tourism management at North Carolina State University. “I put public lands and conservation in that category.”

Public lands are, by definition, for everyone. And they offer countless benefits, including recreation, conservation of wildlife and natural resources, and support for local economies. The use of politicized language, especially when presented on official government platforms for these lands, could jeopardize the bipartisan support that has protected them for more than a century.

“If people think that parks or public lands are somehow partisan, they might be less likely to use or support them. In that case, everyone loses,” said Larson, who has conducted research on the political polarization of conservation issues.

That concern is particularly relevant today, when political identity is playing a greater role in shaping Americans’ views on a wide range of issues, from science to public health to environmental policy.

“Anytime you brand something with politics these days, it matters. In the past, people were able to hold multiple identities simultaneously. But today, our political identities seem to define pretty much everything,” Larson said.

Nils Peterson, a professor of forestry and environmental resources at NC State and one of Larson’s frequent collaborators, noted that while relatively few people may actually see messages on federal websites, the symbolism matters.

“If it becomes the norm for the political party controlling the executive branch to use federal agencies for campaigning, that might eventually encourage people to view federal agencies as partisan entities,” said Peterson, who studies public attitudes toward land management.

Public Lands as Common Ground

Public lands in the U.S. have historically been contested terrain, according to Peterson. From the Sagebrush Rebellion of the 1970s to more recent debates over energy development and land use, federal lands have often reflected deeper ideological divides.

“Fights over federal lands and land management agencies go all the way back to their origins,” Peterson said.

Conflicts usually stem from differing priorities, such as whether to allow grazing and mining activities or to protect the land for recreation and conservation, underscoring the difficulty of reconciling local needs with federal management.

Yet despite this contentious history, public lands have also emerged as one of the few policy areas to garner broad bipartisan support. In recent decades, conservation and public lands have often served as unifying issues. As Larson noted, they have acted as “a bridge, not a wedge” across political divides.

The data supports this view, according to Larson. Park-related ballot measures regularly pass with strong support from voters across the political spectrum as Americans of all political affiliations continue to use, appreciate and advocate for public lands.

But as Larson noted, that unity is fragile as political polarization threatens to turn even widely shared values into partisan battlegrounds, raising concerns not only about the sustainability of public lands but also about the neutrality of federal agencies tasked with managing them.

Hope Rises from Shared Responsibility

The outcome of the Hatch Act complaint will be decided by legal experts. But the broader issue of preserving public confidence in the organizations that oversee America’s public lands requires thoughtful consideration, according to Larson.

Growing political polarization around public lands, and the looming threat of privatization, carries consequences that are far from symbolic, potentially influencing everything from funding priorities and conservation policies to how Americans across the political spectrum experience and value these spaces.

Larson emphasized that national parks and other public lands require the dedication and support of all Americans to confront increasing challenges, including deteriorating infrastructure, insufficient staffing, climate change impacts and unprecedented levels of visitation.

“I still firmly believe that public lands can serve as a common ground.”

Sustained public engagement and investment, both in terms of advocacy and financial support, are essential to overcoming these challenges. Without widespread support, the ability to maintain and protect public lands will be significantly limited.

“Ensuring the long-term health of these shared spaces requires not just policy action, but a sustained, nationwide commitment to their stewardship,” Larson said.

As debates over budgets, shutdowns and political messaging continue, Larson reiterated that conservation has the potential to unite more than it divides. “I still firmly believe that public lands can serve as a common ground, offering a unique opportunity to bring people together, improve our quality of life, and inspire a shared sense of responsibility to protect and enjoy America’s natural and cultural treasures.”",https://cnr.ncsu.edu/news/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2025/10/mount-baker-snoqualmie-national-forest-zoshua-colah-unsplash-1146x600-1.jpeg,N,,2025-10-15 18:13:52.480703

Soon, that number will dwindle just a little, thanks to a $125 million grant from the Michigan Department of Education (MDE).

Districts across the state will receive 10 propane and 87 electric buses, which will replace older diesel-powered buses in 23 school districts.

The program is a partnership between the MDE, the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy (EGLE). It’s received support from environmental advocacy groups like It’s Electric! and Michigan Association of Pupil Transportation (MAPT).

A third round investment of the Clean Bus Energy Grant, totaling $35.9 million, paid for the 100 additional buses.

The Environmental Protection Agency provided states with $5 billion over five years to create the Clean School Bus Program. Michigan’s program was “created after that to kind of help fill the gaps that we felt the federal program was missing,” Kindra Weid, the Coalition Coordinator of It’s Electric, said.

Public schools could apply for the grant. A primary goal of increasing the number of cleaner-powered buses was to reduce diesel emissions, which are a detriment to air quality. EGLE found which areas of the state were most polluted through mapping tool MI EJScreen, Troy Hansbarger, MDE's Manager of Office of Health Safety, said.

“Our goal was to really target those areas so that we can remove a lot of those diesel buses and replace those with cleaner emission vehicles.”

Asthma is a leading cause of absenteeism, according to the state health department. Each year, as a result of asthma, about 1 in 8 Michigan students miss more than six days of school. Diesel exhaust is a common trigger of asthma.

“And so, that's like a big driver for why we want cleaner buses,” Weid said. “Some kids throughout rural Michigan are on the bus for a very long time, and that means that their exposure to diesel exhaust is extensive on the drive in and the drive home.”

Katrina Morris, the executive director of MAPT, is from West Shore Educational Service District in Northwest Michigan. She transports about 130 students across distances the size of Delaware. She hopes the cleaner-powered buses will yield quieter rides, which provide a better environment for students susceptible to sound issues.

“We carry a lot of severely, multiply impaired children that have severe needs, medical needs,” Morris said. “And so this will help them to be able to have that safer ride, which is what we are all here for.”

Already, though, the program has faced challenges at the federal level. Districts relying on federal funding were “left in the dark,” Hansbarger said.

They didn't know when those funds were to be released, so they didn't know how much they had available to them. So, they didn't know how much they needed from Michigan to complete their projects.

Other districts had chosen a bus company, like Lion Electric, that stopped servicing the U.S.

Not all the cleaner-powered buses have been purchased or entered into service yet. The grant will provide a final $44 million round of investment.

“It can’t be subsidized by the US taxpayer — the president has been 100% clear on that. And we don’t want it reliant on foreign sources like China,” Agen, executive director of the White House National Energy Dominance Council, said at Semafor’s World Economy Summit on Wednesday. “If you have American companies, and you’re not reliant on US taxpayers, that’s the hurdle to get over.”

Many components of renewable energy technologies are manufactured outside the US, and some in China. Wind and solar are among the cheapest and fastest ways to add capacity to the grid in many regions, but those suppliers are running up against policy shifts that favor baseload power like fossil fuels and nuclear. The White House has placed greater emphasis on mining operations and piping infrastructure to move fossil fuels more efficiently across the country. In recent months, Trump has reduced federal subsidies for clean energy, imposed tighter requirements, and fast-tracked fossil fuel projects.

Trump is checking gasoline and power prices every day, Agen said, adding that the administration is working to speed the production of fossil fuel projects to compete with solar and wind power, which are often easier to build. “That’s why we’ve changed permitting. That’s why we’ve changed some of the way we’re looking at funding,” he said.

Clint Woods spoke at a recent hearing about the Clean Air Act at the U.S. House Committee on Energy and Commerce.

The last major update to the Clean Air Act was 35 years ago. Though rules that come out of the act are updated more frequently — like the National Ambient Air Quality Standards, which are updated about every five years.

On the new limits for soot

Woods said the federal government should repeal the Biden administration’s standard for soot — pollution that can harm your heart and lungs that often comes from things like cars, factories and coal plants.

The Environmental Protection Agency under former President Joe Biden lowered the amount of soot allowed from 12 micrograms per cubic meter to 9 micrograms. Woods said while most of Indiana is expected to meet the stricter standard, it's doesn't leave much ""headroom.""

“It really limits the ability of new investment to come in — whether that's a data center new energy generation opportunity for advanced manufacturing. And so, that really is a limiting factor in a state like ours,"" Woods said.

Woods called the standard “legally and scientifically dubious” but didn’t explain why. Like most EPA rules, industry had the opportunity to weigh-in on the new soot standard.

Janet McCabe served as the deputy EPA administrator under Biden. She is a visiting professor with the Indiana University McKinney School of Law and affiliated with IU's Environmental Resilience Institute.

She said the National Ambient Air Quality Standards — like the one for soot — are one of the biggest decisions that the EPA takes on.

""It is highly documented and supported. And I actually think that of all the pollutants out there, there is the most agreement around particulate matter,"" McCabe said. ""The science shows that there is no threshold below which it is safe to breathe in particulate matter. The risk gets less and less as you get lower and lower. But the in terms of lives saved and health improved, when you lower that standard, you are protecting public health. So I really would wonder about statements that question the how well that decision was supported.""

The new standard is expected to save thousands of lives in the U.S. every year — including in Indiana's metro areas.

On EPA's review of state decisions

Woods said the EPA often “second-guesses” Indiana’s decisions — like its plans for implementing federal air quality standards and the permits it grants for facilities that pollute. He said this causes delays, threatening the state’s ability to compete for business.

""[EPA's review process sometimes] expands issues that are not within that key provision of the act and that narrowing that review process would go a long way to ensure that you don't have delays in key projects and that state-led delegated programs that work effectively in providing environmentally protective and legally durable permits could move much more quickly,"" Woods said.

McCabe said when permit reviews take a while, it's often because there are complicated issues at play. She said it’s the agency’s job to make sure things like permitting are done properly and consistently across the country.

""This is a partnership and EPA should not be micromanaging states — but does have a legitimate role to play,"" she said. ""Especially when members of the public have brought questions to EPA about either whether things are properly explained, whether input from the community has been responded to and and whether decisions are adequately explained and documented.""

On wildfire smoke and pollution that crosses state lines

Woods said the Clean Air Act also needs to do more to ensure that states like Indiana aren’t penalized for pollution that’s out of its control — like wildfire smoke from Canada or ozone pollution that may have drifted from Chicago.

""A week or two of catastrophic wildfire in California emits more greenhouse gasses an entire year of all energy-related activity in Indiana. So those things are incredibly impactful,"" Woods said.

He said environmental regulators now have a better ability to understand where pollution is coming from than what they did 35 years ago — and those tools need to be updated.

McCabe said while states shouldn't be held responsible for pollution they can't control, it’s important for the EPA to make sure wildfires are, in fact, the cause of that excess pollution.

""We're having more and more of these [wildfires]. If you have a couple a year, then it's not so hard. If you have dozens and dozens and dozens a year, then it they can build up and become a backlog and take a long time. And and so it's not crazy to say, let's look at that process and make sure it's as efficient as possible,"" she said.

McCabe said the issue of pollution crossing state lines into Indiana is nothing new. It's part of the reason why the Lake Michigan Air Directors Consortium exists — to help understand what causes air pollution in the region and discuss solutions.

""But you also need to pay attention to what the people who live in your state are exposed to day to day, and do your best to protect them from even more air pollution,"" she said.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/094a409/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2744x1441+0+0/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fa3%2Fde%2Fec30ae1947229eff67058875407b%2Fclintwoods2.PNG,N,,2025-10-15 21:05:45.647469

“Trump’s latest firings and the gutting of initiatives that lower energy costs for families add insult to injury. The American people will pay the price with higher utility bills.

“At a time when Floridians and families across the country are demanding affordable, reliable energy – and grappling with a health care crisis - these reckless attacks on clean energy initiatives make our nation less competitive and more dependent on foreign energy. I will continue fighting in Congress for clean energy jobs and lower costs for working families.”",https://castor.house.gov/images/facebook-meta.jpg,N,,2025-10-15 18:11:21.949816

Marine energy and the American Energy Dominance plan The American Energy Dominance plan provides federal support for energy resources that can deliver electricity on a reliable 24/7 basis — regardless of seasonal changes, weather conditions or time of day.

Signs of life for marine power at the U.S. Department of Energy As may be expected, the Marine Energy Program has not publicized any new projects in 2025, but the agency did expand a longstanding agreement with Norway to include marine energy.","Federal energy policy has taken a sharp U-turn under the American Energy Dominance plan set out by U.S. President Donald Trump earlier this year. But the new policy actually supports several forms of renewable energy, including biomass, hydropower and geothermal. In an interesting development, marine energy sourced from the movement of oceans and rivers also meets the plan’s 24/7 deliverability standard, and recent moves open the door for a plentiful new source of clean electricity for coastal communities and ocean-based industries.

Marine energy and the American Energy Dominance plan

The American Energy Dominance plan provides federal support for energy resources that can deliver electricity on a reliable 24/7 basis — regardless of seasonal changes, weather conditions or time of day. That standard includes coal, oil and natural gas along with nuclear energy. It excludes wind and solar energy, declining to recognize that modern energy storage and grid management systems can cover those gaps in wind and solar availability.

In contrast, biomass, hydropower and geothermal power plants can operate on a 24/7 basis, meeting the same standard that applies to fossil fuels and nuclear energy. The January 20 presidential Executive Order titled “Unleashing American Energy” lists biomass and hydropower among the resources to be supported. In February, Energy Secretary Chris Wright followed up with another order, titled “Unleashing the Golden Age of American Energy Dominance,” which also mentioned hydropower along with geothermal.

Neither document refers directly to marine power sourced from devices that transfer the kinetic energy of waves, tides and currents into electricity. But it meets the 24/7 standard, and the Department of Energy continues host an online footprint for its Marine Energy Program.

“The power coursing through oceans and rivers equates to nearly 60 percent of the United States’ total electricity needs,” the Energy Department’s program webpage reads reads, referring to resources that are technically available, but not necessarily recoverable.

Shipping, fishing and other existing uses are among the factors that can limit the amount of marine energy that is actually recoverable. Even so, marine energy has potential to play a key role in the U.S. energy profile. “Even if only a small portion of the energy from these waterways is harvested, marine energy could still make significant contributions to the nation’s energy needs and provide millions of Americans with locally-sourced, reliable and affordable energy,” according to the Energy Department.

Signs of life for marine power at the U.S. Department of Energy

As may be expected, the Marine Energy Program has not publicized any new projects in 2025, but the agency did expand a longstanding agreement with Norway to include marine energy.

The department has worked with Norway’s Royal Ministry of Energy on hydropower since 2004. By combining the work of U.S. national laboratories and Norway’s SINTEF Energy Research, the partners developed new ways to modernize and improve the efficiency of hydropower systems, which use dams to generate power from rivers. In an updated agreedment signed in July, they’re now setting their sights on deploying marine energy systems to harness the natural movement of oceans and other water sources. “We are building upon our two nations’ shared expertise and advanced marine energy technologies to support President Trump’s pro-growth energy agenda for the American people,” Energy Secretary Wright emphasized.

A newly purchased 3D printer may also help a key U.S. research lab, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), to fine-tune more marine energy devices. Developed by the Tennessee startup One-Off Robotics, the new laser-powered metal 3D-printing system can create specialty parts capable of withstanding the merciless force of ocean currents — creating new pathways for NREL research into marine power.

Instead of waiting for up to nine months for a single part to arrive from a remote factory, research teams at the lab can now fabricate their own parts, on site, in a matter of days. “We have a good amount of experience doing rapid prototyping and additive manufacturing with smaller machines,” said Casey Nichols, an NREL research engineer focused on novel marine energy technologies, in a statement. “But getting a larger 3D printer lets us do more at-scale research.”

The new resource will allow researchers to perform real-life testing on full-scale prototypes more rapidly and economically, and help them to assess how 3D printing can reduce the cost of manufacturing marine energy devices for the commercial market, Nichols said.

Developers are moving forward with marine energy in the U.S., with or without federal support

While the U.S. Department of Energy could opt to push ahead or pull back from funding new marine energy development programs, developers and researchers continue to show potential for growth in the U.S. market. In 2023, for example, the Israeli startup EcoWave Power committed to a install a pilot-scale version of its new wave energy harvesting system at the Port of Los Angeles in California, with 50 percent of the funding provided by Shell through its Marine Energy Program.

Switched on earlier this year, the system consists of a row of bright blue floaters fixed to a jetty that bob up and down with every wave, creating hydraulic pressure which drives a generator to produce electricity. It’s meant to serves as a demonstration and educational platform to show what wave power can do. “We know there’s incredible potential for wave energy to power our communities and protect our environment,” U.S. Rep. Nanette Barragán said on a recent visit to the Eco Wave installation. Barragán represents the communities around the Port of Los Angeles and last week introduced the $1 billion Marine Energy Technologies Acceleration Act to channel more federal support to the fledgling industry.",https://triplepundit.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/cropped-3P-Icon-32x32.png,N,,2025-10-15 18:11:34.778760

China’s investments in South American energy infrastructure encompass two distinct sectors: energy generation and energy distribution.
China’s initial investments in South America stressed the generation aspect, focused on megaprojects billed as dramatically boosting host countries’ energy supply.
Energy infrastructure, along with ports, railways, and telecommunications, all constitute elements of this physical sanctions network.
To begin, the United States should seek to boost the ability of South American regulators to spot and prevent problematic investments in their energy infrastructure.","In Lima, Peru, electricity to the city of 10 million is controlled by just two companies, China Southern Power Grid International (CSGI) and China Three Gorges Corporation. Both are state-owned enterprises based in the People’s Republic of China (PRC). Together, these firms account for 54 percent and 46 percent of the electricity distribution to a city that is home to roughly one-third of the population of Peru. Even setting aside geopolitical considerations, such a degree of market concentration would normally turn heads; the fact that this structure provides a direct line to a foreign government should be cause for further alarm.

Peru is not alone in this story. In neighboring Chile, Chinese companies account for roughly two-thirds of power distribution, while in Brazil, China has poured billions into electricity transmission projects. These investments curtail strategic autonomy and shape the options available to countries for housing and industrial policy, and, in a worst-case scenario, could be actively weaponized by the PRC.

However, China’s growing presence in South American energy generation and distribution has largely gone underreported, even as it risks placing critical infrastructure under foreign influence. Properly grasping the nature of this influence is of particular importance as the United States finds itself in the midst of a shift to a more competitive stance in its foreign policy approach in the Western Hemisphere.

Under the Trump administration, Washington appears increasingly willing to ask countries to choose between the United States and the PRC. From ports along the Panama Canal to space observatories in the Atacama, infrastructure projects subject to Chinese influence are facing drastically heightened pressure. In a world of more sharp-elbowed foreign policy, control over critical infrastructure—or the generation capacity to power it—gives China influence that trade relationships and diplomatic ties cannot buy. As the United States amps up its efforts to displace China from key infrastructure in the region, it seems increasingly likely that China will fall back to its power position in regional energy projects as a backstop.

Energy: A Win-Win Collaboration?

South America has all the tools at its disposal to become a global energy leader, and a remarkably green one at that. While the continent is home to vast reserves of oil and natural gas, it also possesses lithium to build batteries and solar cells, and powerful rivers to generate hydropower. The region has even experimented with more emerging technologies like geothermal power in a bid to further diversify energy sources.

However, recent events have shown that this energy potential has yet to be realized or otherwise rests on unsteady foundations. In February 2025, Chile was roiled by country-wide blackouts that left millions without power and led to widespread disruptions in the country’s crucial mining and industrial sectors as well. Reliance on hydropower in countries like Ecuador and Brazil has helped make grids less carbon-intensive, but also increases vulnerability to climate change–induced droughts, which sap the rivers needed to power hydroelectric dams and create tension with local communities who rely on the same sources for drinking water and irrigation.

For this reason, South American governments have been eager to cultivate international partnerships to better develop their energy resources and increase the reliability of their electrical grids. Both are areas where the PRC has eagerly entered the fray.

China’s investments in South American energy infrastructure encompass two distinct sectors: energy generation and energy distribution. The first of these concerns power plants and generators that produce energy, typically by burning fossil fuels or else through hydroelectric dams, wind, or solar farms. Distribution involves sending the energy produced from these power plants first to substations closer to population centers via transmission lines, and then eventually to individual households, businesses, or factories.

China’s initial investments in South America stressed the generation aspect, focused on megaprojects billed as dramatically boosting host countries’ energy supply. China’s own massive power buildout and success with megaprojects like the Three Gorges Dam meant PRC-based firms brought extensive technical expertise to the table, typically at far lower costs than U.S. or European competitors. These initiatives nevertheless left a checkered history, saddling recipients with unsustainable levels of debt and leaving behind a string of allegations of environmental malpractice.

Power Corrupts

Ecuador is particularly illustrative of the way courting the PRC for energy investment can undermine national sovereignty and crimp strategic autonomy. Beginning in 2009, then-President Rafael Correa agreed to a $1 billion loan from China to be secured against Ecuador’s oil industry. This loan would be the first of many that Correa would sign, leveraging China’s demand for oil in exchange for development financing. Indeed, just one year later, Ecuador would take out another $1.7 billion from the China Import-Export Bank to help finance the construction of the Coca Codo Sinclair hydroelectric dam. Intended to be a legacy-defining project for Correa and deliver massive returns to the Ecuadorian economy in the form of cheap, plentiful, clean energy, the project has turned into a boondoggle and symbol of failed PRC megaprojects in the region.

Even at the time of its construction, concerns about the dam were widespread. Independent reviews by experts cited inconsistent water levels, meaning that the advertised 1,500 megawatts of installed generation capacity could only be achieved under certain conditions. The dam’s location, near the active Reventador volcano, meant it would come under significant geological stress, which could potentially trigger a collapse of the structure if poorly designed. Since coming online in 2016, the dam has vindicated these criticisms and more. It has operated at closer to 59 percent of capacity since an initial full-power test compromised Ecuador’s electrical grid. Shoddy construction coupled with geological activity has led to more than 17,000 cracks in the dam being reported, leading experts to deem the facility a “time bomb.” Finally, the $3 billion final price tag of the project, and $19 billion in total loans taken from China under the Correa government, have saddled Ecuador with an unsustainable debt burden and birthed still-simmering corruption scandals.

Despite the sordid history of Ecuador’s engagement with China, Beijing’s influence over the South American country persists. Since Correa, three successive governments have continued to sell oil at discounted rates to the PRC as part of the country’s debt service. According to a 2022 report from the National Assembly, this arrangement caused Ecuador to forgo some $5 billion in oil revenues had it been able to sell at market prices instead. Meanwhile, Chinese oil companies Sinopec and China National Petroleum Corporation obtained licenses to drill on Ecuadorian territory in 2021 and 2022, respectively. Most recently, the government of President Daniel Noboa announced it had reached an agreement with state-owned electricity company PowerChina to assume control of operations at Coca Codo Sinclair. As part of the deal, PowerChina would invest an additional $400 million in Ecuador’s energy sector, focused on renewable power generation and storage.

In Peru as well, China Three Gorges has acquired a dominant position in both the generation and transmission sectors, with potentially harmful consequences for consumers in the country. In 2018, it purchased the Chaglla hydroelectric dam from embattled Brazilian company Odebrecht. Then, in 2020, it took a majority stake in Luz del Sur, an electrical utility responsible for the majority of power distribution to Lima. Peruvian regulators and civil society at the time feared this concentration could prejudice competition, allowing China Three Gorges to essentially buy power from itself, letting it manipulate rates at will. Accordingly, Luz del Sur was prohibited from buying power from generators owned by China Three Gorges without a bidding process. When CSGI acquired Italian electrical utility Enel’s infrastructure in Peru in 2023, a similar stipulation was imposed. However, according to one analysis, these provisions may merely forestall the inevitable, as they will expire in 2030, at which point, both China Three Gorges and CSGI will be well-positioned to squeeze remaining competitors out of the Peruvian market.

The PRC’s increasing investments in transmission infrastructure could also pave the way for further dominance of South America’s digital domain. China is a major supplier of smart meters, providing some 600,000 meters to Uruguay in 2021. This technology is vital for the region, where power loss, energy that is generated but never makes it to the consumer, is as high as 15 percent. Smart meters can prevent power loss by monitoring electricity use in real time and relaying that information back to distributors who can reroute power to correct inefficiencies. But smart meters also create new cybersecurity vulnerabilities, particularly when, as in the case of Uruguay, they are connected to and routed through national telecommunications networks. Petty criminals already hack smart meters to dodge fees, and Russia-linked hackers have targeted power grids in Ukraine and Lithuania with cyberattacks, underscoring the importance of shoring up digital defenses for this critical infrastructure. Research from Oregon State University has further shown how a cyberattack could exploit smart meters themselves to simulate oscillations in the grid, causing power shut-offs. These risks are further magnified when the malicious actor is not a criminal group, but rather the supplier of the meters, who could have access to zero-day vulnerabilities.

Reenergizing Competition

Whether along the Panama Canal or Mexican car imports, the United States is increasingly applying pressure against Latin American governments to minimize their ties to China and has shown itself willing to use hard power threats and tariffs to do so. While China is working diligently to minimize its own exposure to U.S. economic sanctions, it also appears to be seeking to build its own system of physical infrastructure sanctions. Energy infrastructure, along with ports, railways, and telecommunications, all constitute elements of this physical sanctions network. Countries that have come to depend on Chinese companies to move goods, illuminate their cities, and provide internet to their people will likely be loath to turn against the PRC for fear of losing its support in these essential functions.

While the PRC is already well-entrenched in South America’s energy sector, it is not immovably so. More canny commercial diplomacy and capacity-building could go a long way to defang China’s infrastructure dominance strategy in the Americas. In doing so, the United States, alongside partner governments, should strive to employ “insulation” strategies, not seeking to extirpate Chinese influence entirely, but rather to minimize the potential that the PRC could leverage its position to coerce governments.

To begin, the United States should seek to boost the ability of South American regulators to spot and prevent problematic investments in their energy infrastructure. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) serves to review foreign investments in the United States and ensure these do not leave a potential malign actor in control of critical infrastructure. No South American government possesses an equivalent to CFIUS, and while many countries have regulatory bodies that exist to prevent harmful concentration in a given sector, these entities often lack the tools to identify and respond to China’s opaque business practices. The United States should consider connecting CFIUS representatives to countries in the region to highlight best practices and help countries stand up their own equivalents, either as independent agencies or constituent bodies of regulators. All of this can be done in the name of bolstering national sovereignty and preserving strategic autonomy—goals that should strongly resonate with Latin American countries as great power competition increases.

The United States can also employ “competition” strategies aimed at encouraging U.S. and allied power companies to return to South America. While China has gained ground in recent years, Western companies like Sempra, Bechtel, and Enel all have a current or recent history in the region and remain globally competitive players. Brazil may be a promising first step in this regard, as the country is currently facing challenges integrating new wind and solar projects into its grid. These energy sources have high intermittency, meaning they fluctuate significantly over the course of the day in terms of how much power is produced, and are difficult to integrate into legacy transmission infrastructure. Recent reports have found that some Brazilian states, like Bahia, may need to intentionally reduce solar and wind production by as much as 30 percent below full capacity to keep the grid stable. While China dominates in selling wind and solar equipment, the United States has a qualitative management in the kinds of advanced grid technologies and data management platforms Brazil needs to effectively modernize its energy supply. The Department of Commerce, in partnership with U.S. embassies in the region, can identify upcoming tenders for strategic energy projects and bring delegations of U.S. companies to encourage them to bid on these.

Finally, financial institutions, especially the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC), Export-Import Bank, and Inter-American Development Bank, can play an enabling role in supporting U.S. bids for energy generation and transmission infrastructure. Particularly as the DFC heads towards reauthorization in the U.S. Congress, bolstering its authorities to work in South America should be a priority for any America-first development strategy.

WASHINGTON — A federal judge issued a temporary restraining order Wednesday, blocking the Trump administration from moving forward with the thousands of layoffs it initiated after the government shutdown began Oct. 1, as well as any others that officials might want to carry out.

The hearing in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California took place at the same time White House budget director Russ Vought appeared on the conservative Charlie Kirk podcast to preview his next steps.

Vought warned the initial Reductions in Force, the technical term for a layoff notice, were just “a snapshot” and that as many as 10,000 federal workers would lose their jobs if the shutdown drags on.

“We’re going to keep those RIFs rolling throughout this shutdown because we think it’s important to stay on offense for the American taxpayer and the American people,” Vought said. “We want to be very aggressive where we can be in shuttering the bureaucracy, not just the funding, but the bureaucracy.”

Judge Susan Illston said during the hearing that she granted the temporary restraining order because Trump administration officials had “taken advantage of the lapse in government spending, government functioning to assume that all bets are off, that the laws don’t apply to them anymore and that they can impose the structures that they like on the government situation that they don’t like.”

Illston said laws and regulations still apply during a shutdown and that, by all appearances, the Trump administration's actions in the case are politically motivated.

“Things are being done before they’re thought through — very much ready, fire, aim,” Illston said.

The ruling will put the approximately 4,000 layoffs noticed during the shutdown on hold as the court case proceeds.

DOJ unprepared to speak on merits of case

Elizabeth Hedges, a Justice Department attorney arguing the case on behalf of the Trump administration, said several times during the brief hearing she wasn’t prepared to speak about the merits of the case — a position that confounded the judge, who gave Hedges several chances to reverse course.

“We may be able to address the merits at the next stage,” Hedges said, after telling Illston she would need to check with others before making any statements about why the administration believes its actions are legal.

Danielle Leonard, an attorney representing the labor unions that brought the lawsuit, urged the judge to grant a temporary restraining order for all the departments and agencies that make up the executive branch, not just those that have announced RIFs.

Leonard said she believes Trump administration officials have decided how many additional federal employees to lay off during the shutdown, but have opted not to share that information with the court.

“The decision has been made, it's just a question of implementation and timing,” Leonard said, around the same time Vought was giving his podcast interview.

Illston, who was nominated by former President Bill Clinton, said at the end of the hearing she expected the attorneys to find a day in the coming weeks when they can attend a hearing on the next stage, which would be a preliminary injunction.

Senate deadlocks for ninth time

On the other side of the country, Republicans and Democrats continued to spar on Capitol Hill over the reasons for the shutdown, as the Senate failed for a ninth time to advance a short-term government spending bill.

The 51-44 vote was nearly identical to the others that have taken place since mid-September, and neither side appeared inclined to make concessions or even try to negotiate.

Nevada Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto and Pennsylvania Sen. John Fetterman, both Democrats, and Maine independent Sen. Angus King voted with Republicans to advance the bill. Kentucky GOP Sen. Rand Paul voted no.

Democrats maintain there must be a bipartisan deal to extend the enhanced tax credits that are set to expire at the end of this year for people who get their health insurance from the Affordable Care Act Marketplace.

GOP leaders said they are willing to begin negotiations on that issue, but only after Democrats vote to advance the stopgap bill that would fund government through Nov. 21.

The House voted mostly along party lines to approve the legislation in mid-September, but it has remained stalled in the Senate ever since, unable to garner the 60 votes needed to advance toward final passage. Republicans control the chamber with 53 seats.

Congress needs to approve the stopgap bill since it, once again, failed to approve all 12 of the full-year government funding bills by the Oct. 1 start of the new fiscal year.

The only other way to end the funding lapse would be for both chambers to reach a broadly bipartisan consensus on all of those appropriations bills.

Layoffs across agencies

The layoffs initiated by the Trump administration during the shutdown were detailed further on Tuesday in court filings from the labor unions’ attorneys as well as Trump administration officials.

Stephen Billy, senior adviser at the Office of Management and Budget, wrote the number of layoff notices had changed since Friday when he outlined the Reductions in Force to the court.

The numbers have fluctuated significantly for some departments, but not for all.

Commerce: Approximately 600 employees, up from 315

Education: Remained at 466 employees

Health and Human Services: 982 employees, down from a range of 1,100 to 1,200

Housing and Urban Development: Stayed at 442 employees

Homeland Security: Decreased to 54 from 176 employees

Treasury: Reduced somewhat to 1,377 employees, from 1,446

Energy, EPA layoffs

Federal workers at those departments have 60 days between when the notice was sent and when they will no longer have jobs, though a different standard is in place at the Energy Department and the Environmental Protection Agency.

Energy officials, the document says, “issued a general RIF notice informing 179 employees that they may receive a specific notice in the future if it is determined they will be part of any RIF. If so, that notice would provide the relevant notice period.”

But a spokesperson for the Energy Department emailed States Newsroom on Tuesday evening to confirm officials had issued RIF notices to workers in the Offices of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, Clean Energy Demonstrations, State and Community Energy Programs and Minority Economic Impact.

“All these offices played a major role in the Biden administration’s war on American Energy,” the spokesperson wrote. “They oversaw billions of dollars in wasteful spending and massive regulatory overreach, resulting in more expensive and less reliable energy. These offices are being realigned to reflect the Trump administration’s commitment to advancing affordable, reliable, and secure energy for the American people and a more responsible stewardship of taxpayer dollars.”

Further confusing the situation at the Energy Department, a footnote in the court document filed by Billy said that particular agency isn’t actually experiencing a lapse in funding.

The Billy court document said EPA officials sent 28 employees “intent to RIF” notices and will send formal RIF notices “to any affected employees at least 60 days prior to the effective date.”

A separate document, filed by Thomas J. Nagy Jr., deputy assistant secretary for Human Resources at HHS, said “data discrepancies and processing errors” led to 1,760 employees receiving layoff notices instead of the intended 982.

“Employees have been working since October 10, 2025, to rescind the notices that had been issued in error,” Nagy wrote.

At CDC, 'eliminating entire offices'

Yolanda Jacobs, president of the American Federation of Government Employees Local 2883, wrote in a brief to the court that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention “issued RIF notices to approximately 1,300 employees, eliminating entire offices at the agency. Then, within 24 hours, the CDC rescinded approximately 700 of those RIF notices.”

Jacobs wrote the 600 CDC workers who received RIFs will officially lose their jobs on Dec. 8, even though they have already lost access to work email and computers.

“Many Union members have told me that they are experiencing serious mental health problems and have found it very difficult to get their work done, given all of the turmoil that they have experienced this year,” Jacobs wrote, referencing previous RIF notices and reinstatements. “Members have told me that they worry on a day-to-day basis about whether they will have a job the next day. They said that they have felt like the Trump Administration has been using them as bargaining chips this year.”

Jacobs wrote that the Trump administration has decided to lay off many human resources workers, which had blocked other workers who received RIFs from being able to get information about how to roll over their health insurance coverage.

During past RIFs, she wrote, workers had “access to the employment records, including paystubs and performance records, that they need for processing their separations,” but cannot since they are locked out of computer systems.

Layoffs hit Department of Education

Rachel Gittleman, president of AFGE Local 252, which represents nearly 3,000 Education Department workers, wrote in a separate filing the layoffs will impact numerous programs, including civil rights, communications and outreach, elementary and secondary education, post secondary education, and special education and rehabilitative services.

“Receiving RIF notices has caused many employees enormous stress. A father of two young boys contacted me—he just moved into a new home and relies on his job to support his family,” Gittleman wrote. “He told me (he) doesn’t know what he will do next.”

Workers on maternity or disability leave also received layoff notices, “forcing them to job-hunt and face financial insecurity while managing newborns or health conditions,” she wrote.

Following past RIF notices, the department provided “career transitioning and counseling, benefits and retirement training, and access to other human resources and employee assistance programs.” But Gittleman wrote that isn’t happening this time.

‘Devastated’ HUD employees

Ashaki Robinson, regional vice president for AFGE Council 222, which represents nearly 5,000 HUD workers, said the layoff notices for that department will impact employees in Florida, Georgia, Kansas, Massachusetts, Puerto Rico, Texas and Washington, D.C., who manage a variety of programs.

“They are devastated that the RIF is happening and are very concerned about losing their incomes, health insurance coverage for themselves and dependents, and other employment benefits in 60 days, when they will be separated from employment,” Robinson wrote.

“The administration’s unwillingness to negotiate but rather prepare to use the shutdown as an opportunity to fire more federal workers and permanently destroy programs focused on protecting American families continues to demonstrate the cruelty with which Trump governs,” said Quentin Scott, federal policy director for the Chesapeake Climate Action Network (CCAN) Action Fund.

On Oct. 10, a court filing from the United States Office of Management and Budget stated that more than 4,000 federal workers across seven agencies received Reductions in Force (RIF) notices. Approximately 187 employees from the Department of Energy (DOE) received layoff notices, and 20 to 30 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) employees were told they could possibly receive an RIF in the future.

According to the National Park Service’s (NPS) contingency plan, published ahead of the shutdown, approximately 9,296 of the agency’s 14,500 employees were expected to be furloughed. Because of this, more than 35 former park superintendents sent a letter to the Trump administration, urging the parks be closed in the event of a shutdown.

The previous 2018 impasse left the NPS without sufficient personnel to take care of and protect the parks, meaning many landscapes suffered vandalism and destruction.

Theresa Pierno, president and CEO of the National Parks Conservation Association (NPCA), described leaving park gates open to the public during the shutdown as both irresponsible and dangerous.

“Our national parks have never been more at risk,” Pierno said in a statement. “Congress must immediately fund the government, fully support the Park Service and its staff, and stop any more devastating cuts, before it’s too late.”

Clean Energy Innovation at Risk

On Oct. 2, the day after the shutdown began, DOE announced that 321 financial awards supporting 223 projects could face termination. The discontinued awards were supplied by branches that championed innovative energy technologies, such as the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations (OCED), Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Grid Deployment Office(GDO) and others.

Maryland is one of the many states affected by these funding cuts, as 12 projects costing almost $88 million will be canceled. According to a list published by the Democratic members of the House Appropriations Committee’s, some of the terminated award recipients in Maryland include: the Power 52 Foundation, which offers employment in the solar industry and other green job industries to underserved adults; and ClearlyEnergy, which uses climate policy analysis and software development to create a sustainable and energy-efficient future.

In response to these funding cuts, members of the Maryland Congressional delegation released a statement condemning both the shutdown and the attack on clean energy and sustainability initiatives, calling the dismantling of these projects “partisan” and “likely illegal.”

“Terminating these lawfully approved projects will raise energy prices for Maryland families, threaten good-paying American infrastructure jobs and prevent local energy companies from enhancing grid flexibility and improving the resilience of the power system against extreme weather,” delegation members wrote.

In the joint statement, delegates stated they consider the termination of such projects as the current administration’s way of leaving American business and families to fend for themselves.

“We will continue pushing Republicans to responsibly fund the government and end this shameful shutdown,” the group of Maryland leaders continued.

Washington will also be affected by the DOE’s cuts, as a $4.8 million reward to the Interstate Renewable Energy Council (IREC) was canceled, per the House Appropriations Committee’s list. Since the IREC is a nonprofit that is adamantly building the foundation for accessible renewable energy, and the District has a goal of completely relying on clean energy sources by 2032, this could be detrimental to the city’s vision for a sustainable future.

As Congress remains in a standstill— not able to agree on a funding plan— more environmental programs are at risk of being cut, threatening the fight for cleaner and affordable energy and the preservation of treasured landscapes.

“Government shutdowns are painful, but the pain the Trump administration has inflicted on the American people has arguably been even worse,” Scott, who has served as CCAN’s policy director since 2021. “Reopening the government in a bipartisan way is the only path forward.”",https://www.washingtoninformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-94.jpg,N,,2025-10-15 17:09:08.883761

Here's Why It Could Be Overkill,Andrei Nedelea,,,,,https://insideevs.com/news/775817/600kw-chargers-coming-america-2026/,"There are no EVs currently available or even planned for release in the U.S. that need that much charging power.

That includes EV charging infrastructure.
That's being billed as a game-changer in China because it puts EV charging on par with the time it takes to fill up a gas car.
ChargePoint will begin rolling out 600 kW chargers in the country, promising they will top up an EV in 10 minutes.","ChargePoint plans to roll out 600-kW chargers starting next year.

There are no EVs currently available or even planned for release in the U.S. that need that much charging power.

The most powerful EV chargers currently operational in America top out at 400 kW.

By now, it's no secret that China is way ahead in the electric-vehicle race, and the rest of the world has little potential of catching up. That includes EV charging infrastructure. The Chinese market now has several cars for sale that charge at 1 megawatt—1,000 kilowatts—and public charging stations are ready to provide that power.

In practical terms, that means EV recharging can be done in about five minutes or so. That's being billed as a game-changer in China because it puts EV charging on par with the time it takes to fill up a gas car.

Right behind China is Europe, which has lots of EVs and an expansive network of chargers. But no cars here charge quicker than 400 kW, and there are only a handful that can hit that number.

But even more powerful chargers are coming to the U.S. next year, according to USA Today. ChargePoint will begin rolling out 600 kW chargers in the country, promising they will top up an EV in 10 minutes.

Now, that would be true if there were any EVs that can take that kind of charging power, but there aren’t—and none are on the horizon, either in the U.S. or in Europe.

Europe’s most powerful chargers generally top out at 420 kW, although these are pretty rare. Some 600 kW units are coming this year and next. In the U.S., Gravity offers the most powerful chargers around, which provide up to 500 kW of power. But only EV is currently on sale that charges at more than 350 kW. The Lucid Gravity can take 400 kW, and it will be joined next year by the BMW iX3 and Porsche Cayenne EV, which will match it.

These 600 kW stalls will be present in ChargePoint Express charging stations with help from electronics giant Eaton. The charging giant notes that these new chargers will require a 30% lower investment than before, have a 30% smaller footprint and bring a 30% reduction in operating costs.

The company didn’t say exactly how many of these it plans to roll out or where they will be installed, but it is future-proofing these chargers while waiting for EVs with more charging power to appear on the U.S. market.

When will we see EVs capable of taking 600 kW of power in the States? Well, there are no plans by American or European manufacturers to make any with those kinds of numbers, so unless the sky-high import tariffs on Chinese electric cars disappear overnight and the market gets flooded by fast-charging models from the People’s Republic (which may happen in neighboring Canada), it doesn’t look like it will be anytime soon.

You can’t really charge a 400-volt EV much higher than 250 kW. Teslas and the Volvo EX90 are examples of EVs that run on 400-volt architectures and can achieve that peak charging rate. But to go higher than that, you need to go to 800 volts or more, because otherwise you would need such a high amperage that no public charger could provide. Cars like the Porsche Macan EV and the upcoming BMW iX have a voltage close to that. And the Lucid Gravity actually runs at over 900 volts (up to 926 volts, to be precise), similar numbers to China’s EVs capable of megawatt charging rates.

For more info, read our Privacy Policy & Terms of Use.

So Lucid could, in the future, update the Gravity (and the Air sedan, which currently tops out at 300 kW) to charge even quicker because they have the voltage to do it. But otherwise, there’s not much use for 600 kW chargers in the United States with the current outlook for EVs. Hyundai and Kia recommend a 350 kW charger for their E-GMP-based EVs to be able to achieve their full charging potential, although they don’t charge at more than 240 kW currently, even with their 800-volt architecture.

This is because only a 350 kW charger can sustain the 800 volts and 300 amps that these cars need to reach the peak advertised charging power. You can still charge them from a 250 kW charger, and they will still have excellent charging performance, but they won’t reach the advertised peak. So there is a point to having chargers that provide more than a vehicle’s maximum claimed charging power, but there are currently no cars that require 600 kW.

We actually tried China’s five-minute chargers with peak speeds of over 1 megawatt, and once you see one in action and how quickly it actually replenishes a battery, the Lucid Gravity, with its 10%-80% charging time of around 23 minutes, isn’t as impressive. BMW says the iX3 can do the 10%-80% charging dash in 21 minutes, but nobody has tested one to see how well it actually does.",https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/MkM9XN/s1/chargepoint-and-eaton.jpg,N,,2025-10-15 18:11:03.887419

Clint Woods spoke at a recent hearing about the Clean Air Act at the U.S. House Committee on Energy and Commerce.

The last major update to the Clean Air Act was 35 years ago. Though rules that come out of the act are updated more frequently — like the National Ambient Air Quality Standards, which are updated about every five years.

On the new limits for soot

Woods said the federal government should repeal the Biden administration's standard for soot — pollution that can harm your heart and lungs that often comes from things like cars, factories and coal plants.

The Environmental Protection Agency under former President Joe Biden lowered the amount of soot allowed from 12 micrograms per cubic meter to 9 micrograms. Woods said while most of Indiana is expected to meet the stricter standard, it's doesn't leave much ""headroom.""

""It really limits the ability of new investment to come in — whether that's a data center new energy generation opportunity for advanced manufacturing. And so, that really is a limiting factor in a state like ours,"" Woods said.

Woods called the standard ""legally and scientifically dubious"" but didn't explain why. Like most EPA rules, industry had the opportunity to weigh-in on the new soot standard.

READ MORE: EPA rule to limit soot could save lives, especially in Indiana's metro areas

Janet McCabe served as the deputy EPA administrator under Biden. She is a visiting professor with the Indiana University McKinney School of Law and affiliated with IU's Environmental Resilience Institute.

She said the National Ambient Air Quality Standards — like the one for soot — are one of the biggest decisions that the EPA takes on.

""It is highly documented and supported. And I actually think that of all the pollutants out there, there is the most agreement around particulate matter,"" McCabe said. ""The science shows that there is no threshold below which it is safe to breathe in particulate matter. The risk gets less and less as you get lower and lower. But the in terms of lives saved and health improved, when you lower that standard, you are protecting public health. So I really would wonder about statements that question the how well that decision was supported.""

The new standard is expected to save thousands of lives in the U.S. every year — including in Indiana's metro areas.

On EPA's review of state decisions

Woods said the EPA often ""second-guesses"" Indiana's decisions — like its plans for implementing federal air quality standards and the permits it grants for facilities that pollute. He said this causes delays, threatening the state's ability to compete for business.

""[EPA's review process sometimes] expands issues that are not within that key provision of the act and that narrowing that review process would go a long way to ensure that you don't have delays in key projects and that state-led delegated programs that work effectively in providing environmentally protective and legally durable permits could move much more quickly,"" Woods said.

McCabe said when permit reviews take a while, it's often because there are complicated issues at play. She said it's the agency's job to make sure things like permitting are done properly and consistently across the country.

""This is a partnership and EPA should not be micromanaging states — but does have a legitimate role to play,"" she said. ""Especially when members of the public have brought questions to EPA about either whether things are properly explained, whether input from the community has been responded to and and whether decisions are adequately explained and documented.""

On wildfire smoke and pollution that crosses state lines

Woods said the Clean Air Act also needs to do more to ensure that states like Indiana aren't penalized for pollution that's out of its control — like wildfire smoke from Canada or ozone pollution that may have drifted from Chicago.

""A week or two of catastrophic wildfire in California emits more greenhouse gasses an entire year of all energy-related activity in Indiana. So those things are incredibly impactful,"" Woods said.

He said environmental regulators now have a better ability to understand where pollution is coming from than what they did 35 years ago — and those tools need to be updated.

McCabe said while states shouldn't be held responsible for pollution they can't control, it's important for the EPA to make sure wildfires are, in fact, the cause of that excess pollution.

""We're having more and more of these [wildfires]. If you have a couple a year, then it's not so hard. If you have dozens and dozens and dozens a year, then it they can build up and become a backlog and take a long time. And and so it's not crazy to say, let's look at that process and make sure it's as efficient as possible,"" she said.

McCabe said the issue of pollution crossing state lines into Indiana is nothing new. It's part of the reason why the Lake Michigan Air Directors Consortium exists — to help understand what causes air pollution in the region and discuss solutions.

""But you also need to pay attention to what the people who live in your state are exposed to day to day, and do your best to protect them from even more air pollution,"" she said.",https://www.wfyi.org/files/wfyi/articles/original/file_RG27MHJ0.jpg,N,,2025-10-15 17:09:13.524806

Every time you turn on a light switch, a complex system delivers electricity from power plants to your home. This system, the electric grid, includes the bulk power system (BPS) and the distribution system, and it works 24/7 to keep the lights on.

What is the bulk power system (BPS)?

The electric “grid” delivers electricity from producers to consumers. It includes the:

Generation system

Transmission system

Distribution system

The “Bulk Power System” (BPS) includes the generation and transmission systems. The North American Electricity Reliability Corporation (NERC) defines the BPS as “the facilities and control systems necessary for operating an interconnected electric energy transmission network (or any portion thereof); and electric energy from generation facilities needed to maintain transmission system reliability. The term does not include facilities used in the local distribution of electric energy”Footnote 1.

Maintaining the reliability of the BPS is crucial to ensuring the overall reliability of the electric grid.

Figure 1: Bulk Power System (BPS)

BPS reliability

Most Canadian provinces follow NERC’s reliability standards. Each province is responsible for maintaining the reliability of its BPS. NERC defines BPS reliability in terms of two parts:

AdequacyFootnote 2 means having enough resources to provide electricity at the proper voltage and frequency to continuously meet customer demand, virtually all the time. This is more generally referred to as resource adequacyFootnote 3 and is evaluated at the planning stage. In this planning stage, power system planners look ahead to predict how much electricity will be needed in the future, and make sure enough power plants and other resources will be available to meet that need, including some extra capacity for emergencies.

Operating reliabilityFootnote 4 refers to always keeping the power on—the ability of the electric system to withstand sudden and unexpected disturbances like short circuits or unplanned outagesFootnote 5. This is an issue that is managed in real time in the operational stage.

A reliable BPS is one that meets both these conditions, virtually all the time. An indicator of grid reliability difficulties is the Energy Emergency Alert (EEA). EEAs are alerts sent out by system operators during major grid events. These alerts are classified at different levels by NERC; level 3 being the most criticalFootnote 6, indicating the highest threat to grid reliability. Considering one of the provinces, Alberta for example, EEA events increased notably during 2022-2023, with four EEA 2 events and seven EEA 3 events in 2022. The trend continued into 2024 with six EEA-3 events, indicating sustained grid stress during this period.

Managing unplanned outages

The reliability of the BPS can be impacted by unplanned outages, which can be caused by extreme weather conditions and create reliability issues if the power system isn’t flexible. Operators need to adjust quickly by redispatching other generators or by using operating reserves. Without adequate resources, the system may struggle to respond to unplanned outages, leading to potential reliability issues. Also, if there are no alternative transmission lines, or if the existing ones are congested, it can be even more challenging.

Recent extreme weather events surfaced these challenges across Canada. For example, in January 2024, Alberta narrowly avoided a rolling blackout during a severe cold weather event that also restricted electricity importsFootnote 7. With transmission lines from neighboring provinces congested and limited operating reserves available, the Alberta Electricity System Operator (AESO) took measures to maintain power supply, including asking residents to reduce their electricity usageFootnote 8. Later, in March 2025, a major ice storm left over a million customers without power in Ontario, with some outages lasting over a week due to extensive damage to transmission and distribution infrastructureFootnote 9. The widespread damage limited available transmission alternatives and overwhelmed system operators’ ability to redispatch resources.

How will future trends affect reliability?

Electricity demand is expected to increase significantly in the coming yearsFootnote 10. Trends driving increased demand include electricity’s projected role in decarbonization efforts, with growing electrification of end-uses (like increased electric vehicle use and heat pump adoption).Footnote 11 Further, new areas of demand growth, like data centers (ex. used to power AI) could also lead to increased growth in electricity demand.

Meeting this rising electricity demand could be a reliability challengeFootnote 12. Higher electricity consumption could make it difficult for grid operators to reliably provide sufficient power during peak periods.

To meet increased demand while keeping costs and emissions from electricity generation low, additional supply from clean energy sources is widely expected across energy forecasts. Even in scenarios that reflect current policies, many reports project substantial growth in variable renewable energy sources (VRES) like wind and solar, primarily due to their competitive costs.Footnote 13 Net-zero scenarios naturally show even greater VRES deployment. However, due to their intermittency, VRES must be managed carefully to maintain grid reliability.

Weather conditions also affect consumer electricity demand patterns. During extreme weather events, like heat waves or cold snaps, demand sometimes peaks while VRES output drops, leading to supply shortfallsFootnote 14. On the other hand, when weather conditions are ideal for VRES generation, output may be high while demand is low, resulting in supply surplusFootnote 15. This variability poses a challenge for the grid because, unlike conventional generators, solar and wind technologies lack the ability to adjust their output and are not easily dispatchable.

Ways to improve reliability

To ensure a reliable grid, the power system must continuously and safely operate during equipment outages, supply shortfalls, or surpluses. This requires a flexible grid, having the right mix of supply and transmission assets capable of responding to sudden changes in demand or unplanned outages.

One example of how grid reliability can be maintained is supply diversification by integrating VRES with dispatchable technologies such as battery storage and conventional power plants. Battery storage can store excess power during periods of surplus and provide power when needed, while other dispatchable technologies can provide base load capacity to complement VRESFootnote 16.

Increasing transmission capacity through new transmission lines or non-wire solutions (such as dynamic line rating) can facilitate power transfer from areas with surplus to those experiencing shortfalls. Demand management solutions, like enhanced demand response and the adoption of more energy-efficient devices, can also alleviate grid load.

Widespread grid modernization efforts could help improve reliability. This may include proposing new market structures, integrating new technologies like more accurate forecasting, advanced smart metering, grid automation and Internet of Things (IoT) technology, and energy storage systemsFootnote 17Footnote 18.

However, as grid modernization helps improve reliability, new vulnerabilities are also being introduced. These vulnerabilities involve physical and cyber threats and can be seen in smart grids, IoT sensors, and automated systems. To maintain reliability, modernized grids require safeguarding to manage and mitigate these new risks.

In the last year alone, Priority Hire workers earned $16 million in wages, plus benefits.
Residents and experienced construction workers from Seattle’s most racially diverse ZIP code 98118 uncovered a lack of local workers on City construction projects.
“We are honored to join Mayor Bruce Harrell, City leaders and staff as well as other community leaders to celebrate the tenth year of the City of Seattle’s impactful Priority Hire program.
“The past 10 years have shown that programs like Priority Hire can be transformative,” said District 4 Councilmember Maritza Rivera, who’s been a strong proponent of the Priority Hire program.","Seattle –Today, Mayor Bruce Harrell joined the Department of Finance and Administrative Services (FAS), union leaders, contractors, and training and community partners today to celebrate the 10-year impact of the City’s Priority Hire program.

Created in 2015 through a City Ordinance co-sponsored by then-Councilmember Harrell, the program is operated by FAS and establishes a community workforce agreement (CWA) among the City and labor partners. The CWA creates hiring goals that prioritize workers from economically distressed communities on City construction projects totaling $5 million or more.

“For over a decade, Seattle’s landmark Priority Hire program has opened doors for workers from historically underserved communities, connecting them with competitive paying construction and clean energy jobs,” said Mayor Harrell. “This program has served as a regional and national model for how we can invest in our communities and advance economic mobility, racial equity, and environmental justice goals. As we celebrate this milestone, we remain committed to building a city where everyone – regardless of their zip code or background – can access job opportunities and thrive.

Since its creation, construction workers who’ve gone through the program have earned $120 million dollars in wages—an amount that’s estimated to be double what they would have earned without Priority Hire. Many of these workers are BIPOC and women. In the last year alone, Priority Hire workers earned $16 million in wages, plus benefits.

“The Priority Hire program is helping ensure residents receive a fair share of wealth-generating construction jobs,” said FAS Director Kiersten Grove, whose department manages the program. “Thanks to the collective work of community, public-private partners, labor unions, contractors, and training partners, women and BIPOC workers have increased their share of hours worked on City projects by 60 percent since the program started, from 25 percent to 40 percent in 2024. And these jobs have a real and immediate impact on workers and their families.”

The program was created following the demolition and construction of the Rainier Beach Community Center. Residents and experienced construction workers from Seattle’s most racially diverse ZIP code 98118 uncovered a lack of local workers on City construction projects. They formed a coalition to increase access to work on large public works project and City leaders responded with the passage of the historic Priority Hire Ordinance in 2015. The ordinance was designed to expand economic opportunity and employment to racially diverse and economically disadvantaged Seattle area residents and, since its creation, has been a model throughout the region and nation that others have adopted.

“Priority Hire is one of those neighborhood derived policies that helps Seattle realize its promise as a city able to support the dreams and aspirations for all that come here, particularly those that settle in underinvested neighborhood,” said Gregory Davis, Managing Strategist at Rainier Beach Action Coalition.

The City estimates that apprentices on Priority Hire projects in 2024 earned about double the minimum wage of $19.97 an hour in Seattle, plus benefits. And workers who started as apprentices on the City’s earliest projects are now leaders in labor unions, contracting firms, and training programs — reshaping the industry from within.

“We are honored to join Mayor Bruce Harrell, City leaders and staff as well as other community leaders to celebrate the tenth year of the City of Seattle’s impactful Priority Hire program. Priority Hire fosters economic opportunity through careers in construction and pathways out of poverty for the most vulnerable through apprenticeship. The good, family-wage construction jobs for skilled craftspeople supported through this successful program are helping build better lives. We deeply value our partnership with the City of Seattle, and we are excited to keep strengthening and expanding the program,” said Monty Anderson, Executive Secretary, Seattle Building & Construction Trades Council.

As part of the program, Mayor Harrell issued a directive that recommits the City to the Priority Hire program and directs FAS to establish an interdepartmental team composed of representatives from all City departments that participate in or support private projects with significant City investment.

The City will build off of its success and investments in long-term worker success. Since 2016, the City has put $9.6 million toward construction outreach, training, and wraparound support – helping a thousand community members discover and access construction careers they might not have otherwise considered. In 2024, 30 percent of the City-funded pre-apprenticeship graduates who entered apprenticeship were women.

“The past 10 years have shown that programs like Priority Hire can be transformative,” said District 4 Councilmember Maritza Rivera, who’s been a strong proponent of the Priority Hire program. “As the daughter of a welder, I am proud to support this program that creates economic opportunities for people of color, women, and residents from economically troubled communities. This program is a national model for how to create long-term life-changing wages for Seattle communities.”

“What Seattle’s Priority Hire has meant to me personally is seeing hundreds of our Carpenter and other building trades pre-apprenticeship graduates step onto jobsites and into life-changing careers that support their families and futures,” said Marianna Hyke, Western States Regional Council of Carpenters and Priority Hire Advisory Committee Member. “It’s been incredible to witness how this program has brought education, pre-apprenticeship, apprenticeship programs, and contractors closer together, building real partnerships that strengthen our workforce. Most importantly, it has uplifted our local communities that are too often overlooked, helping small, minority, and women-owned businesses grow while transforming lives across our region.”",https://harrell.seattle.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/23/2025/10/DSC3137-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-15 17:08:40.338397

Earlier this month, the U.S. Department of Energy announced it was cancelling more than $7.5 billion in federal funding for clean energy projects across 16 states. That included cancelling 38 projects in Colorado.

Much of the clean energy funding came from the 2021 Infrastructure and Jobs Act and the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, two key legislative priorities of former President Joe Biden.

In an Oct. 14 letter to U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright, Sens. Michael Bennet and John Hickenlooper and Reps. Joe Neguse, Jason Crow, Brittany Pettersen and Diana DeGette said the cancellations “will result in the abandonment of cutting-edge research and private-sector investments, threatening Colorado jobs and energy affordability.”

The funding was designated for a wide range of projects across private industries, utilities, universities, state agencies and rural electric cooperatives, the lawmakers said. Those investments included university testing facilities, grid reliability improvements, rural cooperative load management, oil and gas infrastructure upgrades and dispatchable power for transitioning communities.

“We are concerned about the effect of these cancellations on Colorado’s workforce, economy, and energy costs,” the lawmakers wrote in their letter to Wright, a longtime oil and gas industry executive from Colorado.

“As a Colorado native, you know firsthand that families, farmers and businesses across our state depend on affordable, dependable energy to power their homes, grow their crops and sustain local economies,” their letter continued.

Lawmakers pressed Wright for “detailed responses” to a list of questions about the Department of Energy’s justification for cancelling projects in Colorado, including how many of the 38 projects had a signed legal contract in place.

They also asked Wright whether he had sought the input of longtime department staff or an external review when deciding what projects to cancel, whether the department had analyzed what the cancellations would mean for the economy, and information on how to appeal.

The Department of Energy, when it announced the cancellations, said entities would have 30 days to appeal the decision. Lawmakers asked what the criteria are for a project’s funding to be reinstated and how long it could take to renew that funding.

The funding cutoffs are part of a larger push by the Trump administration to overturn Biden-era climate policies that it has labelled “‘green’ corporate welfare.” Trump’s marquee domestic policy bill from this summer included a rollback of subsidies for electric vehicles and clean energy home upgrades, as well as an end to tax breaks for clean energy projects for the private sector.

Wright, in a statement earlier this month , framed the cancellation of $7.5 billion in projects as a way to save money for taxpayers. He said the funding had been “rushed through in the final months of the Biden administration with inadequate documentation by any reasonable business standard.”

“President Trump promised to protect taxpayer dollars and expand America’s supply of affordable, reliable and secure energy,” Wright said. “Rest assured, the Energy Department will continue reviewing awards to ensure that every dollar works for the American people.”

Along with the draft template, CARB also posted an explanatory memorandum.

This draft guidance from CARB is potentially helpful for reporting entities to understand what CARB will require in future reporting years, especially given that the legislative deadline for CARB to issue implementing regulations passed several months ago, as explained in our previous post. In recent months, CARB has been focused on presenting concepts for its regulations and identifying entities subject to reporting, as explained here.

The comment period will remain open until October 27, 2025. Interested parties can submit comments on the online docket or via email to climatedisclosure@arb.ca.gov.

Overview of the Climate Corporate Data Accountability Act

SB 253 is aimed at creating transparency for the public regarding reporting of GHG emissions for certain larger businesses. To that end, it requires “reporting entities” to disclose their GHG emissions in a format accessible to the public. Reporting entities are broadly defined as entities with an annual revenue exceeding $1 billion that “do business in California.” Inaugural reporting of Scope 1 and 2 emissions starts next year, despite the fact that CARB is still working on implementing regulations to clarify requirements. CARB is expected to set the exact reporting deadline in these upcoming regulations.

The New Draft Template

The explanatory memorandum states that CARB intends for the draft template to “streamline reporting, especially for entities disclosing GHG emissions for the very first time.”[1] Use of the template is, however, voluntary for the 2026 reporting cycle.

The draft template lists 74 mandatory fields and 100 optional fields for future reporting years. It contains fields for expected types of information, like general organization identification information and contact information. It also includes several technical questions tied to the emission disclosures requirements of SB 253, necessitating extensive data collection and verifiable calculations to answer. The questions are categorized, and the data type (i.e., text or numeric) is identified. The table organizes Scope 1 emissions disclosures by mobile, stationary, or fugitive sources.

One of the key issues related to SB 253 is how an organization is defined for reporting purposes – i.e., where to draw the line around the entity that is reporting the information. The template asks questions on how the entity defines its organizational boundaries, leaving entities with a choice of which approach to use, of those provided for under the Greenhouse Gas Protocol (i.e., equity share, financial control, or operational control approach). The template also asks questions about the entity’s emission reductions associated with use of renewable electricity or renewable gas. The majority of the optional questions are variations of the mandatory emissions questions but focused on a specific greenhouse gas. There is also an optional question allowing the entity to explain any limitations or uncertainties in the report.

Again, use of the template for reporting in 2026 is voluntary. CARB noted that it will publish further guidance on reporting as part of the regulatory process",https://www.hunton.com/the-nickel-report/assets/images-t1760560271/201213.png,N,,2025-10-15 17:09:27.977961

CICIL’s business model poses a bigger question: Could sustainability be the future of North Carolina textiles?","DURHAM, N.C. – For decades, North Carolina’s textile industry has been in freefall. Since the 1990s, the state has lost more than 80% of its textile jobs, leaving behind shuttered mills and fading traditions, according to the North Carolina Department of Commerce.

But a handful of small companies and researchers believe the industry could be on the cusp of a new chapter–one focused less on mass production and more on sustainability, transparency and regional supply chains.

The question is whether such an approach can scale and whether consumers are willing to support it.

A changing industry

Textiles were once synonymous with North Carolina manufacturing. The state’s textile mills powered the state’s economy for more than a century, employing generations of families and anchoring small-town life.

At the sector’s peak in the mid-20th century, North Carolina produced more than 40% of U.S. textiles. But when companies began chasing cheaper labor overseas in the late 20th century, that dominance unraveled with globalization.

Between 1993 and 2022, employment in North Carolina’s textile industry fell by 85%, according to the Department of Commerce. In 1996, more than 2,100 plants employed over 230,000 workers. By 2006, employment dropped to about 80,000.

“North Carolina was built on textiles. But in the 1990s and 2000s, jobs moved overseas and the industry hollowed out,” said Dr. Kativa Mathur, a professor at N.C. State University’s Wilson College of Textiles. “What we’re seeing now is not the end of textiles, just something new.”

What remains is a smaller, more specialized sector. Mills that once churned out low-cost apparel fabrics now focus on industrial materials, performance fabrics and, increasingly, sustainable products.

The push for sustainability

Beyond economics, environmental stakes loom large. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency estimates textiles accounted for 17 million tons of municipal solid waste in 2018, with a recycling rate under 15%.

The shift towards sustainable business reflects broader consumer and environmental pressures. Globally, textiles are responsible for an estimated 6% to 8% of greenhouse gas emissions, according to a 2023 study published in Frontiers in Environmental Science. Synthetic fibers, which make up about two-thirds of clothing worldwide, shed microplastics that pollute waterways and contribute to long-term waste.

That has spurred interest in natural fibers like cotton and wool, as well as more transparent supply chains. North Carolina is uniquely positioned to meet these demands: The state is home to one of the world’s leading textile research hubs, a skilled labor force and a heritage of craftsmanship that startup companies are eager to tap into.

State officials have also pointed to textiles as an area for innovation. Initiatives like the Manufacturing Solutions Center in Conover, North Carolina, are supporting startups and manufacturers experimenting with new materials and business models.

CICIL, a Durham-based rug startup, is one of the several companies trying to test that model.

Its founders, Caroline Cockerham and Laura Tripp, say building their brand around sourcing directly from East Coast farms and manufacturing in North Carolina is designed to break from the very practices that unraveled the industry in the first place.

“We like to say we’re textile nerds,” said Cockerham, who studied at NC State’s College of Textiles before working with Tripp as material developers at a California-based clothing company. “We saw firsthand how global supply chains were broken. There was slave labor in cotton, false claims about organic sourcing and products being made in places the brand didn’t even know about. It was backwards.”

Frustrated by that opacity, the pair founded CICIL in 2021 with a simple mission: rebuild a transparent, regional textile supply chain. Instead of outsourcing production, they turned to East Coast farms and a third-generation mill in North Carolina, creating toxin-free rugs that travel fewer than 1,000 miles from sheep to showroom.

“We said, ‘We have these beautiful heritage textiles in our backyard. Why aren’t we using them?’” Cockerham said. “We built the supply chain first, then created the product that worked for it.”

Farmers find opportunity

For small and mid-sized wool farms, which often struggle to compete against global commodity prices, companies like CICIL provide rare stability.

“My partner and I started with 4-H animals when we were kids, and we just never gave it up,” said Siri Swanson, a Vermont farmer and sheep shearer who supplies to CICIL. “Shearing became our launching pad into farming full-time, but selling wool is tough. It’s too small for the commodity market, too big for just farmers’ markets. CICIL stepped in and gave us an outlet.”

Swanson said the partnership not only sustains her farm but also offers a model for others.

Unlike traditional textile companies, which often externalize environmental costs and rely on opaque supply chains, CICIL builds sustainability into each decision, Cockerham said. The company pays fair prices for wool that might otherwise be discarded and ensures production remains regional, prioritizing accountability.

CICIL’s rugs avoid synthetics, dyes and harsh chemicals. The natural fibers not only make them biodegradable but also highlight the unique colors of wool sourced from small farms.

Can it scale?

CICIL’s business model poses a bigger question: Could sustainability be the future of North Carolina textiles?

Mathur said the industry is at a crossroads. “The challenge is that sustainable textiles cost more. Consumers say they want them, but not everyone is willing to pay a premium,” she said.

According to the National Retail Federation, over 53% of U.S. consumers think sustainable products cost too much.

Although a PwC’s 2024 Voice of the Consumer Survey cites, “while the cost-of-living pressures weigh, some consumers say they are willing to pay 9.7% more, on average, for sustainably produced or sourced goods.”

A wool rug from CICIL starts at several hundred dollars, far more than synthetic alternatives available at big-box stores.

Mathur also cautioned that small startups alone cannot revive an entire industry. “To scale, we need investment in infrastructure, modernized mills and strong consumer demand,” she said.

The type of consumer who supports companies like CICIL are fond of the quality and uniqueness of the products. “I love anything different and alternative and I discovered CICIL on a Google search,” said Pam Parker, a South Carolina resident and a frequent consumer of CICIL.

“I’ve purchased three rugs and I love their fabrics. Their products are different, excellent quality and they have fabulous customer service,” Parker said.

The stakes

Advocates say natural fibers and regional supply chains could reduce the industry’s footprint, though scaling up remains difficult. The United States produced less than 1% of the world’s wool in 2020, according to the nonprofit Textile Exchange, and sustainable production often requires higher upfront costs.

For CICIL, the mission is about more than rugs.

“Companies like CICIL are a huge light forward for us,” said Swanson, who supplies for over 200 brands. “They are willing to work with our constraints. It is the type of wool we can actually grow here, in this climate. That gives us hope. It shows there’s a path between these tiny operations and the massive community farms.”",https://i0.wp.com/mediahub.unc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/CICIL-200x200.jpg,N,,2025-10-15 21:05:32.784442

Building the Power Backbone for AI

Brookfield and Bloom Energy have announced a $5 billion strategic partnership to build and power the next generation of “AI factories,” combining infrastructure investment with on-site clean power systems to address the surging energy demand driven by artificial intelligence.

The deal marks Brookfield’s first investment under its new AI Infrastructure strategy, which focuses on large-scale facilities designed to integrate compute, power, and capital from inception. Bloom Energy, known for its solid oxide fuel cell systems, will become the preferred onsite power provider for Brookfield’s global AI factory developments.

“AI infrastructure must be built like a factory—with purpose, speed, and scale,” said KR Sridhar, Founder, Chairman and CEO of Bloom Energy. “The lean AI factory is achieved when power, infrastructure, and compute are designed in sync from day one.”

A Grid-Independent Model for AI Expansion

Unlike conventional data centers dependent on legacy grids, AI factories envisioned by the partnership will use behind-the-meter power—energy generated and consumed on-site. This approach offers resilience against grid congestion and instability, which are emerging as critical risks as AI power demand accelerates.

“Behind-the-meter power solutions are essential to closing the grid gap for AI factories,” said Sikander Rashid, Global Head of AI Infrastructure at Brookfield. “Bloom’s fuel cell technology gives us the capability to design and construct modern AI factories with a holistic and innovative approach to power needs.”

Bloom’s fuel cells can generate continuous, dispatchable electricity directly on-site using natural gas, biogas, or hydrogen. Unlike intermittent renewables, fuel cells can provide consistent baseload power with near-zero particulate emissions. This flexibility is increasingly attractive to hyperscale developers and institutional investors navigating regulatory and physical grid bottlenecks.

The first joint AI factory site will be located in Europe, with an announcement expected before year-end.

The Coming Surge in AI Power Demand

AI’s power intensity is quickly redefining data infrastructure. Analysts estimate that AI data centers in the United States alone could exceed 100 gigawatts of power demand by 2035, roughly equivalent to the entire consumption of California today.

That scale of growth has spurred interest in modular, off-grid power solutions capable of being deployed quickly and replicated globally. Bloom Energy’s systems—already operating at facilities run by American Electric Power, Equinix, and Oracle—demonstrate the technology’s viability at industrial scale.

By combining Bloom’s engineering expertise with Brookfield’s project-finance capabilities, the partnership aims to create a repeatable AI factory model that can be adapted to different regional energy markets, policy environments, and fuel sources.

Brookfield’s Growing Digital and Energy Portfolio

Brookfield, with over $550 billion in critical infrastructure assets, has rapidly expanded its exposure to the digital and clean energy sectors. Recent deals include stakes in Compass Datacenters, Duke Energy Florida, and Hotwire Communications, as well as a multi-gigawatt agreement to supply Google with hydropower across the United States.

The AI Infrastructure strategy builds on more than $100 billion Brookfield has invested in digital assets globally, including data centers, fiber networks, and renewable energy. The company sees AI-driven infrastructure as the next convergence point between its energy and digital portfolios.

“Power has become the defining constraint—and opportunity—in the AI era,” said a senior Brookfield executive familiar with the strategy. “Owning and integrating both sides of the equation will determine who scales fastest.”

Global Implications

The Brookfield–Bloom partnership is emerging as a test case for how institutional capital, clean technology, and energy system design can evolve to meet AI’s exponential load growth. As governments tighten net-zero mandates and grid upgrades lag behind, decentralized clean power generation is likely to become a defining theme in global data infrastructure financing.

For C-suite leaders and investors, the partnership signals a structural realignment of how digital infrastructure is financed and powered—where energy autonomy, emissions compliance, and capital efficiency converge to shape the next wave of AI investment.

Administration strips $1 billion for PacNW Hydrogen Hub, risking thousands of jobs and huge regional effort to reduce carbon pollution

WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Maria Cantwell (D-WA), senior member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee and ranking member of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, joined Senate colleagues to demand the Trump administration restore funding for 223 energy projects in Democratic-led states that were unlawfully canceled even though Congress had approved and appropriated funding for them.

“We write in strong opposition to the Trump administration unlawfully cancelling $8 billion in federal investments in 223 energy projects,” the senators wrote to U.S. Department of Energy Secretary Chris Wright and the U.S. Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought. “For the 21 states with impacted projects, your cancellations will mean thousands of lost jobs for Americans, many of whom had every reason to rely on the stability of their jobs before these cancellations and all of whom will face uncertain job markets in our increasingly slowing economy.”

“218 out of 223 projects that were terminated are in states with Democratic leadership. Even in programs where awards were made across all 50 states, such as the Grid Resilience and Innovation Partnerships program, only projects in Democratically led states were cancelled—while similar projects in ‘red states’ remain,” the senators continued.

“These are impacts that will be felt by Americans, regardless of their political views,” the senators concluded. “For the good of our country, the rule of law, and the American people, we demand that you change course and restore the previously awarded funding.”

Earlier this month Sen. Cantwell criticized the Administration’s decision to target the Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Association (PNWH2) as part of the cuts. The PNWH2 supports clean energy efforts in Washington, Idaho, Montana, and Oregon.

“The Trump Administration’s politically motivated decision to strip funds from the pioneering Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Hub is unprecedented and corrupt. Our region was awarded this Hub following an intensive national competition because we showed we had the pioneering researchers, clean energy resources, and over $5 billion in committed local investment that it would take to show that clean hydrogen can work. I will be fighting to restore these funds,” Sen. Cantwell following the administration’s Oct. 1 announcement.

While boosting spending in the US, Stellantis scrapped plans to reopen a Canadian plant that previously employed roughly 3,000 workers.","Stellantis, one of the Big Three automakers in Detroit, said Wednesday it will invest $13 billion in domestic manufacturing efforts over the next four years — heeding President Trump’s call for major companies to bring operations to US shores.

The massive investment will expand domestic production by 50%, including five new vehicle launches, and add more than 5,000 jobs across factories in Illinois, Indiana, Michigan and Ohio, Stellantis stated.

“This investment in the US – the single largest in the company’s history – will drive our growth, strengthen our manufacturing footprint and bring more American jobs to the states we call home,” Stellantis CEO Antonio Filosa said in a Wednesday statement.

“Accelerating growth in the US has been a top priority since my first day,” added Filosa, who took the helm in June and has been eager to boost sales after his predecessor, Carlos Tavares, focused on profits over volumes.

Trump has been pushing US auto giants to ramp up their domestic manufacturing efforts. His tariffs – including a 25% levy on imported car parts and a 50% tariff on foreign steel and aluminum – have squeezed supply chains across the industry.

In June, Stellantis said the tariffs cost the company nearly $350 million in the first half of 2025 as it was forced to pause production at some plants and cut back on shipments of imported vehicles.

Shares in Stellantis – which owns brands like Jeep, Ram and Dodge – jumped 2.3% Wednesday. The stock is down about 20% so far this year.

More than $600 million of the new investment will go toward reopening a plant in Belvidere, Ill., where the production of a new Jeep Cherokee and Jeep Compass will create 3,300 new jobs by 2027, the automaker stated.

A new mid-size truck will be assembled at the company’s Toledo, Ohio, plant thanks to a $400 million investment, the company said. That is expected to create 900 new jobs by 2028.

Nearly $100 million will back the production of a new electric vehicle and large SUV at a Warren, Mich., plant in 2028, which will support 900 new jobs, according to Stellantis.

It said about $130 million will also go to the Detroit plant, where the next-generation Dodge Durango will be manufactured by 2029.

New four-cylinder engines will be produced at the company’s facilities in Kokomo, Ind., starting in 2026 — thanks to a $100 million investment — the company said. The new engines will create more than 100 new jobs, it added.

While boosting spending in the US, Stellantis scrapped plans to reopen a Canadian plant that previously employed roughly 3,000 workers.

The company said its four-year investment plan builds on promises to expand US manufacturing that its chairman, John Elkann, made when Trump took office in January and started pushing big firms to reshore their operations.

“We are heartened by the court’s ruling that LDENR’s refusal to consider the environmental justice impacts of the project violated the Louisiana Constitution. It is past time for LDENR to account for the true costs of its permits on Louisiana’s coastline and communities in terms of loss of wetlands and storm buffers,” said Eric Huber, Managing Attorney at Sierra Club. “This is another in a series of permits by LDNR for the LNG build-out on the Gulf, including the permit for CP2 directly across Calcasieu Pass. We urge LDENR to stop its pro-forma permitting and carry out its mission to protect the public health and welfare of all Louisianans.”

The court found that the Louisiana Department of Energy and Natural Resources (LDENR) violated the Louisiana Constitution by issuing the Coastal Use Permit for the proposed Commonwealth LNG export facility without considering its disproportionate effect on the surrounding communities of color and low-income communities, alongside the climate change impacts and cumulative impacts with other export facilities already in the area.

If built, Commonwealth LNG would permanently destroy over 75 acres of wetlands in the Calcesieu Pass area, and alter hundreds more, adding to the already staggering permanent alteration of over 500 acres of wetlands approved for just two of the neighboring coastal LNG projects. The liquefied methane gas, known as LNG, it would export would have annual greenhouse gas emissions equivalent to 14 coal-fired power plants or 13 million new gasoline powered vehicles.

“This is an area of the Louisiana coastline that is being devastated by LNG facilities,” said Joanie Steinhaus, Ocean Program Director for Turtle Island Restoration Network. “These agencies have long ignored the cumulative impact to air and water quality and the health of the local community members and the environment”

This is not the first court ruling against Commonwealth LNG. In July, 2024, a three judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit rejected the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s (FERC) authorization for this same project. The Court ruled FERC failed to adequately assess the cumulative and direct environmental and health impacts that would be caused by air pollution from the facility. This caused FERC to revise its air pollution analysis and, on Sept. 18, 2025, FERC finally gave the facility the go-ahead to begin site preparation for construction. The Cameron Parish court’s decision however vacated the state coastal use permit, which should effectively stop the project’s construction unless and until a new lawful permit is issued that complies with the Louisiana Constitution.

“Like the rest of the gas export industry, Commonwealth would be a polluting disaster that would destroy fragile fishing areas and further decimate fishing families in southwest Louisiana. It should never have been permitted. We hope this ruling shakes Louisiana to its senses,” said Anne Rolfes, director of Louisiana Bucket Brigade. “On one side are out of state profiteers who export our natural resources and pollute us in the process. On the other are Louisiana families who want to be able to live here and catch and eat our seafood. Commonwealth would destroy our coast and our culture. It would make us more vulnerable to storms. The coastal use permit needs to be revoked.”

There are already six LNG export terminals proposed, approved, under construction, or operating in the area—including Venture Global’s Calcesieu Pass and CP2 facilities. These facilities contribute to the loss of hundreds of acres of wetland and habitat for sensitive species, increased flooding, loss of buffer areas from storms, air and water pollution, and increased risks of catastrophic industrial accidents.

“As a long-term landowner in Cameron Parish who lives adjacent to the Commonwealth LNG site and one mile from Venture Global’s Calcasieu Pass LNG, I see the effects of LNG export terminals every day— the frequent flaring, the noise and light pollution, and destruction of our wetlands and fisheries,” said John Allaire, a resident of Cameron Parish. “It’s a massive burden and destroying our community. I am relieved that the Judge upheld our concerns with Commonwealth LNG, and that LDENR failed the people of Cameron Parish. My hat is off to the local district court for this unbiased decision to hopefully protect the citizens and save a piece of God’s country in Cameron Parish.”

“This ruling is a victory for the people and the wetlands of Southwest Louisiana,” said James Hiatt, Director of For a Better Bayou. “It shows that when our government fails to protect our coast from reckless industrial expansion, the courts can still uphold the law. For too long, communities like ours have carried the burden of pollution, flooding, and destruction while corporations profit. This decision is a reminder that our coast is not a sacrifice zone—it’s our home, and it deserves protection.”",https://i0.wp.com/seaturtles.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/82000.png?fit=1640%2C924&ssl=1,N,,2025-10-15 17:10:24.679455

(AP) — Federal officials rejected a company's bid to acquire 167 million tons of coal on public lands in Montana for less than a penny per ton, in what would have been the biggest U.S. government coal sale in more than a decade.

The failed sale underscores a continued low appetite for coal among utilities that are turning to cheaper natural gas and renewables such as wind and solar to generate electricity. Emissions from burning coal are a leading driver of climate change, which scientists say is raising sea levels and making weather more extreme.

President Donald Trump has made reviving the coal industry a centerpiece of his agenda to increase U.S. energy production. But economists say Trump's attempts to boost coal are unlikely to reverse its yearslong decline.

The Department of Interior said in a Tuesday statement that last week's $186,000 bid from the Navajo Transitional Energy Co. (NTEC) did not meet the requirements of the Mineral Leasing Act.

Agency representatives did not provide further details, and it's unclear if they will attempt to hold the sale again.

The leasing act requires bids to be at or above fair market value. At the last successful government lease sale in the region, a subsidiary of Peabody Energy paid $793 million, or $1.10 per ton, for 721 million tons of coal in Wyoming.

President Joe Biden's administration sought to end coal sales in the Powder River Basin of Montana and Wyoming, citing climate change.

A second proposed lease sale under Trump — 440 million tons of coal near an NTEC mine in central Wyoming — was postponed last week following the low bid received in the Montana sale. Interior Department officials have not said when the Wyoming sale will be rescheduled.

NTEC is owned by the Navajo Nation of Arizona, New Mexico and Utah.

In documents submitted in the run-up to the Montana sale, NTEC indicated the coal had little value because of declining demand for the fuel. The Associated Press emailed a company representative regarding the rejected bid.

Most power plants using fuel from NTEC's Spring Creek mine in Montana and Antelope mine in Wyoming are scheduled to stop burning coal in the next decade, according to an analysis by The Associated Press.

Spring Creek also ships coal overseas to customers in Asia. Increasing those shipments could help it offset lessening domestic demand, but a shortage of port capacity has hobbled prior industry aspirations to boost coal exports.",https://wehco.media.clients.ellingtoncms.com/img/photos/2025/10/15/AP25276571856086_t1200.jpg?57a0c2296240c280e9492005c3cad63e7cbe80f4,N,,2025-10-15 16:09:49.107371

That point was underscored by word from one of Farley’s predecessors, Mark Fields. Fields had a clear assessment of not only Ford, but also all carmakers’ stance on the market. This stand did not hurt Ford shares much, however, as they were up fractionally in Wednesday afternoon’s trading.

Basically, Fields noted, Ford—and most every other United States automaker—overestimated the size of the EV market and started ramping up production before they really had the market to justify it. Fields explained, “Over the last couple of years, the automakers really went full bore in putting in capacity for EVs. They really didn’t have a good discussion on the consumer, in terms of what it was going to take to get the consumer to buy these EV products.”

This echoes the sentiment from Farley, who declared that the EV market was “…way smaller than we thought,” especially once the electric vehicle tax credits were slated for removal.

Price Cuts

But Ford is not planning to go down without a fight. Ford is launching a cost-cutting plan on its F-150 Lightning electric pickup line, and is also augmenting it with some improvements in overall range. With Ford grappling with rival Tesla (TSLA) for the top-seller slot in electric pickups, such a move may help Ford cement its newly-recovered crown.

Ford is paring back costs on the Lightning by as much as $4,000, reports note, and the STX now offers an extra 50 miles of driving range. These may be rather minor improvements, but minor improvements may be enough to sway fence-sitters and turn them into buyers, a definite plus for Ford.

Is Ford Stock a Good Buy Right Now?

Turning to Wall Street, analysts have a Hold consensus rating on F stock based on two Buys, 10 Holds and two Sells assigned in the past three months, as indicated by the graphic below. After a 5.62% rally in its share price over the past year, the average F price target of $11.41 per share implies 2.93% downside risk.

,Texas Environment,2025-10-15 19:38:41+00:00,Los Angeles Times,This green energy company is leaving California for Texas - Los Angeles Times,"Caroline Petrow-Cohen, www.latimes.com, caroline-petrow-cohen",,,,,https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2025-10-15/solar-panel-company-to-leave-bay-area-for-texas,"GAF Energy will relocate its headquarters to Georgetown, Texas, on Dec. 13, the company announced in a notification document filed with state officials.
The company said its decision was motivated by better market opportunities in Texas, rather than an unfavorable business environment in California.
GAF Energy, which is owned by Standard Industries, opened a manufacturing facility in Texas last year.
The consolidation to a Texas headquarters will help the company “drive efficiencies, foster stronger collaboration and partnership amongst teams, and better serve customers,” the spokesperson said.
GAF Energy did not point to faults in California’s business environment as a reason for moving operations to Texas.","A San José-based tech company that sells roof shingles with built-in solar panels is the latest to announce plans to leave the Golden State for Texas.

GAF Energy will relocate its headquarters to Georgetown, Texas, on Dec. 13, the company announced in a notification document filed with state officials. The company said its decision was motivated by better market opportunities in Texas, rather than an unfavorable business environment in California.

The company will lay off 138 California-based employees, including technicians, engineers and managers.

The San José headquarters, which is currently used for research, development and solar panel manufacturing, was opened in 2021. Both in-person and remote employees will be affected by its closure, the notice said.

Required by the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, or WARN, the notice must be issued by a company 60 days before a mass layoff.

GAF Energy, which is owned by Standard Industries, opened a manufacturing facility in Texas last year. The company plans to consolidate its operations at a new headquarters in the state, President Martin DeBono said.

“In light of ongoing changes in the solar industry, we are aligning our business and our team to focus on key markets where solar is most compelling for builders and homeowners,” a company spokesperson said in a statement. “This decision was not taken lightly. We are grateful to our employees in San Jose for their contributions to the business and are committed to assisting those impacted through this transition.”

GAF Energy advertises a more practical approach to rooftop solar energy by embedding solar panels directly into shingles, rather than installing them on top of a roof.

The consolidation to a Texas headquarters will help the company “drive efficiencies, foster stronger collaboration and partnership amongst teams, and better serve customers,” the spokesperson said.

Though Silicon Valley is known as a premier tech hub and incubator for young companies, many firms have left the state in recent years, complaining of strict regulations, high taxes and costly labor.

Tesla moved its headquarters out of Palo Alto in 2021, the same year that financial services firm Charles Schwab relocated from San Francisco to North Texas. Elon Musk moved the head offices of his other companies — SpaceX and X — to Texas last year, as did Chevron, the oil giant that was started in California.

Bed Bath & Beyond’s chief executive Marcus Lemonis recently took aim at California and announced that the company would not reopen stores in the state, writing on X that “California has created one of the most overregulated, expensive, and risky environments for businesses.”

Economists said the state remains the fourth-largest economy in the world, boasts a diverse pool of talent and is a hub of technological innovation.

GAF Energy did not point to faults in California’s business environment as a reason for moving operations to Texas.

The projects funded will replace lead service lines, rehabilitate aging systems, upgrade treatment and service capabilities, and reduce environmental contaminants to ensure Pennsylvanians have access to clean, safe water.

“Every Pennsylvanian has a constitutional right to clean air and pure water — and my Administration is investing historic resources to make sure that right is protected all across our Commonwealth,” said Governor Josh Shapiro. “PENNVEST project help communities modernize their water systems, protect public health, and create jobs — and working together across party lines and all levels of government, we’re getting stuff done, delivering results for the good people of Pennsylvania, and building a stronger, more resilient future.”

“In just the past five years, PENNVEST has seen an 83 percent increase in demand for water infrastructure funding — a clear sign of the need for continued investment across Pennsylvania,” said Robert Boos, Executive Director of PENNVEST. “Our revolving loan model ensures these projects are sustainable for the long term — as loans are repaid, those funds are recycled to support future projects. Thanks to this structure, PENNVEST has been able to fully fund every eligible, shovel-ready application since 2015.”

With the national focus on strengthening infrastructure through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL), PENNVEST has more capacity than ever to provide cost-effective financing for critical water quality projects. PENNVEST continues to adapt and expand opportunities for communities to upgrade their systems and incorporate clean energy solutions — such as solar, anaerobic digesters, and hydropower — that reduce long-term operating costs and qualify for Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) tax incentives.

PENNVEST funding for these projects originates from a combination of state funds approved by voters, Growing Greener funds, Marcellus Legacy funds, the Infrastructure Investment & Jobs Act (IIJA), federal grants from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency under the Clean Water Act and Safe Drinking Water Act, and recycled loan repayments from previous PENNVEST awards.

The former wastewater treatment facility and current site of Pump Station #1 will undergo rehabilitation. This portion of the project will involve the removal of abandoned electrical components and the relocation of the main electrical service out of the floodplain. Additionally, approximately 330 feet of gravity sewer and two (2) manholes located along Orchard Street in Pine Grove Borough will be replaced, and laterals with cleanouts will be installed. This project will eliminate inflow and infiltration from a section of gravity main, reducing flows to the treatment plant.

Snyder County

**Perry Township Municipal Authority – received a $5,889,303 grant for a complete replacement of the wastewater treatment plant and extension of the collection system. The new system will have greater capacity and will consist of all new treatment equipment including an influent pump station, a headworks and screening system, an ultraviolet disinfection system, and aerobic sludge digestion and post equalization equipment. An emergency generator will be installed at the treatment plant to mitigate disruption during power outages. A new building will also be constructed to house system blowers and electrical components, with space for a meeting room, storage, and on-site lab testing. At the completion of this project, the wastewater treatment plant will serve an additional 52 dwelling units that are currently utilizing on-lot sewer systems.

Somerset County

***Municipal Authority of the Borough of Somerset – received a $17,000,000 grant for sewer system improvements. The project will include the replacement or rehabilitation of approximately 40,000 feet of sanitary sewer piping and 200 sanitary sewer manholes, installation of 6,000 feet of stormwater pipe, and installation or replacement of 100 stormwater drainage basins (inlets). This project will reduce downstream wet weather sewage overflows, diminish energy consumption, and ensure the system’s statutory and regulatory compliance.

The project will include the construction of approximately 5,146 feet of low-pressure sewer mains ranging in size from 1 ½ to 4 inches, 79 simplex grinder pumps, and related 1 ½-inch low-pressure sewer laterals, within Kirsta Lane, Carrie Drive, Colonial Drive, April Lane, and Maylyn Avenue. The points of connection from the new low-pressure sewer extension to the Borough’s system will occur at South Park Street, via cored connection to an existing sanitary sewer manhole. Flow from the Colonial Park area will be conveyed through the York Township Mill Creek Interceptor with ultimate treatment at the Springettsbury wastewater treatment plant. At the completion of this project, the wastewater treatment plant will serve residents currently utilizing aging on-lot sewer systems.

Stormwater Projects

Mercer County

Borough of Greenville – received a $621,148 loan to address flooding in the Lebanon and Lancaster Avenue areas of the Borough of Greenville. The project will include the installation of approximately 1,332 feet of 12-inch high-density polyethylene (HDPE) storm sewer pipe, 12 inlets, and stormwater detention units along Lancaster and Lebanon Avenues, with a connection between the two along York Avenue. An additional 216 feet of 15-inch HDPE storm sewer will be installed at the downstream connection. This project will reduce the risk of flooding for roughly 75 households that live along Lebanon and Lancaster Avenues.

Non-Point Source Projects

Clarion County

**Nexgen Dairy, Inc. – received a $966,000 loan for installation of agricultural best management practices (BMPs) at two farms in east central Redbank Township. The project has been designed in two phases – Phase 1 at the main dairy farm and Phase 2 at the satellite farm on Macadam Road. At the main dairy farm, a 121-foot-wide by 14-foot-deep, liquid manure storage facility will be constructed for manure, livestock bedding, and wastewater. At the Macadam Road farm, a 96-foot-long by 42-foot-wide roofed animal heavy-use-area (HUA) and a 32-foot-long by 42-foot-wide roofed manure-stacking area will be constructed. Concrete slabs and walls will be installed under the roof to facilitate manure collection. Roof runoff structures on the new facility will mitigate stormwater runoff into the pastures to the south of the new facility. The project will reduce sediment and manure from reaching Pine Creek and Nelson Run, the former of which is directly impaired due to agricultural activities. A high-water quality benefit is anticipated based on an estimated reduction of 8,200 pounds of nitrogen, 1,373 pounds of phosphorus, and 2,000 pounds of miscellaneous sediment due to the implementation of these BMPs.

,North Carolina and Evs,2025-10-15 19:24:38+00:00,FleetOwner,Ford Pro and Southern Company demonstrate dynamic pricing and fleet charging ... - FleetOwner,Jade Brasher,,,,,https://www.fleetowner.com/emissions-efficiency/article/55323503/ford-pro-and-southern-company-demonstrate-dynamic-pricing-and-fleet-charging-management-without-impacting-vehicle-uptime,"Ford Pro recently teamed up with Southern Company to help answer some of these electrification questions, especially the fleet-focused ones.
The pilot program sought to answer questions surrounding fleet vehicle charge management at multiple Southern Company locations while charging Ford EVs.
The pilot took place over six months using Southern Company’s own Ford Lightning electric pickup trucks (about 200 of them) and Ford Pro chargers.
Through this pilot, Ford Pro and Southern Company found that these vehicles were sufficiently charged and ready for work even with the staggered charging.
While the pilot with Southern Company was particular to Southern Company’s fleet, Gupta believes the information gathered and data received from the pilot can help other fleets.","There’s no denying that utility companies stand to benefit from the electrification of the automobile and trucking industries. But because electrification is still a relatively new concept—considering the lack of infrastructure, less experience owning electric vehicles (EVs), and more—there are still aspects of widespread electrification that require more research and a little trial and error.

Ford Pro recently teamed up with Southern Company to help answer some of these electrification questions, especially the fleet-focused ones. This Atlanta-based utility company provides electricity to customers in Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi.

The pilot program sought to answer questions surrounding fleet vehicle charge management at multiple Southern Company locations while charging Ford EVs.

“The focus of this pilot was two key levers: to reduce technical and commercial barriers to widespread EV adoption while also adding benefits to the grid,” Ford Pro Product Manager Ananya Gupta told FleetOwner. “It was twofold: How does the grid benefit from this, and how do our customers and commercial customers take advantage of the products and services available to them?”

To accomplish this task, Southern Company and Ford Pro reviewed whether EVs can be used as a “demand response resource” and how to optimize charging through dynamic pricing.

The pilot took place over six months using Southern Company’s own Ford Lightning electric pickup trucks (about 200 of them) and Ford Pro chargers.

Optimizing fleet EV operations through dynamic and smart charging technology

Managing peak grid demand with demand response and staggered EV charging

Ford Pro and Southern Company’s pilot also sought to test the effectiveness of pausing vehicle charging at times when the grid was strained.

Gupta explained that each time these vehicles charge, they consume energy from the grid. If these EVs all charge at scale, that energy puts significant strain on the grid. The Ford Pro team sought to mitigate this strain proactively, Gupta said.

Using technology similar to dynamic charging, which allows the vehicle to accept charge at specific times, demand response can prevent the vehicle from pulling charge when excessive stress is placed on the grid.

“We can take a signal from the grid and say, ‘OK, can you stop charging for a certain time on these assets so that energy can be used somewhere else?’” Gupta said.

While this likely won’t affect your average commercial fleet, managing charging in this way benefits Southern Company by ensuring the electricity it provides is used for essential services across its network, not for its own fleet vehicles.

Using Southern Company’s expertise, the two parties determined the best times to test demand response charging. They tested this at three different times of the day when Southern Company indicated a high demand on grid activity (think: peak times).

Ford Pro then planned for these events within its charging platform, enabling the chargers to receive signals from the grid and ensuring the charging pause and charging restart would happen seamlessly with no human intervention. The pilot proved successful.

“We did three demand response events at different times of the day for different hours, but all of them delivered consistent and verifiable load reductions” on the grid, Gupta said. “In one of the events, we dropped half a megawatt of power from the grid within minutes. That [power] could be redeployed elsewhere or reduce the strain on the grid.”

That half megawatt was reduced by delaying charging for just Southern Company’s fleet. Gupta stressed that the effect could be much more if all EV fleets staggered their charging in this way.

But just because charging these vehicles is made a lesser priority for the grid at a certain time, this doesn’t mean they were neglected. In fact, the goal of this pilot was to ensure no impact on fleet uptime. Through this pilot, Ford Pro and Southern Company found that these vehicles were sufficiently charged and ready for work even with the staggered charging. Gupta put it this way:

“We made sure there was no problem as we did [demand response charging],” he said. Once the demand event was over, “the vehicle started charging again. The charger responded accurately. There was no drop-off in terms of someone needing to come in and plug charging again. It just happened seamlessly, and it was invisible to anyone at the back end. It didn't impact their operations, but it was like a small intervention that we did and tried to see what would happen. It worked really well.""

Ensuring fleet uptime while implementing staggered and managed EV charging

Staggered charging or pausing EV charging might leave a fleet owner, manager, or driver skeptical. What if it doesn’t charge enough to be ready for work when you are? Thankfully, Gupta said Ford Pro chargers recognize when a vehicle’s battery is too low and—if the vehicle needs to be charged by a specific time the next day—won’t interfere with charging if it could jeopardize vehicle uptime.

While the pilot with Southern Company was particular to Southern Company’s fleet, Gupta believes the information gathered and data received from the pilot can help other fleets.

“The lessons and the data from this pilot allow us to tailor-manage charging to each [fleet],” Gupta explained. “Our team has already begun applying these learnings with a large national customer where our energy management platform is driving measurable savings without sacrificing uptime—and that’s the key. Scale isn’t about one-size-fits-all. It's all about using the foundation we've built to adapt intelligently.”

Managed charging also has the potential to enable electric fleet vehicles to reach cost parity with gas-powered fleet vehicles, as charge management software prevents vehicles from charging when rates are highest, as long as uptime allows.

Throughout the pilot, Southern Company was able to reduce its charging demand by half a megawatt during a 30-minute demand response event, and its chargers improved efficiency by approximately 10 kW per charger. That’s a savings that fleets can take to their bottom line.","https://img.fleetowner.com/files/base/ebm/fleetowner/image/2025/10/68efe261bdb3ecfaf52f3143-img_9307.png?auto=format,compress&fit=fill&fill=blur&w=1200&h=630",N,,2025-10-15 16:11:03.389413

The investments will center in the American Midwest, including Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, and Michigan, and almost every Stellantis brand sold here will benefit from the rollout.

Welcome To The Family, GME-T4 EVO

One of the most significant additions to the production cadence will be Stellantis' newest four-cylinder engine. A development of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles' Global Medium Engine (GME) family of four-cylinders, the Hurricane T4 EVO engine is rumored to eventually replace the Pentastar 3.6-liter V6 in most of its existing applications (and spread to corporate partner Alfa Romeo). That could mean the new turbo four will come to the Jeep Grand Cherokee, Chrysler Pacifica, and maybe even the Ram 1500, where it should make at least 300 horsepower and 300 pound-feet of torque – an upgrade from the Pentastar.

The GME-T4 EVO ""Hurricane"" will continue to be built at Stellantis' engine plant in Kokomo, Indiana. The company will invest $100 million into the facility to prepare it for the EVO, which will add 100 new jobs to the plant. The previous-generation GME turbo four, which sees duty in everything from the Alfa Romeo Tonale to the Jeep Wrangler 4xe, was exclusively built in Italy until 2022, when Stellantis added the engine to the Kokomo facility's portfolio for U.S.-market vehicles.

The Belvidere Factory Will Reopen Soon

Upon its closure in 2023, Stellantis' facility in Belvidere, Illinois, was slated to reopen to build a rumored Ram midsize truck. Although that plan didn't come to fruition, the automaker is remaining committed to its existing production framework and will invest $600 million to revitalize FCA Belvidere Assembly to produce the recently revealed Jeep Cherokee and an Americanized version of the global Jeep Compass. Although both are expected for the 2026 model year, the Belvidere-assembled crossovers won't likely roll off the line until 2027. But in the lead-up to that production launch, Stellantis expects to offer around 3,300 new jobs in Illinois.

The midsize Ram pickup will migrate instead to Jeep's factory in Toledo, Ohio, where it will be built alongside the Wrangler and Gladiator. Toledo will receive a $400 million investment and create 900 new jobs to build the truck, which Stellantis says is expected in 2028.

New Trucks And SUVs For Michigan

Stellantis also confirmed that it would build a next-generation version of the Dodge Durango, which will likely share its platform with the Jeep Grand Cherokee, at the Detroit Assembly Complex, earmarking $130 million for the task. And the Warren Truck Plant, which currently builds the Ram 1500 and Jeep Wagoneer and Grand Wagoneer, will also get a $100 million investment to prepare it for a full-size SUV with a range-extended electric powerplant. We presume it'll be the Grand Wagoneer ""REEV,"" a 647-hp SUV that will likely have the same plug-in, series-hybrid powertrain as the recently renamed Ram 1500 REV.",https://static0.carbuzzimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/jp026-023ch.jpg?w=1600&h=900&fit=crop,N,,2025-10-15 17:10:16.008023

“The law is clear: all impacted government employees, regardless of excepted or furloughed status, are entitled to back pay after a government shutdown ends, which is consistent with the guidance currently provided by federal agencies, including the Office of Personnel Management (OPM),” the members wrote. “OPM’s shutdown guidance from September 2025 still states that furloughed federal workers will be provided back pay once the government reopens.”

The members continued, “The decision by OMB to remove critical guidance on federal employee back pay is causing unnecessary stress for the federal workforce comprised of nearly 2.2 million employees.”

“We request you immediately clarify and update the Frequently Asked Questions During a Lapse in Appropriations Document and other relevant materials to affirm that furloughed employees will receive back pay, as is required by law,” the members concluded.

Dear Director Vought:

The Office of Management and Budget’s (OMB) recent update to the Frequently Asked Questions During a Lapse in Appropriations document implies that furloughed federal workers are not entitled to back pay. Additionally, a draft OMB memo stated the administration would deny back pay to furloughed federal workers for the current government shutdown. During the 2018-2019 shutdown, we worked with President Trump to enact the Government Employee Fair Treatment Act (GEFTA) of 2019, the intent of which is clear – federal employees are entitled to retroactive pay in the event of a government shutdown. We applauded President Trump for signing this bipartisan bill into law.

On January 16, 2019, the Senate unanimously passed the Government Employee Fair Treatment Act to guarantee back pay for all impacted federal workers once a government shutdown ends. This law was enacted during the longest government shutdown which lasted 35 days at the end of 2018, and into the beginning of 2019. Prior to the law’s passage, Congress had to pass specific legislation after each shutdown to ensure furloughed workers received back pay.

Explicitly, the law guarantees back pay for all federal employees in the event of a government shutdown. “Each employee of the United States Government or of a District of Columbia public employer furloughed as a result of a covered lapse in appropriations shall be paid for the period of the lapse in appropriations, and each excepted employee who is required to perform work during a covered lapse in appropriations shall be paid for such work, at the employee’s standard rate of pay, at the earliest date possible after the lapse in appropriations ends, regardless of scheduled pay dates, and subject to the enactment of appropriations Acts ending the lapse.” The law requires that retroactive pay be required in the event of any government shutdown after December 22, 2018.

The law is clear: all impacted government employees, regardless of excepted or furloughed status, are entitled to back pay after a government shutdown ends, which is consistent with the guidance currently provided by federal agencies, including the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). OPM’s shutdown guidance from September 2025 still states that furloughed federal workers will be provided back pay once the government reopens. The decision by OMB to remove critical guidance on federal employee back pay is causing unnecessary stress for the federal workforce comprised of nearly 2.2 million employees.

Thus, we request you immediately clarify and update the Frequently Asked Questions During a Lapse in Appropriations Document and other relevant materials to affirm that furloughed employees will receive back pay, as is required by law.",http://evans.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/evans.house.gov/files/evo-media-image/Seal_of_the_United_States_Congress.svg_.png,N,,2025-10-15 16:09:52.286522

In a letter sent Tuesday to Energy Secretary Chris Wright, the Democratic lawmakers railed against the DOE’s “abrupt cancellation of $7.56 billion in energy project funding,” including more than $600 million that had been awarded to 38 Colorado projects.
“DOE investments are vital to lowering costs for consumers and maintaining U.S. leadership in a rapidly evolving global energy landscape,” the lawmakers wrote.

In a letter sent Tuesday to Energy Secretary Chris Wright, the Democratic lawmakers railed against the DOE’s “abrupt cancellation of $7.56 billion in energy project funding,” including more than $600 million that had been awarded to 38 Colorado projects.

Sens. Michael Bennet and John Hickenlooper, and Reps. Joe Neguse, Diana DeGette, Jason Crow, and Brittany Pettersen made the case that the terminations of those projects will not only have “harmful impacts” on Colorado’s workforce and economy, but also on energy costs throughout the state amid the rapid buildout of AI data centers all over the country.

“DOE investments are vital to lowering costs for consumers and maintaining U.S. leadership in a rapidly evolving global energy landscape,” the lawmakers wrote. “In an era where artificial intelligence and data centers are driving a rise in energy demand, we must meet these challenges by investing in responsible and affordable energy solutions, rather than destabilizing them.”

The Energy Department announced the elimination of 321 financial awards supporting 223 projects on the second day of the ongoing government shutdown, proclaiming in a press release that those projects “did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs, were not economically viable, and would not provide a positive return on investment of taxpayer dollars.”

Renewable energy projects were hit especially hard, as the DOE slashed awards issued by the Offices of Clean Energy Demonstrations, Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, and Grid Deployment. Other canceled projects were initiated by the Manufacturing and Energy Supply Chains, Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy, and Fossil Energy offices.

“On day one, the Energy Department began the critical task of reviewing billions of dollars in financial awards, many rushed through in the final months of the Biden administration with inadequate documentation by any reasonable business standard,” Wright said in a statement. “President Trump promised to protect taxpayer dollars and expand America’s supply of affordable, reliable, and secure energy. Today’s cancellation’s deliver on that commitment. Rest assured, the Energy Department will continue reviewing awards to ensure that every dollar works for the American people.”

The Colorado Democrats strongly rejected Wright’s assertion that projects were “rushed” through the process, noting that applicants “underwent rigorous, externally vetted” reviews and had “invested significant private capital, trusting that the federal government would honor their commitments.”

“Some companies now face closure or layoffs as a direct result of these cancellations,” they noted.

A DOE spokesperson said in a statement to FedScoop that the agency “conducted a thorough, case-by-case review of every award. The Secretary’s May memorandum formalized that process, establishing clear standards to safeguard taxpayer resources. The 321 awards terminated failed to meet the standards required to justify continued taxpayer investment and would have led to less reliable, more expensive energy.

“As the Secretary has stated repeatedly, the Department is restoring common sense by prioritizing affordable, reliable, and secure energy while protecting the best interests of the American people.”

The Colorado Energy Office, meanwhile, is bracing for big changes in peak demand, projecting that the state could see a 14% jump between 2024 and 2031. Increases of that kind have become common across the country with the speedy construction of AI data centers, sparking massive pushback from consumers who can’t keep up with their utility bills.

Congress has begun to take note, with one bipartisan House bill introduced last month that calls for a study from the DOE and the departments of Interior and Agriculture into the impact AI data centers are having on rural areas. Trump’s AI Action Plan, however, pushes for the swift buildout of data centers by embracing “new sources of energy to power it all.”

El Paso Electric, the water utility’s biggest customer, consumed an average of 19 million gallons of water daily last year, according to El Paso Water’s financial report.
John Balliew, El Paso Water’s chief executive, has previously said that Meta’s El Paso data center would only need to ramp up water usage on extremely hot days.
And El Paso Electric wants to build new infrastructure that serves the data center, because the utility can earn a profit margin on that capital investment.
“From an El Paso standpoint, we were able to identify an amazing site that had great access to infrastructure and energy,” Davis said about why Meta selected the El Paso site for a new facility.","Technology giant Meta Platforms is investing $1.5 billion to build a data center that will employ 100 workers on a 1,000-acre parcel in far Northeast El Paso near the Texas-New Mexico state line, a scaled-up investment from what the company committed to in late 2023.

The increased investment comes as the global artificial intelligence race has led some of the world’s largest companies to the El Paso area to develop new data center facilities that power the modern internet.

A month after Doña Ana County officials approved a separate $165 billion data center campus that OpenAI and Oracle will develop, Meta representatives for the first time Wednesday announced the company’s El Paso data center project publicly during an event at the Plaza Hotel Pioneer Park in Downtown.

In late 2023, Meta negotiated an incentive package with the city in exchange for investing $800 million and also secured a water supply agreement with El Paso Water. But a Meta executive said the company decided to increase its investment amid the industrywide escalation in AI technology development.

“What you’re seeing here is us having to grow with the needs of our business,” Brad Davis, Meta’s director of data center community and economic development, told El Paso Matters.

“Everything that is ultimately needed with Meta and, frankly, everything that’s needed online, is driven by data centers. They’re the backbone that makes everything in modern society possible, allows us to connect billions of people across the world,” Davis said. “This growth that you’re seeing, a lot of it is driven by AI. This data center itself will be optimized for AI workloads.”

Meta center’s electricity, water usage

Companies have been spending hundreds of billions of dollars in recent years across the United States wherever electricity, water and land are readily available in order to develop data centers that house hardware and computer servers that enable AI products.

Davis said Meta’s new El Paso data center will utilize a “closed-loop” liquid cooling system that will recycle water instead of the water-intensive evaporative cooling technology that older data centers use to keep computer equipment from overheating.

Meta’s water supply agreement with El Paso Water permits the site to use an average of 750,000 gallons of potable water daily initially, and that increases to permitted daily average usage of 1.5 million gallons after the campus is fully built out.

El Paso Water each year supplies around 40 billion gallons of water to customers sourced mostly from groundwater wells and, to a lesser extent, the Rio Grande. El Paso Electric, the water utility’s biggest customer, consumed an average of 19 million gallons of water daily last year, according to El Paso Water’s financial report.

At the full usage detailed in the water supply agreement, the Meta facility will be permitted to consume more water than Marathon Petroleum’s refinery in South-Central El Paso used last year, when it purchased 1.1 million gallons from El Paso Water each day on average.

However, Davis said Meta’s facility will use far less water than the permitted amount.

John Balliew, El Paso Water’s chief executive, has previously said that Meta’s El Paso data center would only need to ramp up water usage on extremely hot days.

“That’s what’s ultimately in our contract. It’s probably a number that’s not necessarily indicative of what actual consumption numbers will necessarily be,” Davis said of the permitted water usage figures. “I’m assuming our consumption numbers will be far less.”

Davis said Meta will report the data center’s electricity and water usage in its annual sustainability report posted on its website along with figures for the two dozen other data centers the company operates in the United States.

In addition to 100 permanent positions, Davis said the site will employ 1,800 workers during the construction phase. He said some early work at the site has started, and the goal is to bring the data center into operation by 2028.

El Paso Electric over the last year developed a special electricity rate for Meta’s data center, which the utility said would require more than 100 megawatts of electricity capacity – enough to power tens of thousands of homes – and would operate at 90% efficiency, meaning the data center’s electricity consumption would rarely fluctuate.

In testimony submitted to the Public Utility Commission of Texas, El Paso Electric executives said they conducted a detailed study to determine how much it would cost to serve the large amount of power Meta’s incoming data center will require. The utility’s rates will ensure the company pays the full cost of service and that Meta will not receive discounted rates, according to the utility’s testimony.

“At full operation, the new Data Center will be EPE’ s largest retail customer,” James Schichtl, vice president of customer and regulatory solutions for El Paso Electric, said in filings submitted to the PUC. “The proposed rates are based on a full cost of service analysis for the expected customer retail load profile and do not represent a ‘discount’ relative to the applicable retail rates that would otherwise apply.”

Before the data center’s rates were finalized in August, Public Utility Commissioner Courtney Hjaltman raised the concern that El Paso Electric customers could subsidize the cost to serve Meta’s data center.

As a result, El Paso Electric guaranteed in writing that the next time it seeks to raise customers’ rates, the utility will “provide evidence” that Meta’s El Paso data center is “not being subsidized by other customers and that the rates contained therein do not constitute discounted rates,” according to filings submitted to the PUC.

Meta’s facility likely will be powered by solar panels, although the full details of its electricity supply aren’t clear. Schichtl told the PUC that El Paso Electric assumed the facility would require two large solar farms to meet its power needs. By comparison, the Project Jupiter data center near the Santa Teresa port of entry will rely on a massive natural gas power plant for its power supply.

In general, El Paso Electric is incentivized to welcome data centers into its service territory. For one, data centers that run constantly are customers that produce steady revenue and cash flow compared with residential customers. And El Paso Electric wants to build new infrastructure that serves the data center, because the utility can earn a profit margin on that capital investment.

While Meta’s facility will directly tie into El Paso Electric’s power grid, the Project Jupiter campus in Santa Teresa will not connect to El Paso Electric’s system and is developing its own isolated electricity generation system.

El Paso Meta data center’s city incentives

The main part of the incentive deal Meta negotiated with the city is an abatement of 80% of city property taxes over 35 years. And the city will give $12.5 million to Meta to improve road infrastructure near the data center.

The city pulled that money from the Texas Economic Development fund, a pot of money established after El Paso Electric agreed to pay the city $80 million over 15 years in exchange for the city’s approval of the acquisition of the utility in 2020 by a J.P. Morgan-owned investment fund.

Local supporters of Meta’s project have said the tax breaks are a good deal for the region because, while the city will forgo most of the new potential tax revenue for decades, other taxing entities will receive full property tax payments from Meta. And it’s possible the taxes Meta pays to the city and local taxing entities could grow over time as Meta invests more in the years ahead to refresh computer equipment at its facility.

Critics of tax breaks for data centers, however, argue the projects strain infrastructure and create relatively few jobs in exchange for foregone tax revenue. The city of Tucson rejected an Amazon-led data center project that would have consumed 2 million gallons of water daily.

“Our community has been clamoring for spreading the tax burden from residential taxpayers to the commercial sector,” said Jon Barela, CEO of the Borderplex Alliance, an economic development organization in the region.

“This project will go very far in absorbing much of that tax burden, especially when it comes to the schools, both the Ysleta school district, El Paso Community College, but also health care,” he said, referring to public health care entities such as University Medical Center of El Paso.

Barela and others have touted the benefits the construction of a Meta data center had on Los Lunas, New Mexico, after construction began there in 2015.

Officials with the New Mexico Economic Development Department have said the population of Los Lunas grew by 20% over the last decade – compared with 1% statewide population growth across New Mexico – and attributed that to Meta’s data center investment there.

“It’s pretty safe to draw a straight line from (Meta’s data center) in Los Lunas to this population growth,” Mark Roper, acting secretary of the New Mexico Economic Development Department, recently told the Doña Ana County Board of Commissioners.

The El Paso region broadly may be seeing the beginning of a regional industry centered around building and servicing data centers.

The El Paso City Council last month voted to give incentives worth $875,000 to a San Jose, California-based technology startup company called Ferveret that develops technology to cool data centers with a liquid solution. In exchange, Ferveret said it would hire 30 workers for its facility located at the so-called Innovation Factory at El Paso International Airport.

“Economic development projects, especially at this level of expenditure, will lead to a clustering of potential other data centers,” Barela said. “But let me be clear: not all data centers are created equal. Meta is a world leader in providing the most efficient and cutting-edge data centers when it comes to environmental footprint,” he said, adding that the company invests heavily to minimize the impact of their data center facilities.

The Project Jupiter data center campus – a wholly separate project from Meta’s but a similar facility meant to enable AI – was welcomed by some residents of Doña Ana County, but was also met with fierce criticism and intense concern from others.

After the Doña Ana Board of County Commissioners approved the Project Jupiter data center project during a meeting in Las Cruces on Sept. 19, residents who had spoken for hours in opposition formed a raucous protest in the chambers and screamed and jeered at the commissioners, largely over concerns that project would be an unsustainable drag on the region’s water apply.

Project Jupiter’s developers have said the campus will consume an average of 20,000 gallons of water per day.

Why did Meta choose El Paso?

Davis declined to comment on the opposition to Project Jupiter, but said the local governments and utilities in El Paso were good and welcoming partners to Meta.

“When we’re going through this process, we want to make sure that a data center suits the needs of that particular community,” he said, adding that Meta plans to partner with the nonprofit Dig Deep, which works to provide first-time water service to colonias that lack water or sewer services.

“From an El Paso standpoint, we were able to identify an amazing site that had great access to infrastructure and energy,” Davis said about why Meta selected the El Paso site for a new facility.

“It has a strong pool of talent that we feel absolutely confident will allow us to construct the data center on an optimal timeline at the quality that we require,” Davis said. “We have no concerns about operational staffing.”

On October 8th, state environmental groups delivered letters to members of Congress signed by organizations and companies across ten states: Alaska, Arizona, California, North Carolina, Nevada, Maine, Michigan, Oregon, Pennsylvania, and Washington.

Why we’re defending appliance energy efficiency standards

Federal appliance energy efficiency standards set minimum energy or water efficiency requirements for certain products. These standards save Americans money every day while reducing emissions by avoiding unnecessary energy generation and use. Updated periodically, the standards ensure that each generation of Americans can do more with less energy.

The next round of updated efficiency standards could save the average U.S. household nearly $150 annually on utility bills over two decades. Nationally, businesses could save $13.8 billion every year.

Appliance energy efficiency standards are a common-sense way to protect the environment, consumers’ wallets, and businesses’ bottom line. That’s why Environment America and ten of our state affiliates worked in partnership with other groups to reach out to businesses and organizations across the country to rally support for these standards.

About the letters

Each state’s letter is signed by several organizations, companies, or non-profits in the state that want Congress to protect federal energy efficiency standards and combat rollbacks of the program. Supporters range from companies to local governments to environmental non-profits.

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) today led 31 senators in calling on the Trump administration to immediately restore the Solar for All program — a landmark initiative Sanders wrote to help working class families afford rooftop and community-based solar energy.
Energy bills are soaring across the country and millions of families are facing higher living costs.
Indeed, electricity bills are 6.2 percent higher than this time last year, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics,” Sanders and the senators wrote.
“EPA’s reckless decision to terminate Solar for All directly undermines efforts by Congress to reduce energy costs and improve grid resilience.
“The EPA’s illegal termination of Solar for All has left states, communities, and businesses across the country in limbo, with critical projects stalled and vulnerable households facing higher energy costs.","WASHINGTON, Oct. 15 — Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) today led 31 senators in calling on the Trump administration to immediately restore the Solar for All program — a landmark initiative Sanders wrote to help working class families afford rooftop and community-based solar energy.

In a letter to Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Lee Zeldin, Sanders and his colleagues condemned the administration’s decision to cancel $7 billion in Solar for All funding in August. The program would have created tens of thousands of good-paying jobs in communities across the country, lowered residential electricity bills by at least 20% for more than 900,000 households and saved working families more than $8.7 billion in electric costs over the lifetime of the panels.

Joining Sanders as cosigners on the letter are Sens. Michael Bennet (D-Colo.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Lisa Blunt Rochester (D-Del.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.), John Hickenlooper (D-Colo.), Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii), Tim Kaine (D-Va.), Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.), Andy Kim (D-N.J.), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Ben Ray Lujan (D-N.M.), Ed Markey (D-Mass.), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), Patty Murray (D-Wash.), Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), Gary Peters (D-Mich.), Jack Reed (D-R.I.), Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H), Tina Smith (D-Minn.), Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), Mark Warner (D-Va.), Raphael Warnock (D-Ga.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Peter Welch (D-Vt.) and Ron Wyden (D-Ore.).

“Your agency’s decision to terminate Solar for All is not only unlawful — given this funding was congressionally appropriated and fully obligated — but also ill-timed. Energy bills are soaring across the country and millions of families are facing higher living costs. Indeed, electricity bills are 6.2 percent higher than this time last year, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics,” Sanders and the senators wrote. “EPA’s reckless decision to terminate Solar for All directly undermines efforts by Congress to reduce energy costs and improve grid resilience. It jeopardizes economic investments and inflicts severe job losses across the country while undermining the trust and financial certainty that communities, businesses, and local governments have placed in the federal government. Further, it disrupts workforce training initiatives, such as those in West Virginia, Alaska and across the Midwest where solar career pathways and apprenticeship programs are already underway.”

Sanders wrote and passed into law the Solar for All program to slash utility bills, promote clean energy job training and invest in American manufacturing. Vermont was slated to receive more than $62 million to help households install residential solar systems through the initiative.

“The EPA’s illegal termination of Solar for All has left states, communities, and businesses across the country in limbo, with critical projects stalled and vulnerable households facing higher energy costs. We demand the EPA immediately reinstate the Solar for All program, rectify the damage caused by this termination, and ensure grantees can proceed with the swift implementation of residential solar projects to slash utility bills and create many thousands of good jobs. In the meantime, we require a full accounting of how the EPA will rectify the damage caused by this program’s disruptive termination,” Sanders and the senators concluded. “The American people deserve transparency, accountability, and a government that honors its commitments.”",https://www.sanders.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/cropped-Shape-Map-VT-3-32x32.png,N,,2025-10-15 16:10:17.452307

The PV project will power nearly 600 low-income households, a local park district and a commercial business.

Located on Highway 20, the project features 12,000 solar panels spanning 26 acres, with a capacity of just under 5 MW. The project was supported by the Illinois Shines program with an $8.7 million in a renewable energy credit contract.

“Illinois has one of the most ambitious clean energy efforts in the entire nation, and we’re building our future around projects like the Highway 20 Community Solar Farm to accelerate the clean energy transition, revitalize communities and create new jobs,” said Gov. JB Pritzker. “In Illinois, we’ve incentivized tens of billions of dollars in private investment in renewable and clean energy development. At a time when energy prices are skyrocketing in part due to federal cuts and putting a real strain on working families, it is more important than ever to invest in cheaper, cleaner energy alternatives.”

Nautilus Solar Energy, the community solar developer behind the Highway 20 project, has relocated its headquarters to Chicago. The company expects to add 100 MW of new solar capacity in Illinois in 2026, building on its current portfolio of nearly 150 community solar farms across 12 states, serving more than 45,000 subscribers. ​

,Clean Energy ,2025-10-15 18:57:48+00:00,Mass.gov,Healey-Driscoll Administration Launches Redesigned Solar Incentive Program to Advance ...,Not Available,,,,,https://www.mass.gov/news/healey-driscoll-administration-launches-redesigned-solar-incentive-program-to-advance-solar-energy-in-massachusetts,"Boston — Today, the Healey-Driscoll Administration opened Massachusetts’ updated solar incentive program, Solar Massachusetts Renewable Target 3.0 (SMART).
SMART 3.0 is a sustainable incentive program that will advance solar energy development in Massachusetts while being able to quickly respond to changing market conditions.
This will allow DOER to adjust certain program components in response to project development, economic drivers, and overall program costs.
With its previous solar incentive programs, Massachusetts built a nation-leading solar industry, creating thousands of jobs and hundreds of businesses.
The redesigned SMART program is part of a broader initiative by the Healey-Driscoll Administration to lower energy bills for residents and businesses, and to bring more energy into Massachusetts.","Boston — Today, the Healey-Driscoll Administration opened Massachusetts’ updated solar incentive program, Solar Massachusetts Renewable Target 3.0 (SMART). The newly redesigned program was released in June on an emergency basis ahead of the Trump Administration’s rollbacks of bipartisan solar tax credits to help bring more low-cost energy supply into Massachusetts. The incentive program is expected to reduce electricity costs by $300 million next year and will make it easier for companies to invest in Massachusetts.

“To drive down costs, we need more energy - and solar is the fastest, cheapest energy we can bring into Massachusetts” said Governor Maura Healey. “Massachusetts is open for solar business – applications open today.”

“Solar is a homegrown Massachusetts industry,” said Lieutenant Governor Kim Driscoll. “Thousands of our residents rely on solar for their livelihood and to power their homes. We’re ramping up our solar programs to get solar built affordably and in the areas of the state that need it the most.”

“On hot days and cold days, solar is keeping the lights on and powering our businesses. Solar is low-cost energy we can bring online quickly, and it plays a vital role in the reliability of our electric grid,” said Energy and Environmental Affairs Secretary Rebecca Tepper. “With SMART 3.0, we are revitalizing a successful program to lower costs for customers and boost our economy.”

“We are actively working to produce more homegrown clean energy, and strengthening our ability to build more solar is key to that. SMART 3.0 is agile and will respond to rapidly changing market conditions, provide our solar industry with stability, and keep residents employed,” said Energy Resources Commissioner Elizabeth Mahony. “This is how we lower costs for our residents and businesses and provide our region with ample, reliable power.”

DOER will begin accepting applications for the updated SMART program today. The program opening follows updated regulations that became effective on June 20, 2025 and were finalized on September 12, 2025. Program Year 2025 will offer 900 MW of available capacity in an effort to maximize projects that can participate in the SMART 3.0 program and take advantage of the federal Investment Tax Credit. This will lower costs for ratepayers and help to quickly add more locally generated to Massachusetts.

SMART 3.0 is a sustainable incentive program that will advance solar energy development in Massachusetts while being able to quickly respond to changing market conditions. The program provides a flat incentive rate for residential customers and enhanced incentive offerings for low-income households. SMART 3.0 includes strong consumer protection provisions to ensure best practices by solar installers, which will result in fair contracts and meaningful savings for consumers.

The program also takes an innovative approach to land use policy by establishing a mitigation fund that will collect dollars from large solar installations and use those funds to invest in conservation, biodiversity, and other programs targeted at protecting Massachusetts’ natural landscapes to offset the impacts of solar infrastructure. SMART 3.0 provides added incentives for canopy projects and those installed on landfills and brownfields, prioritizing projects in the built environment. The updated program uses a mechanism to respond to market change annually through robust economic analysis. This will allow DOER to adjust certain program components in response to project development, economic drivers, and overall program costs.

The updates increase equity in the SMART program. In addition to a higher incentive rate for low-income households, those customers can qualify through participation in other needs-based programs or through self-attestation. All community solar projects are required to enroll a minimum of 40% low-income customers. A minimum discount on community solar bill credits for low-income customers is also required. SMART 3.0 expands the low-income property definition to include homeless shelters, deed-restricted condos, and properties enrolled in other housing assistance programs. It also supports affordable housing. For every $1.00 of SMART incentive, there are $2.64 in additional financial benefits to affordable housing properties.

With its previous solar incentive programs, Massachusetts built a nation-leading solar industry, creating thousands of jobs and hundreds of businesses. Under DOER’s solar programs, more than 140,000 solar projects, representing more than 4 gigawatts DC of clean energy, have been installed in Massachusetts. This solar deployment has transformed how the New England electric grid operates, helping to keep the lights on and lowering prices for ratepayers.

Solar reduces the need to build transmission and distribution infrastructure, saving hundreds of millions – if not billions – of dollars that ratepayers would otherwise pay to maintain system reliability. During the summer, solar helps reduce peak demand and lowers energy costs and grid investment needs. During the winter, solar production helps avoid the use of scarce fossil fuel resources by other electric generators, which improves system reliability and lowers energy prices for all customers. And during the spring and fall, solar can provide a significant portion of the region’s energy needs and reduce the wholesale costs of energy for everyone. For example, during the afternoon of April 20, 2025, over 55% of the electricity demand on the New England electric grid was met by distributed solar facilities. Demand on the electric grid that afternoon reached an all-time low.

The redesigned SMART program is part of a broader initiative by the Healey-Driscoll Administration to lower energy bills for residents and businesses, and to bring more energy into Massachusetts. In March, Governor Healey announced the Administration’s Energy Affordability Agenda to identify and advance actions to lower energy bills, which will save about $6 billion over five years. In May, Governor Healey filed the Energy Affordability, Independence & Innovation Act, which will get charges off bills and bring more energy into the state. To drive more solar development, the legislation equips the state with a more authority to procure energy resources like solar and secure the best price as market conditions evolve, while still reducing ratepayer net metering costs. An independent analysis of the bill’s savings found it could save customers over $13 billion. On September 29, Governor Healey hosted a Solar Summit to convene solar developers, trade associations, and labor and policy leaders to identify actions Massachusetts can take to harness the potential of solar to lower costs and attract investment. And yesterday, the Governor called on the DPU to launch the first-ever comprehensive review to lower gas and electric costs.

“The decision to terminate the DOE’s agreement with ARCHES is not only in clear violation of its grant agreement, but profoundly shortsighted,” wrote the lawmakers.","Washington, D.C. — Following the Trump administration’s decision to illegally cancel roughly $8 billion of federal funding for clean energy projects, including $1.2 billion for the Alliance for Renewable Clean Hydrogen Energy Systems (ARCHES) Hydrogen Hub, Rep. Dave Min, along with Representatives Mike Levin and George Whitesides, led the full California Democratic delegation in a letter to Energy Secretary Chris Wright condemning the Department of Energy’s (DOE) cut to ARCHES, and demanding the funding be restored.

California’s regional hydrogen hub was projected to create hundreds of thousands of new jobs throughout the state, drive cutting-edge technological innovation, and help the United States maintain its domestic energy dominance, all while reducing rising energy costs and improving air quality for millions of California residents.

“We know that the economy of the future will be based on cheap and plentiful renewable energies,” said Rep.

“The decision to terminate the DOE’s agreement with ARCHES is not only in clear violation of its grant agreement, but profoundly shortsighted,” wrote the lawmakers. “Data centers and artificial intelligence are driving an aggressive demand for new sources of power, and countries that innovate to overcome these bottlenecks will lead the 21st - century economy. This administration cannot be pulling the plug on an American industry and crushing domestic innovation as China races ahead, pouring billions of dollars into its own energy sector.”

They continued, “This unlawful action is all the more alarming considering that ARCHES has demonstrated significant progress and remains a success story in the regional hydrogen hub program. Terminating the grant agreement will kneecap a major economic driver for the State of California—as ARCHES is projected to create over 200,000 jobs—while also harming local economies in Republican and Democratic states alike. The hub is already driving further demand to invest in and build new factories throughout the United States, with many ARCHES projects placing purchase orders or leveraging existing manufacturing facilities in states like Alabama, Arizona, Georgia, Texas, and others.”

The representatives are demanding answers as to the legal justification for the cancellation of these grants by October 29, 2025.

Vice President Kashim Shettima announced this at the inaugural Nigerian Renewable Energy Innovation Forum (NREIF) 2025 in Abuja on Tuesday, reports The Nation.
He assured investors and development partners of the administration’s commitment to policy reforms that de-risk private investment, promote local manufacturing, and strengthen the renewable energy value chain.
“We are enhancing incentives for local manufacturing, streamlining regulatory frameworks, and deepening collaboration with state governments and investors to accelerate the emergence of a self-sustaining renewable energy market,” he added.
The Vice President also called on governors to promote renewable industrial clusters as engines of green growth across the country.","Nigeria is set to unlock over $400 million in new investments as part of its ambitious plan to become Africa’s hub for renewable energy. Vice President Kashim Shettima announced this at the inaugural Nigerian Renewable Energy Innovation Forum (NREIF) 2025 in Abuja on Tuesday, reports The Nation.

Speaking on behalf of President Bola Tinubu, Shettima said the country’s energy transition is being structured to attract major investments, expand access to electricity, and create a self-sustaining clean energy market to power homes, industries, and innovation nationwide.

According to the Vice President’s office, over $23 billion is needed to bridge Nigeria’s energy access gap and connect millions still living without reliable electricity, even as the administration targets a total installed capacity of 277 gigawatts by 2060.

“We are blessed with the minerals that power clean technologies, and Nigeria brings to the table youth, ambition, and untapped renewable potential. Let us seize this moment and affirm that Nigeria is ready to harness her resources, unlock her capital, and become the vibrant heartbeat of Africa’s renewable energy revolution,” Shettima said.

He assured investors and development partners of the administration’s commitment to policy reforms that de-risk private investment, promote local manufacturing, and strengthen the renewable energy value chain. “We are enhancing incentives for local manufacturing, streamlining regulatory frameworks, and deepening collaboration with state governments and investors to accelerate the emergence of a self-sustaining renewable energy market,” he added.

The Vice President highlighted the “Nigeria First” industrial strategy, which envisions localised renewable energy supply chains, from solar panel assembly plants in Lagos to battery recycling hubs across industrial corridors. This strategy aims to position Nigeria as a leader in Africa’s clean energy sector.

He announced that the forum had mobilised over $400 million in investment commitments, covering solar panels, smart meters, battery storage, and recycling facilities, expected to generate more than 1,500 direct jobs across several states. “The Ministry of Power is working on policies that will lay the foundation for a more decentralised, competitive, and inclusive electricity market,” Shettima said, urging development partners and Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) to localise technologies and invest in skills and knowledge transfer.

The Vice President also called on governors to promote renewable industrial clusters as engines of green growth across the country.

Minister of Power, Chief Adebayo Adelabu, described the forum as a new chapter in Nigeria’s energy transformation, highlighting the government’s commitment to large-scale local solar production and energy diversification. Mallam Abba Aliyu, Managing Director of the Rural Electrification Agency (REA), said NREIF bridges policy and research to accelerate Nigeria’s transition to a sustainable green energy ecosystem.

In a goodwill message, UN Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed, represented by UN Resident Coordinator Mohammed M. Malick Fall, pledged support for Nigeria’s renewable energy agenda, noting the forum reflects Africa’s determination to power homes, schools, and industries through clean energy.

The Dutch Ambassador to Nigeria, Bengt van Loosdrecht, also reaffirmed the Netherlands’ partnership with Nigeria in renewable energy, calling the forum “a milestone in the deepening of bilateral cooperation.”

During the event, Vice President Shettima, along with the governors of Jigawa, Bayelsa, and Ogun states, and representatives from REA and other agencies, signed several multi-million-dollar Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs) with private sector players and development partners, including the Dutch government, aimed at expanding Nigeria’s renewable energy manufacturing base.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Renewable-Energy-Solar.jpeg,N,,2025-10-15 18:11:30.518999

Community Standards

While A.I. data center facilities are critical to our modern economy, they often rely on powerful cooling systems, backup generators, and other industrial equipment that can cause significant disruptions for nearby residents, schools, and community spaces.

Currently, there are no consistent statewide standards that require data centers to mitigate these impacts. This gap leaves communities vulnerable to quality-of-life concerns when facilities are sited nearby.

For these reasons, we will be introducing legislation directing municipalities to regulate data centers and adopt local ordinances to limit harmful impacts on nearby communities.

These ordinances would include provisions for sound barriers, set back distances, building design standards, equipment modifications, and other measures to reduce community disruptions.

If data centers are going to be built in our neighborhoods, they must be sited and regulated with the well-being of nearby residents in mind.

This legislation will:

-- Protect the health and well-being of residents living near data centers.

-- Ensure responsible siting and operation of these facilities.

-- Support sustainable economic development that preserves community quality of life.

Water Use

A.I. data center facilities often consume substantial amounts of water, primarily for cooling. Larger data centers consume millions of gallons daily, on par with entire communities.

The impact of these massive withdrawals on local water supplies remains unclear, but one thing is certain: we must make sure that our residents, communities, and environment are not disproportionately affected.

New legislation would require covered data center projects with substantial water needs to proactively inform the state prior to construction.

This step will ensure that state agencies, in collaboration with local governments and river basin commissions, can assess potential impacts and ensure adequate considerations are in place to protect our water supplies.

Energy Efficiency

Data centers require an enormous amount of uninterrupted electricity to power computer servers, cooling systems, and supporting infrastructure.

While some companies are working to incorporate energy-efficient technologies, more must be done to mitigate the impacts on utility customers and Pennsylvania’s already strained energy grid.

New legislation will require data centers seeking the state sales tax exemptions to obtain recognized energy efficiency certifications, such as LEED, Energy Star, Green Globes, or International Organization for Standardization (ISO).

This proposal will ensure that only data centers meeting the highest efficiency standards can benefit from state tax incentives.

Data centers that achieved such certifications have seen lower operational costs, improved sustainability, and a stronger market reputation, creating a win-win situation for both businesses and communities.

With this proposal, we can incentivize data centers to operate sustainably, reduce electricity demands, and help meet Pennsylvania’s future energy needs. At the end of the day, the cleanest and cheapest energy is the energy we don’t use.

Transparency

Without clear reporting, it is difficult for policymakers to fully understand and mitigate impacts on ratepayers, the electric grid, local water supplies, and our environment.

New legislation would require data center developers and end users to disclose the nature of their operations and report energy and water usage to the Department of Conservation and Natural Resources (DCNR).

Based on this reporting, DCNR would prepare an impact report and make recommendations to the General Assembly on how to address any environmental concerns posed by data centers.

These transparency measures will play a crucial role in protecting our residents, informing sound policy decisions, and safeguarding natural resources for future generations.

Appropriate guardrails can only be applied to this growing industry if residents and policymakers alike have an unrestricted view into data center development and operation.

Emergency Preparedness

The high-density layout of computing and storage equipment could lead to fast-spreading fires.

The consequences of a data center fire extend beyond service interruptions, loss of data, and threats to facilities; fires of this type pose special hazards to firefighters and other first responders.

Data centers are huge buildings with complex floor plans, ultra-secure perimeters, and high-value equipment that reacts poorly to water.

As such, fighting fires at data centers require specialized training, planning, and cooperation between firefighters and on-site staff such as security and engineering personnel.

New legislation would assist local governments and fire departments in the event of this type of emergency, including requiring data centers to meet the National Fire Protection Association’s standards for energy storage facilities, updated fire plans and coordination with local government and emergency response agencies.

Data center fires are rare. Nonetheless, it is our responsibility to give those on the ground all the tools they need to quickly and safely extinguish data center fires.

Click Here for the co-sponsor memo.

Prevailing Wage

Under Act 25 of 2021, purchases of computer data center equipment are exempt from the Pennsylvania sales and use tax.

While these exemptions are intended to encourage private investment, there are no eligibility requirements that guarantee family-sustaining wages for the men and women who build these facilities.

As a result, public dollars may indirectly subsidize low-wage or out-of-state contractors at the expense of our skilled local workforce.

New legislation would require data center developers to pay the prevailing wage on all construction projects to remain eligible for the state sales tax exemption.

This reform strikes a balance: developers would still have access to incentives to grow in our state, while workers would be protected with fair wages that reflect the going rate in their trades and regions.

A Wisconsin Examiner piece published Monday highlights the continued costs of the Trump administration’s vendetta against clean energy

Madison, WI – As Semafor recently reported, the Trump administration is considering cutting an additional $12 billion worth of clean energy projects, including $130 million worth of projects based in Wisconsin. A piece published Monday in the Wisconsin Examiner highlighted how these potential cuts threaten Wisconsin’s burgeoning clean energy industry, leading to lost jobs and even higher utility bills for Wisconsinites.

Key quotes from the Wisconsin Examiner piece include:

“These [investments] are all win-win that all of us want regardless of our political affiliation. This is all bottom-line stuff…[Cuts] mean[s] higher electric bills, higher energy bills, fewer choices and lost jobs. We’re going to lose momentum.” – John Imes, director of the Wisconsin Environmental Initiative

“We’re trying to make our energy systems more efficient and better so everybody’s paying less for energy…“Everything we’re doing is trying to make buildings and homes more affordable to live in with lower utility bills. If we’re not able to do that, that’s also a cost to people in Wisconsin.” – Scott Hackel, Slipstream’s vice president for research

“Collateral damage from the Trump administration’s remarkably poor governance record continues to collect, this time in Kaukauna. I can’t think of something more insulting than making the electric grid of a place known as ‘Electric City’ less safe or efficient.” – Outagamie County Executive Tom Nelson

“They’re just trying to roll back a lot of the green energy and infrastructure [investments]. … It’s trying to make time stand still, and it just won’t if the United States is going to compete globally…It’s not just taking money away and eliminating classes. It’s eliminating opportunities and a chance for generational change for people who really need it.” – Dan Bukiewicz, head of the Milwaukee Building Trades Council

Expanded use of fossil fuels, however, will result in a faster climb in total power generation from now through 2040 compared to 2022’s projections, which contained a steep drop-off in estimated coal-fired output over the coming years.

COAL’S LONGER LIFE

North American power generation by fossil fuel power sources from 2025 to 2050 will grow by around 8% compared to DNV’s 2022 estimates, due mainly to the Trump administration’s stated expansions to coal and gas-fired power.

Coal-fired power generation from now through 2050 is projected to be 46% more than was estimated by DNV in 2022, following the Trump administration’s new policies that will extend the life of U.S. coal power plants by several years.

North American gas-fired generation through 2050 will grow by around 5% from DNV’s 2022 estimate, due in large part to expectations that new gas capacity will be developed over the coming decade in response to gas-friendly policies in the U.S.

WIND WOES

Generation from clean power sources during 2025 to 2050 will decline by around 3% from 2022’s estimates, again due to U.S. policy changes that have resulted in sharp drops to federal incentives for clean power deployment.

Total power generation from wind farms in North America is estimated to fall by around 24% from DNV’s 2022 estimate, following the aggressive slashing of U.S. federal support for wind development since President Trump returned to office.

Power generation from solar photovoltaic installations is also expected to shrink compared to 2022’s estimates due to the Trump policy u-turn, although only by 5%.

Steady declines in solar system costs, coupled with the fact that solar systems remain the fastest source of new electricity for grid managers, are expected to keep solar capacity growth relatively firm despite the policy shifts.

Continued federal support for battery systems going forward is expected to result in a 71% surge in generation from solar-plus-storage systems compared to DNV’s 2022 estimates.

Sharply lower battery costs compared to 2022 are another factor driving expected solar-plus-storage uptake compared to 2022.

EMISSIONS IMPACT

In its 2022 outlook for global energy generation and emissions, DNV estimated that North America’s power emissions after carbon capture sequestration and storage were likely to steadily decline from around 1.2 billion tons of CO2 a year in the 2020s to around 360 million tons a year by the 2040s.

In its 2025 report, however, those emissions estimates veer higher for the next decade or so due to the extension of coal use within the United States, and average around 100 million tons of CO2 more than the 2022 emissions estimates.

Emissions from coal-fired generation had been projected to average around 310 million tons of CO2 a year through 2035 in the DNV 2022 report.

In this year’s report, coal-fired emissions are seen averaging around 470 million tons a year through 2035, which marks a more than a 50% increase.

Between 2025 and 2050, that sustained higher level of coal-fired generation is expected to result in 2.6 billion tons of CO2 more than was projected in 2022, and around 3.2 billion tons more of total power sector emissions.

To justify the extended use of coal plants, the Trump administration has argued that rapidly rising electricity demand from data centres and other businesses could result in potential power shortages unless output from fossil fuel plants increased.

And it is clear from DNV’s generation projections that total power output in North America will rise faster through 2040 under the current administration’s policy scenario than under the policies that governed DNV’s projections in 2022.

A major takeaway, however, is that the higher generation peak comes with a sharp rise in power emissions that could be avoided if a cleaner power mix was deployed instead.

The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.

The company noted that the loss is part of its plan to realign EV production and factory operations to better match customer demand.
The decision was made after the expiration of the $7,500 federal EV tax credit on Sept. 30, part of a broader policy rollback under President Trump.
GM said the Chevrolet Equinox EV was the best-selling electric model outside Tesla, while its Cadillac Lyriq, Optiq, and Vistiq models all ranked among the top 10 in U.S. EV sales.

The Detroit-based automaker said its Audit Committee approved the loss on Oct. 7, covering the three months ended Sept. 30.

The company noted that the loss is part of its plan to realign EV production and factory operations to better match customer demand.

The decision was made after the expiration of the $7,500 federal EV tax credit on Sept. 30, part of a broader policy rollback under President Trump.

The credit, officially started under the Energy Improvement and Extension Act of 2008, revised under The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, and expanded under former President Biden’s 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, had been a key driver of EV sales in the United States. Trump signed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act on July 4, which set Sept. 30 as the final date for receiving EV purchase credits, effectively terminating the benefit.

“Following recent U.S. government policy changes, including the termination of certain consumer tax incentives for EV purchases and the reduction in the stringency of emissions regulations, we expect the adoption rate of EVs to slow,” GM said in a filing.

GM shares fell 2.5% in premarket trading, but have rebounded since as the broad market recovered...

As Evgenia Filimianova details below for The Epoch Times, according to the filing, $1.2 billion of the loss is related to non-cash impairments, mostly write-downs of EV assets.

The remaining $400 million will be paid in cash for contract cancellations and commercial settlements tied to EV investments.

The company said its review of EV manufacturing and battery component investments is ongoing.

“It is reasonably possible that we will recognize additional future material cash and non-cash charges that may adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows in the period in which they are recognized,” GM added.

GM noted that the costs, along with several smaller ones this quarter, will be recorded as adjustments in its non-GAAP results, which exclude one-time items from the company’s official earnings reported under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).

The automaker also said its EV realignment will not affect current Chevrolet, GMC, and Cadillac electric models, which “remain available to consumers.”

Industry Changes

GM had previously pledged to invest up to $35 billion in electric and autonomous vehicles through 2025, aiming to transition most of its portfolio to zero-emission models later in the decade.

However, slower-than-expected consumer adoption, high production costs, and uncertain government policy have made that goal more difficult to achieve.

GM joins other automakers reassessing the EV market, including rival Ford Motor Co. Last year, Ford said it would take a $1.9 billion hit from plans that included canceling an all-electric SUV and delaying an electric pickup truck.

Despite the planned cutbacks, GM said this month that its overall sales remain strong. The automaker reported total U.S. vehicle sales of 2.2 million through the first three quarters of 2025, its fastest pace in a decade.

GM said the Chevrolet Equinox EV was the best-selling electric model outside Tesla, while its Cadillac Lyriq, Optiq, and Vistiq models all ranked among the top 10 in U.S. EV sales.

Analysts have said that the end of the federal EV tax credit “will test whether the electric vehicle market is mature enough to thrive on its own fundamentals or still needs support to expand further.”

In a Sept. 2 report, Duncan Aldred, GM’s North America president, said the company expects lower EV sales next quarter after the tax credits end on Sept. 30. He added that it may take a few months for the market to steady.

“Still, we believe GM can continue to grow EV market share,” he wrote. “We are seeing marginal competitors dramatically scale back their products and plans, which should end much of the overproduction and irrational discounts we’ve seen in the marketplace.”

""It is reasonably possible that we will recognize additional future material cash and non-cash charges that may adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows in the period in which they are recognized,"" GM added.

GM noted that the costs, along with several smaller ones this quarter, will be recorded as adjustments in its non-GAAP results, which exclude one-time items from the company's official earnings reported under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).

The automaker also said its EV realignment will not affect current Chevrolet, GMC, and Cadillac electric models, which ""remain available to consumers.""

Industry Changes

GM had previously pledged to invest up to $35 billion in electric and autonomous vehicles through 2025, aiming to transition most of its portfolio to zero-emission models later in the decade.

However, slower-than-expected consumer adoption, high production costs, and uncertain government policy have made that goal more difficult to achieve.

GM joins other automakers reassessing the EV market, including rival Ford Motor Co. Last year, Ford said it would take a $1.9 billion hit from plans that included canceling an all-electric SUV and delaying an electric pickup truck.

Despite the planned cutbacks, GM said this month that its overall sales remain strong. The automaker reported total U.S. vehicle sales of 2.2 million through the first three quarters of 2025, its fastest pace in a decade.

GM said the Chevrolet Equinox EV was the best-selling electric model outside Tesla, while its Cadillac Lyriq, Optiq, and Vistiq models all ranked among the top 10 in U.S. EV sales.

Analysts have said that the end of the federal EV tax credit ""will test whether the electric vehicle market is mature enough to thrive on its own fundamentals or still needs support to expand further.""

In a Sept. 2 report, Duncan Aldred, GM's North America president, said the company expects lower EV sales next quarter after the tax credits end on Sept. 30. He added that it may take a few months for the market to steady.

""Still, we believe GM can continue to grow EV market share,"" he wrote. ""We are seeing marginal competitors dramatically scale back their products and plans, which should end much of the overproduction and irrational discounts we've seen in the marketplace.""

On the gap-filling and thermal interface front, H.B.","Effective thermal management is one of the most critical aspects of EV battery pack design. Engineers must not only ensure efficient heat dissipation during charging and discharging cycles but also maintain uniform temperature across all cells to optimize performance and extend battery life. This requires integrating advanced materials—such as flame-retardant foams, adhesives, and gap fillers—that can simultaneously control heat flow, provide structural reinforcement, and improve overall safety.

To learn more about addressing these thermal challenges at the material level, Charged recently chatted with Germaine Mariaselvaraj, Technical Service Manager at H.B. Fuller. Germaine explained how their EV Protect foam series addresses a core challenge in EV battery design: preventing thermal runaway from propagating between cells. The foam acts as a fire‐retardant barrier, helping isolate a single failing cell so that the rest of the pack remains intact. Beyond just safety, it also delivers structural and vibration-resistance benefits, which many battery integrators rely on to meet durability standards without adding heavy metal or plastic stiffeners.

H.B. Fuller’s first offering, EV Protect 4006, is a semi-structural foam that flows into cavities and expands to encapsulate components. As market demands shifted toward more structural solutions, H.B. Fuller introduced EV Protect 5006, 5008, and 5009—versions with increased stiffness that allow for the reduction or replacement of traditional structural parts. The upshot: reduced part count, lower mass and a more integrated pack layout that supports newer architectures like cell-to-pack or cell-to-chassis.

Beyond thermal management, the foam contributes to noise, vibration and harshness (NVH) control and thermal insulation. Some customers rely on the foam to help them pass vibration testing that they could not achieve with bare components, and because the foam envelops the cells, it also mitigates temperature swings in extreme ambient conditions. In cold or hot environments, the foam moderates local temperatures, helping reduce the impact on range or battery performance.

Germaine also discussed H.B. Fuller’s EV Bond 775, a reactive hot-melt adhesive that streamlines battery module assembly. By replacing tape or multi-step adhesive processes, this reactive hot-melt enables faster bonding of mica to lids, cells and cooling tubes. That accelerates cycle time, reduces handling, and cuts scrap or rework—all valuable in high-volume battery manufacturing.

On the gap-filling and thermal interface front, H.B. Fuller’s EV Them 288 (a silicone-free MS polymer) competes with traditional silicone gap fillers. Because it’s silicone-free, it helps meet stricter OEM constraints on materials in the manufacturing environment.",https://chargedevs.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/HB-Fuller-Final.jpg,N,,2025-10-15 15:11:00.136317

Electric Era claims that it can complete an entire installation in 54 days.","Electric Era has unveiled its latest battery-backed DC fast-charger, which use LFP cells to buffer how much energy draw is needed from the grid.

Called RetailEdge, these next-gen chargers have a slim design with a 27-inch touchscreen that includes an AI-assisted interface. They can self-diagnose and address software errors that most often take down chargers.

The Seattle-based startup not only sells its fast-chargers to retailers, but it also installs and services the stations, with first deliveries slated for later next year.

Many EV owners have been there. With their battery's state of charge getting low, they pull into an unoccupied stall at a public DC fast-charger only to find that it's not working. It's a frustrating feeling that's unfortunately more common than it should be as the number of registered electric vehicles continues to grow. Perhaps surprisingly, the problem usually isn't caused by faulty hardware but rather a software issue, according to Electric Era CEO Quincy Lee. Luckily, his company's newly unveiled fast-chargers can self-diagnose and fix those glitches ASAP, which should make its retail-focused public chargers more reliable.

A New Era of Public Charging

Haven't heard of Electric Era? The Seattle-based startup was founded in 2020, and its first charging stations went live in late 2022. Currently, it claims 130 stalls in 13 states, but EE is different from, say, Electrify America or Tesla's Supercharger network. Unlike those forward-facing brands, Electric Era calls itself a ""solutions provider,"" as it's basically a one-stop shop for retailers such as Costco to buy fast-chargers and have them installed and maintained without dealing with a middleman. And that's where EE's next-generation chargers, coined RetailEdge, come into play, as they're now available to order and aim to make the user experience more effortless than frustrating.

A charger that works is obviously less frustrating than one that doesn't, and Electric Era claims an uptime rate of 99.8 percent per port. The fast-chargers also feature an innovative battery-backed platform that's said to help with reliability and reduce operating costs by up to 70 percent versus traditional chargers. The lithium-iron-phosphate (LFP) battery cells are similar to EV batteries, with EE packs providing 220- or 379-kWh capacities. The other bonus of using standalone batteries is that it reduces the peak energy draw from the grid, not to mention these stations take less time to install by avoiding major upgrades to electric infrastructure. Electric Era claims that it can complete an entire installation in 54 days.

The new RetailEdge kiosks are attractive—for an EV charger, anyway—and retailers have countless branding options. Along with CCS-type and NACS plugs, the chargers have a sleek design that EE claims is dramatically slimmer than their predecessors. And each unit includes a 27-inch display that responds to touch and voice inputs. The customizable interface also allows people to tap-to-pay, and it incorporates a ""HaloAI"" assistant to help rookies and veterans alike understand what they're doing as well as troubleshoot any problems.

And that brings us back to the common problem among public fast-chargers: reliability. Electric Era appears to have an effective strategy, with its vertically integrated chargers able to operate on a local real-time control loop and autonomously address repair faults, so no waiting for a human to arrive on the scene. ""We engineered our systems to detect and correct errors on our chargers before the customer even sees them,"" said Lee, who previously worked for Starlink, a satellite internet service developed by SpaceX. With these new fast-chargers, customers will also have the option to add a Starlink-based connection for an extra layer of reliability.

Electric Era hasn't yet announced any commercial partnerships, but it did say that the first deliveries of its RetailEdge chargers should take place sometime in the second half of next year.

""Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is a critical part of maintaining and growing the manufacturing industry in our state.
Those concerns led to a push in the most recent legislative session to block or restrict carbon capture.","Gov. Jeff Landry declared a moratorium Wednesday on new applications for carbon capture injection wells in Louisiana and wants state regulators to prioritize review of the more than 30 applications already before them.

Landry's order calls for companies to make more effort to seek out public and local government input on pending projects. That tracks recent changes in state law and new internal policies in Landry's administration.

Landry also said the state Department of Conservation and Energy is creating a new priority list for existing carbon capture projects. Companies will be required to take a number of steps before their projects can get on the list.

In a 12-page executive order, Landry says the changes are happening ""to provide a clear roadmap for citizens and local officials,"" to create transparency for the public and to recognize the reality of the intensive time required to review each project — an estimated 2,000 hours.

""Local government and citizens, through their local government, have a right to be heard to ensure safety, transparency, and local input,"" part of the preamble to the governor's order says.

The department has also already prioritized six projects among the more than 30 due to the economic impact and lack of old wells and other routes that could provide a path for leaking CO2.

Carbon capture and sequestration involves pumping carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases produced from industrial processes deep underground, compressed to a near-liquid state. The chemicals would be stored there permanently.

Industry, LSU scientists and other sources argue Louisiana's sedimentary geology is prime to safely use the technology.

The technology, however, has recently sparked opposition in conservative-leaning rural Louisiana, which typically is supportive of oil and gas and new industries. It has also drawn criticism from the state's more left-leaning environmental justice movement.

They worry about storing waste carbon dioxide under tens of thousands of acres of farm and pasture land, country estates, and timber properties.

Though Landry calls on state departments to work together, the order has the potential to slow an oil, gas and petrochemical industry push to find carbon storage sites across Louisiana and make the state's fossil fuel-heavy industries more competitive in foreign markets worried about climate change.

The order sparked an immediate response from the Louisiana Chemical Association, a major trade group for big manufacturers in the Mississippi River corridor and elsewhere in the state.

David Cresson, president and CEO of the group, said the association appreciated Landry's ""focus on public safety, environmental stewardship, and economic growth"" but was troubled by the new order that, Cresson said, could undermine the efficiency that gaining state primacy over carbon capture applications in 2024 had promised.

Primacy allowed the state to take over final approval of carbon capture projects from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in hopes of speeding along the process.

Cresson noted LCA members have already invested $60 billion in Louisiana projects that depend on carbon capture and storage, but the ""conditional moratorium"" sends ""the wrong message to the market at a pivotal moment for Louisiana’s economy.""

""Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is a critical part of maintaining and growing the manufacturing industry in our state. A pause on applications, regardless of the reasoning, signals uncertainty for projects that enable lower-emissions production, support thousands of high-wage jobs, and encourage future reinvestment,"" Cresson said.

Concerns from critics of carbon capture revolve around a mix of issues: land rights; the impact on underground aquifers if CO2 leaks; skepticism of climate change; skepticism of its effectiveness in fully capturing CO2; and the use of federal money to finance the effort.

Those concerns led to a push in the most recent legislative session to block or restrict carbon capture. Though most of those bills failed, one requiring the state give substantial consideration to local officials' concerns has triggered new directives within the state Department of Conservation and Energy.

The order also says other recent changes on land acquisition for CO2 pipelines and creating carbon storage areas would constitute a new ""landowner bill of rights"" that should guide government decision-making on new carbon capture projects.

Those new laws make it harder for pipeline companies to gain land expropriation power for CO2 pipelines, increase public notice requirements about expropriation plans and raise the percentage of landowners who must agree—from 75% to 85%—before a region, or ""unit,"" can be set aside for underground CO2 storage.

Since gaining primacy in early 2024, the state, through its Department of Conservation and Energy, has been asked to review 33 projects with more than 100 wells. But it had approved only one in early September.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/theadvocate.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/f/b4/fb4caceb-03aa-4185-86fd-8643dee46d37/68bf40fdb65dd.image.jpg?crop=1763%2C926%2C0%2C124&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2025-10-15 16:11:30.947264

To be more precise, I warned the automakers to slow their roll dumping billions into electric cars when there was no evidence Americans wanted them.

So, when General Motors announced this week that it would take a $1.6 billion write-off tied to its electric vehicle investments, it wasn’t just a financial footnote. It was a huge red flag. GM said about $1.2 billion of that is a non-cash impairment on manufacturing capacity, and another $400 million covers canceled supplier contracts and other costs. This isn’t a minor accounting adjustment; it’s a course correction. Behind the numbers lies a story of ambition colliding with reality.

GM’S $1.6 BILLION DOLLAR LOSS ON EVS—IN PERSPECTIVE

If you had $1.6 billion, you could buy:

• Roughly 22,000 brand-new Chevrolet Silverado pickups—even if each one stickered at $70,000.

• About 30,000 Cadillac LYRIQs, GM’s own electric SUV that costs around $55,000.

• Every single Corvette built this year—and still have money left over for a private jet to park next to them.

• A small NFL franchise, like the Cincinnati Bengals or Jacksonville Jaguars were valued not long ago.

• Half of the Detroit Tigers, or most of an NHL team.

• Ten years of NASCAR sponsorship at a top-tier team.

• A brand-new assembly plant and still have several hundred million left for R&D.

• Around 40 million barrels of oil—which is more than the U.S. burns in two days.

• Or, as a reminder of scale, enough to buy a fleet of 40 Gulfstream G700 jets or an entire year’s production of Lucid Airs at current sales rates.

In the regulatory filing this week, GM went on to say:

“The reassessment of our EV capacity and manufacturing footprint, including our investments in our battery component manufacturing, is ongoing, and it is reasonably possible that we will recognize additional future material cash and non-cash charges that may adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows in the period in which they are recognized.”

(Translated: There are going to be more losses, we just don’t know how big a bloodbath it is yet.)

Stop The Insanity!

Way back in 2017, I wrote a column titled “Stop the Electric Car Insanity,” where I warned automakers to slow down and let the market decide how fast consumers wanted to transition to electric vehicles. I raised concerns about range anxiety, charging infrastructure, battery recycling, and whether there would be enough demand to absorb a flood of EVs. Fast-forward eight years, and many of those challenges haven’t just lingered—they’ve grown.

GM’s loss makes that clear. The company blamed policy shifts, including the removal of the $7,500 federal EV tax credit and changes to emissions rules. That shouldn’t surprise anyone. The EV market has been heavily propped up by government incentives since day one, and when those fade, so does a big part of the buying motivation.

GM insists it’s not abandoning electric vehicles entirely. Chevrolet, GMC, and Cadillac will continue with their current EV lineups, but the company is reviewing its factory footprint and investment priorities. Translation: GM is hedging its all-electric bet. The shame here is that I’ve said many times on the Car Pro Show that currently, GM was producing the very best EVs on the market.

I Warned Ford’s CEO As Well

This moment reminds me of what I told Ford CEO Jim Farley in my open letter last year. Ford had just admitted it was losing roughly $100,000 on every EV it sold. I said then—and it holds true now—that building a product the public isn’t asking for is not leadership. It’s gambling. I urged him to “dance with the one that brung you”—to remember that Ford’s profitability and brand loyalty were built on trucks, SUVs, and performance cars that people actually want. The same message now applies to GM.

What frustrates me most is how little the industry seems to have learned. Back when automakers were chasing Tesla’s shadow, I said they were sprinting into the future without checking the fuel gauge. Building dozens of EV models before the public truly demanded them was always going to create a glut. It’s basic economics: supply without demand equals losses, and the losses per vehicle were mind-boggling.

So Many Questions Still Unanswered

The same pain points remain. Charging stations are still too few and too unreliable in much of the country. Battery degradation and recycling are still big question marks. Depreciation is brutal—many EVs lose staggering amounts of value after the first year, which is why I tell listeners to LEASE, not purchase, EVs. And outside of early adopters, consumers are hesitant to pay a premium for a product that feels like it’s still in beta testing.

GM’s reversal shows that even the biggest names can get swept up in the wave of optimism that electric cars would take over faster than they have. Reality is different. Buyers still want trucks and SUVs with long range, fast refueling, and affordable price tags. GM’s move back toward hybrids and efficient gas models isn’t regression—it’s realism.

This isn’t the end of electric vehicles. It’s a reset. The industry is realizing that “all-electric by 2035” slogans make for good headlines but don’t always make business sense. Policy changes, consumer hesitation, and infrastructure gaps have turned what was supposed to be a straight road into a winding detour.

Will Automakers Learn From This?

For the auto industry, the lessons are clear: build capacity only when demand justifies it, don’t rely on endless subsidies, and remember that internal combustion and hybrid vehicles still have a long future ahead. The market—not regulators, not press releases—should set the pace. The sudden move toward hybrids by all automakers makes really good sense, I only wish they poured the billions of dollars into hybrids and plug-in hybrids instead of all-electric vehicles.

GM’s $1.6 billion loss is a reminder that even well-intentioned revolutions can get ahead of themselves. Electric vehicles are part of the future, but not the whole future. The goal should never be to push people into a product before they’re ready for it. It should be to make that product good enough—and affordable enough—that they want it on their own.

I’ve talked on air for a number of years about the future losses electric cars would cause. Not because of the cars themselves, but because automakers and our own government was shoving them down our throats. General Motors was the first to fess up to jumping the gun, but there are many more billions of dollars in red ink coming. Who knows the full impact? I certainly don’t, but over 10 billion would not be a surprise. Keep in mind, there have already been billions of dollars of losses written off each quarter over the past decade. Let that sink in.

Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy – $1.69 billion","Last week, the U.S. Department of Energy pulled the plug on billions of dollars’ worth of funding designated for advanced manufacturing, grid modernization, community resiliency hubs, academic institutions, and various clean energy and efficiency initiatives. These cuts are in addition to 321 financial awards supporting 223 projects that were set adrift on October 2.

The implications are grave for domestic supply chain revitalization efforts and even more so for ratepayers. Major automakers will have to find another way to advance electric vehicle (EV) production, American companies will be forced to rely on foreign supply, and utilities must rethink how they’ll pay for desperately-needed updates to aging electric infrastructure.

Environmental group Sierra Club’s Jeremy Fisher has assembled a visualization of the latest DOE cuts and sorted them by funding office. The October 7 decision to cut about 600 infrastructure projects slashed roughly $15.5 billion total in federal spending, another $13.3 billion in matching state funds, and all but assured the wipeout of billions in corresponding private investments.

The Biggest Cuts and Who They Hurt Most

Major automakers and suppliers are facing the most painful project cuts, mostly targeted toward EV and battery manufacturing. Fiat Chrysler is losing out on $530 million in federal funding for EV factories in Illinois and Indiana. General Motors is forgoing $500 million for new electric motor factories in Michigan, Kansas, and Kentucky. Volvo ($208 million, North Carolina) and Harley-Davidson ($89 million, Pennsylvania) are also drawing short straws.

Grid modernization plans made by utilities and state commissions, both large and small, are on the DOE’s chopping block, including $630.6 million set to go to the California Energy Commission (CEC) for reconductoring more than 100 miles of transmission lines and building others, $464.5 million designated for Minnesota’s Department of Commerce to improve grid interconnection, and $249.1 million intended for the Georgia Environmental Finance Authority to address reliability and resiliency concerns in disadvantaged areas.

“These projects are critical not only to the communities and jobs that they serve, but are core to a robust supply chain to keep prices – and emissions – low for consumers and businesses. This kind of federal funding is the stuff that actually makes things work,” stated Fisher, Principal Advisor on climate and energy with the Sierra Club’s Environmental Law Program. “Investments in our economy drive new industries, drive American innovation, and keep our economy competitive. Slashing these programs is a relatively small short-term gain for a huge long-term loss.”

,Detroit and Evs,2025-10-15 17:28:31+00:00,Planet Detroit,VOICES: Why Detroit needs Complete Streets ordinance for quality of life,"Todd Scott, Charles Griffith, John Hartig, Alexander Rabin, Lisa DelBuono",,,,,https://planetdetroit.org/2025/10/complete-streets-detroit-safety/,"Detroit has made an investment in complete streets through its Complete Streets team, which has a designated staff and works regularly on projects that make it safe for people to share the road with cars and trucks.
But Detroit does not have a Complete Streets Ordinance, which would codify these policies and ensure the safety of everyone who uses the roads in our community.
Why does Detroit need Complete Streets?
Why do we need a Complete Streets ordinance?
Let’s work together to improve the quality of life and safety for everyone in our community through an honest and open discussion and work toward passing a Complete Streets Ordinance.","We all want and deserve to live in safe, healthy communities. Complete Streets policies make communities and neighborhoods more livable by ensuring all people can get safely to where they need to go — work, school, the library, grocery stores, or parks. They also help people feel more connected to their neighbors, which improves quality of life.

Sounds like a great deal, right? Detroit has made an investment in complete streets through its Complete Streets team, which has a designated staff and works regularly on projects that make it safe for people to share the road with cars and trucks. But Detroit does not have a Complete Streets Ordinance, which would codify these policies and ensure the safety of everyone who uses the roads in our community.

Why does Detroit need Complete Streets?

• Detroit has disproportionately high rates of obesity, Type 2 diabetes, cancer and cardio-metabolic conditions, all of which have stress- and physical inactivity-related causes. By providing active transportation options like walking and biking, Complete Streets can improve physical and mental health.

• 22% of Detroit households don’t have vehicles, and the high cost of car ownership makes them unaffordable for many. Complete Streets provides more options for everyone to get where they need to go.

• Detroit has one of the highest pedestrian fatality rates among all U.S. cities. Factors have led to a major increase in road fatalities for motorists, bicyclists, and pedestrians. In recent years, these fatality numbers have continued to climb.

In addition, Complete Streets help reduce speeding without the need for police enforcement. They also improve economic development by making retail areas flourish through investments that make it easier for residents to access local businesses.

Why do we need a Complete Streets ordinance?

Our current administration, including the mayor and his administrative team, have done a great job of supporting complete streets projects that include sidewalks that connect to parks, public transportation and schools; roads that include designated and protected bike lanes; and streets that accommodate all people.

But what happens when there is a change in administration? How do we ensure that these policies — which help us safely be active and improve the quality of life for everyone — continue?

Several community organizations, including the Detroit Greenways Coalition and the American Heart Association, have tried to convince the Department of Public Works of the need for a Complete Streets ordinance, but without success.

That reluctance to codify this important policy need has been baffling many of us involved in the process. We know that there are fewer crashes involving walkers when streets have sidewalks. People, including parents with strollers, people with disabilities, children and older adults, need sidewalks and crosswalks to feel safe.

It is puzzling that a department charged with ensuring the safety of all who use the streets in our community would not want to discuss this important policy with community members.

Let’s work together to improve the quality of life and safety for everyone in our community through an honest and open discussion and work toward passing a Complete Streets Ordinance.

The round was led by Addition, with participation from returning investors including Trust Ventures, Valor Equity Partners, Thrive Capital, Lightspeed, Andreessen Horowitz, Altimeter, StepStone, Elad Gil, 137 Ventures, Terrain, and Waybury. New backers joining the round include Ribbit, CapitalG, Spark, BOND, Lowercarbon, Avenir, Glade Brook, Positive Sum, and 1789.

The funding will accelerate Base Power’s mission to modernize the U.S. energy system and make affordable, reliable power available to households nationwide.

As the country faces mounting challenges from an aging and unreliable electric grid, Base Power aims to reshape how Americans generate, store, and access electricity. The company operates a distributed energy platform that uses advanced storage technologies to supply dependable, low-cost power both to individual homes and the grid at large.

Since its founding in 2023, Base Power has quickly expanded its footprint, deploying more than 100 megawatt-hours (MWh) of residential battery capacity in less than two years. That achievement positions Base among the fastest-scaling distributed energy platforms in the United States.

The company’s growth has been driven by strong consumer demand, strategic partnerships with homebuilders like Lennar, and collaborations with progressive utilities. Base Power currently serves customers across Dallas–Fort Worth, Houston, and Austin, with plans to expand across the country.

To meet surging demand, Base is building its first U.S. manufacturing facility in downtown Austin at the site of the former Austin American-Statesman printing press. The plant will produce energy storage and power electronics equipment, marking a major investment in domestic manufacturing capacity.

Base Power also recently qualified for Texas’s Aggregated Distributed Energy Resource (ADER) program, which enables distributed batteries to be combined and bid directly into the state’s power grid. This innovation strengthens statewide grid reliability and generates new revenue streams, helping Base reduce electricity costs for homeowners while demonstrating that distributed energy assets can perform effectively at utility scale.

How the funding will be used: The company plans to continue expanding its infrastructure and workforce to meet growing nationwide energy needs. With this funding, Base Power aims to accelerate deployment, increase U.S.-based manufacturing, and scale production of its distributed storage systems — critical steps toward what the company describes as a new era of “energy abundance.”

KEY QUOTES:

“The chance to reinvent our power system comes once in a generation. The challenge ahead requires the best engineers and operators to solve it and we’re scaling the team to make our abundant energy future a reality.” Zach Dell, CEO and Co-founder, Base Power

“We’re building domestic manufacturing capacity for fixing the grid. The only way to add capacity to the grid is physically deploying hardware, and we need to make that here in the U.S., ourselves. This factory in Austin is our first, and we’re already planning for our second. We’re building the infrastructure, systems, tools, processes, supporting software, and team that’s reindustrializing America and reinventing the grid.”",https://cdn.pulse2.com/cdn/2025/10/Base-Power-Logo.jpeg,N,,2025-10-15 15:11:47.149240

> Veolia’s commitment to environmental security, sustainability and community support drives partnership with Louisiana’s largest community college and its average enrollment of 21,000 students at five campuses

Veolia, the world’s leading provider of water services and environmental solutions, and Delgado Community College, the largest community college in Louisiana, are launching a Workforce Development Internship Program to provide students with hands-on experience to help them obtain jobs and start careers in the wastewater treatment, sustainability and environmental sectors.

The program offers students the opportunity to work alongside Veolia's experienced professionals at the New Orleans East Bank and West Bank wastewater treatment facilities. The internships will prepare students to build strong careers while providing environmental security to hundreds of thousands of people in the region.

“Delgado Community College’s broad reach across greater New Orleans and its dynamic population of motivated students makes it a natural partner for Veolia, as we meet both the environmental and community needs of the people we serve,” said Joseph Tackett, Veolia’s CEO of Municipal Water Contract Operations in North America. “The water and wastewater industry faces a generational challenge to replenish its aging workforce at the same time it confronts unprecedented environmental changes and threats. Partnering with Delgado creates strong pathways for these students as well as for our environment.”

“Delgado looks forward to launching and growing this partnership with Veolia, which will place our students in a professional environment where they can learn and thrive,” said Dr. Larissa Littleton-Steib, Chancellor at Delgado Community College. “The internships will allow students to position themselves for sustainable careers upon graduation while providing critical workforce needs for the water and wastewater sectors.”

Internship program offers practical training and coaching

Delgado Community College serves an average of 21,000 students annually, and its graduates account for 1 of every 90 jobs in the New Orleans region. Delgado’s Workforce Development, which is collaborating with Veolia on the internships, works with business and industry partners to provide a variety of traditional and non-traditional educational opportunities to students. The initial cohort will provide internships to 15 students.

“The Veolia internships will benefit students enrolled in Delgado Community College’s Water and Wastewater Technology program, which equips students with the technical skills and environmental knowledge needed for careers in water treatment and sustainability,” said Dr. April Noble, Assistant Chair of Physical Science Director of Chemical Technology, and leader of the Water and Wastewater Technology Program at Delgado.

Delgado’s curriculum, paired with Veolia’s hands-on training, will provide students with real-world experience that prepares them for certification and employment in the vital water and wastewater sectors. These experiences will foster a deeper understanding of water industry practices, promote problem solving skills, and help students build relationships with water sector professionals.

Veolia continues to expand its workforce development footprint, targeting high school students and recent graduates, opportunity youth, technical and community colleges, universities and retired military members. In the 2024-25 school year, Veolia reached more than 55,000 students across its American municipal water operations, including educational tours for thousands of students and more than 2,000 classes taught. By building strong partnerships with school systems and non-profit organizations, Veolia is transforming workforce development and opening new career pathways for the next generation of the water workforce.

Veolia’s strategic GreenUp program to depollute, decarbonize and preserve resources inspires its comprehensive workforce development efforts across the United States, which provide outreach, training and support to help people find fulfilling careers in the water industry. Veolia programs offer specialized outreach to high school and college students as well as promising individuals who never received their degrees; retired military members entering the civilian workforce after serving their country; and people in underserved areas seeking good jobs that help their communities.

If you’re thinking about upgrading your home with solar panels, energy-efficient windows, or a new HVAC system, the clock is ticking. Two of America’s biggest eco-friendly tax credits — the Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit (EEHIC) and the Residential Clean Energy Credit (RCEC) — are set to expire on January 1, 2026, after the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBA).

Homeowners across the United States have a limited window to claim valuable federal energy tax credits. These incentives can save thousands of dollars on energy-efficient home upgrades. But the clock is ticking. All credits are set to expire on December 31, 2025.

The two main credits available are the Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit and the Residential Clean Energy Credit. Both are designed to encourage homeowners to reduce energy use and adopt clean energy solutions. These programs have been a major financial help to homeowners looking to make their homes more eco-friendly.

The Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit covers 30% of qualifying home improvement costs. This includes upgrades like insulation, energy-efficient windows, doors, and HVAC systems. Homeowners can claim up to $1,200 per year for general improvements. Specific upgrades, such as heat pumps and water heaters, have higher limits, reaching $2,000 per year.

Meanwhile, the Residential Clean Energy Credit offers a 30% tax credit for renewable energy installations. This includes solar panels, wind turbines, geothermal heat pumps, and battery storage systems. Unlike the home improvement credit, there is no annual or lifetime cap, making it a huge opportunity for homeowners investing in larger clean energy systems.

Both programs were first created under the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and later expanded through the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) under the Biden administration. The IRA extended these incentives to 2032, but the OBBA rolled back that timeline by six years — also ending the popular $7,500 electric vehicle tax credit.

Live Events

The goal of these credits is to reward homeowners for investing in energy-saving or renewable systems. That includes projects like:

Replacing old windows, doors, or insulation

Installing energy-efficient air conditioners or heat pumps

Adding solar panels, battery storage, or geothermal systems

Many homeowners are still unaware of these savings. Small projects like insulating your attic or replacing old windows can yield tax benefits. Larger projects, such as installing solar panels or geothermal systems, can provide thousands in savings. Acting before the deadline ensures that you can take full advantage.

These credits not only lower your tax bill but also improve home comfort. Energy-efficient upgrades reduce utility costs, help maintain stable indoor temperatures, and increase your property’s market value. They are investments that pay off in both savings and long-term sustainability.

To claim these credits, homeowners need to file IRS Form 5695 with their tax return. Keeping detailed records, including receipts and manufacturer certifications, is essential. Only improvements completed and installed before December 31, 2025, qualify for the credits.

These tax credits can make a serious dent in your tax bill:

The average EEHIC claim in 2023 was $880.

The average RCEC deduction reached about $5,000.

The EEHIC typically covers 30% of qualifying improvement costs, up to specific annual limits ($600 for windows, $500 for doors, $2,000 for heat pumps). The RCEC allows a similar 30% deduction for renewable energy systems such as solar, wind, and geothermal installations.

With less than three months remaining before the expiration, now is the time to plan and execute your upgrades. By acting quickly, homeowners can maximize savings, improve their homes, and contribute to a greener future. Missing the deadline could mean losing out on substantial financial benefits.

What home energy tax credits are expiring soon?

Homeowners have a limited time to take advantage of federal tax credits for energy-efficient home improvements and clean energy systems. These credits are set to expire on December 31, 2025.

The Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit and the Residential Clean Energy Credit can save you hundreds or even thousands of dollars. But if you delay, you may miss out entirely.

These credits are designed to encourage homeowners to make upgrades that reduce energy use. They also help lower your monthly utility bills while making your home more eco-friendly.

Many homeowners are unaware of the savings available. Acting now ensures you get the full benefit before the credits disappear at the end of the year.

How much can I save with the energy efficient home improvement credit?

The energy-efficient home improvement credit covers 30% of the cost of qualifying home improvements. This can include insulation, new windows, doors, and HVAC systems.

There are specific annual limits. You can claim up to $1,200 per year for general improvements. For certain high-efficiency upgrades like heat pumps, water heaters, and biomass stoves, you can claim up to $2,000 per year.

This means that if you plan carefully, you could save as much as $3,200 in a single year on eligible improvements. Small upgrades like insulation and new doors can make a difference, but larger systems like heat pumps can maximize your savings.

Claiming these credits also helps increase the value of your home. Energy-efficient upgrades are attractive to buyers and can make your home more comfortable and cost-efficient.

What counts for the residential clean energy credit?

The residential clean energy credit provides a 30% tax credit for installing renewable energy systems. This includes solar panels, solar water heaters, wind turbines, geothermal heat pumps, and battery storage systems.

Unlike the home improvement credit, there is no annual or lifetime cap on this credit. You can claim 30% of the total cost, which can amount to thousands of dollars depending on the system you install.

This credit encourages homeowners to adopt clean energy solutions that reduce reliance on traditional energy sources. Solar panels, for example, not only save money on electricity bills but also reduce your carbon footprint.

If you are planning a major upgrade like solar or geothermal systems, now is the perfect time to act. The full credit is available only for projects installed before the end of 2025.

How do I claim these tax credits?

Claiming energy tax credits is straightforward if you follow the steps carefully. First, make sure your improvements are installed and in use before December 31, 2025. Only completed and operational systems qualify.

Next, file IRS Form 5695 with your tax return for the year the improvements were made. This form reports the cost of your energy-efficient or clean energy upgrades.

It’s essential to keep detailed records. Save receipts, manufacturer certifications, and installation dates for every qualifying improvement. These documents may be required if the IRS asks for verification.

Complete your project before Dec. 31, 2025. Only improvements placed in service by this date qualify.

Save your receipts and manufacturer certifications. You’ll need proof of energy efficiency and installation costs.

File IRS Form 5695 (“Residential Energy Credits”) when submitting your federal tax return for the year you completed the work.

Claim 30% of eligible costs on your return — but remember, these are non-refundable credits, meaning they can reduce your tax bill but won’t trigger a refund beyond your owed taxes.

Following these steps carefully ensures you maximize your savings and avoid errors that could delay your refund or reduce your credit.

Who is eligible for these credits?

The credits are available only for your primary residence. Vacation homes or rental properties do not qualify.

The credits are nonrefundable, meaning they can reduce your tax bill to zero but will not generate a refund beyond what you owe. You also cannot carry forward unused credits to future years.

Certain improvements require a Qualified Manufacturer Identification Number (QMID). This applies to heat pumps, biomass stoves, and some water heaters. Make sure to include the QMID on your tax forms to avoid problems with your claim.

These rules are in place to ensure only eligible homeowners benefit from the program. Double-check each item before claiming the credit.

Why should I act now to get these credits?

With the deadline approaching, now is the best time to plan and install your energy-efficient upgrades. Waiting until next year will mean losing these tax-saving opportunities.

Making upgrades now allows you to save money on taxes, lower your utility bills, and increase your home’s energy efficiency. Small upgrades, like sealing air leaks or upgrading insulation, can make an immediate difference.

For larger projects, like solar panels or geothermal systems, acting now ensures you capture the maximum credit before the program expires. Homeowners who wait risk missing out entirely.

Upgrading your home before the end of 2025 is also a step toward a more sustainable lifestyle, helping reduce your environmental impact.

How can I maximize my savings?

To get the most from these credits, combine multiple qualifying improvements. For example, pair new insulation with a heat pump or add solar panels alongside energy-efficient windows.

Plan your projects so that all systems are installed and operational before December 31, 2025. This ensures full credit eligibility.

Keep careful records of every improvement, including receipts, certifications, and installation dates. Accurate documentation is essential for a smooth tax filing process.

Consider consulting a tax professional if you have multiple improvements or larger projects. They can help you calculate your total credit and ensure you claim every eligible dollar.

Plant investment details

The $13 billion investment plan includes research and development and supplier costs to execute the company’s full product strategy over the next four years as well as investments in its manufacturing operations. The details of the plant-specific investments follow:

Illinois

Stellantis intends to invest more than $600 million to reopen the Belvidere Assembly Plant to expand production of the Jeep® Cherokee and Jeep Compass for the US market. With an initial production launch expected in 2027, these actions are anticipated to create around 3,300 new jobs.

Ohio

With an investment of nearly $400 million, assembly of an all-new midsize truck, previously allocated to the Belvidere plant, plans to move to the Toledo Assembly Complex, where it will join the Jeep Wrangler and Jeep Gladiator. The production shift could create more than 900 jobs. Launch timing is expected in 2028.

The company also intends to continue with investments in its Toledo operations as previously announced in January. This includes additional technologies and strong product actions for both the Jeep Wrangler and Jeep Gladiator, and more components critical to production at the Toledo Machining Plant.

Michigan

Stellantis plans to develop an all-new range-extended EV and internal combustion engine large SUV that will be produced at the Warren Truck Assembly Plant beginning in 2028. The company will invest nearly $100 million to retool the facility.

It is anticipated that the new program will add more than 900 jobs at the plant, which currently assembles the Jeep Wagoneer and Grand Wagoneer.

The company also expects to invest $130 million to prepare the Detroit Assembly Complex – Jefferson for production of the next-generation Dodge Durango, reaffirming its commitment from January. Production is anticipated to launch in 2029.

Indiana

The company confirms its January announcement to make additional investments in several of its Kokomo facilities to produce the all-new four-cylinder engine – the GMET4 EVO – beginning in 2026.

The company plans to invest more than $100 million and to add more than 100 jobs to ensure that the US will be the manufacturing home of this strategic powertrain.

Stellantis’ US footprint includes 34 manufacturing facilities, parts distribution centers and research and development locations across 14 states.

These operations support more than 48,000 employees, 2,600 dealers and nearly 2,300 suppliers in thousands of communities across the country.

RTI accounted for more than two-thirds of that total, the report notes.
The contract terminations have prompted three rounds of layoffs, affecting more than a third of its workforce, the report notes.
The largest RTI grant detailed by DOGE was a $95 million grant to “identify and support underserved communities in desperate need of environmental assistance,” the report notes.","The Trump Administration’s decision to roll back federal spending on science and medical studies has affected many U.S. research institutions, but the impact on Durham-based Research Triangle Institute “is in a category of its own,” according to a new study.

In the administration’s first seven months, RTI received notice that 57 research grants and 52 contracts were terminated, according to the study by Harris Search Associates, a Columbus, Ohio-based executive search and consulting firm that specializes in higher education. No other institution had more than eight cancellations.

Harris studied the effects of cancellations at 76 members of the Association of Independent Research Institutes, which include St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee, the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center in Seattle and the Scripps Research Institute in San Diego. Each suffered from one to eight grant terminations in a process led by the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, which the Trump Administration directed to ferret out waste and fraud.

RTI had grant and contract terminations totaling $1.2 billion according to DOGE data, the study notes.

Overall, DOGE’s online database shows 18 members of the research institution trade group had experienced at least one federal grant or contract termination, with overall savings of $1.65 billion. RTI accounted for more than two-thirds of that total, the report notes.

The accuracy of DOGE’s statistics have been challenged by many groups, which contend savings from cuts are exaggerated. But the real world impact on RTI is clear.

“Since its creation back in the late 1950s as an anchor to Research Triangle Park, RTI was buoyed by this narrative that science and logic and a can-do spirit can solve vexing problems here and abroad, says Jon Schwantes, a Harris senior consultant who worked on the study. “But they were in the wrong place at the wrong time.”

RTI celebrated its 60th anniversary in 2023 with more than 6,000 employees in 90-plus countries, including about 2,000 in the Triangle. The contract terminations have prompted three rounds of layoffs, affecting more than a third of its workforce, the report notes.

The key factor is that RTI hitched its wagon to the US Agency for International Development, or USAID, receiving $2.3 billion between 2013-22, ranking sixth among all agency grantees, Schwantes says. That included $219 million in 2024, more than any other group except for Catholic Relief Services and Durham-based FHI 360, formerly called Family Health International, Harris said in its report.

But on his first day in office, President Donald Trump suspended all foreign aid for 90 days, and showed particular rancor towards USAID, which was formed in 1961 in the Kennedy Administration.

Beyond its reliance on USAID, RTI’s other challenge was its involvement in many programs that could be perceived as woke,” Schwantes says. Those include projects involving gun violence, tobacco usage, environmental justice, carbon capture and many other topics. The largest RTI grant detailed by DOGE was a $95 million grant to “identify and support underserved communities in desperate need of environmental assistance,” the report notes.

Harris didn’t have an agenda in producing the report, Schwates says. “Our intent is to bring clarity to a subject that has not received the kind of attention it deserves.”

""We need to fix charging to sell EVs, to take internal combustion engine cars off the road over time and avoid emissions,"" Buckberg said.
Realities for drivers According to Buckberg, most electric vehicles on the market have a range of 230 miles or more on a single charge.
According to Buckberg, this investment is crucial to increasing the share of EVs on the road and reaping the environmental benefits.
""It's a really cheap option at a time where we've got pullback of federal incentives that would raise the number of registered EVs.""","Compared to gasoline-powered cars, electric vehicles can save money at the pump, produce less harmful emissions, and avoid high maintenance costs. Why then, are so few Americans switching to EVs? The main reason, according to Elaine Buckberg, senior fellow at Harvard's Salata Institute for Climate and Sustainability, is the hassle of charging on the go.

In a recent talk at Harvard Kennedy School, Buckberg, a former chief economist for General Motors, explored the realities of commuting with an electric vehicle, and why the lack of charging infrastructure is preventing the shift in consumer behavior needed to reduce transportation emissions.

Transportation accounts for 28% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, and light-duty vehicles like passenger cars account for a total of 17%.

""We need to fix charging to sell EVs, to take internal combustion engine cars off the road over time and avoid emissions,"" Buckberg said.

Realities for drivers

According to Buckberg, most electric vehicles on the market have a range of 230 miles or more on a single charge. For most Americans, that's an average week of driving.

But consumers aren't thinking about their daily, or even weekly, habits when considering making the switch to an electric vehicle, said Buckberg. What car buyers want is a vehicle that can reliably take them on a cross-country trip should the need arise.

""What if some weekend, they needed to take both kids and drop them off in different places, one at a soccer match and one had, I don't know, dance competition, and they were both long-distance,"" she said. ""That might be a problem.""

At present, Buckberg said, most EV owners are also homeowners with access to at-home charging. But public infrastructure—which would be crucial to expanding EV ownership—is still spotty.

""So people who can't charge at home, or maybe can't also charge in their workplace, they're really going to rely on public charging,"" she said. ""That's generally city dwellers and renters.""

Publicly available chargers—including both Level 2, which take roughly three to five hours to reach a full charge, and fast chargers that can reach a nearly full charge in around 20 minutes—currently sit at around 61,000 across the country, according to Buckberg. That's up from 46,000 last year.

""But not nearly keeping up with the stock of EVs,"" she added.

For comparison, there are more than double the amount of gas-fueling stations in the U.S.—many with multiple pumps for use.

Buckberg added that there is little reliability in a charger working, and a lack of real-time data for drivers. According to her research, only 34% of charging stations share real-time data that apps like Chargepoint and PlugShare use to inform their users on where to plug in. On some of the highways her team has studied, the gaps in available data exceed 1,300 miles.

""There's no one-stop app to find chargers, which means it can be hard to find out whether a charger is working,"" she said. ""Who's responsible? Who do you tell when it's broken? So they don't get fixed.""

Potential policy solutions

Currently, the federal government is not prioritizing increasing EV purchasing, as has been a trend in recent years, she said. It has cut incentive programs, including tax credits and spending programs, to improve availability of real-time charger data for drivers.

According to Buckberg, this investment is crucial to increasing the share of EVs on the road and reaping the environmental benefits. Her research shows that universal real-time data on highway fast chargers would raise new EV sales by 6.4 percentage points in 2030—or 3.5 million additional EVs on the road in 2030 compared to the status quo. That would grow the overall share of EVs on the road by 15% and in turn create a reduction in emissions of about 15 million metric tons, she said.

""Data transparency could cure range anxiety,"" she said in her talk. ""Imagine that you could go to Google Maps, you could go to Apple Maps, you could go to whatever is the killer new EV app, and you could get reliable information.""

But there is still hope, she said. In partnership with scholars Ari Peskoe, Carrie Jenks, and Eliza Martin at Harvard Law School, Buckberg's team has developed example legislation for state governments that would establish common standards for EV-charging providers to increase the reliability of their data.

""No expensive federal investment or tax credits,"" she said. ""It's a really cheap option at a time where we've got pullback of federal incentives that would raise the number of registered EVs.""

And, Buckberg said, having states take the lead would reduce resistance for charging providers that have not made sharing data a priority.

""From a state perspective, this could be justified because it yields benefits at very low cost,"" she said.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2025/want-americans-to-love.jpg,N,,2025-10-15 16:09:29.736000

Stellantis plans to invest $13 billion in the U.S. over the next four years to increase domestic finished vehicle production by 50% over current levels and boost its market share, per an Oct. 14 press release.

The plans involve launching five new vehicles in key segments, including production of a new 4-cylinder engine. The automaker’s manufacturing investments will add over 5,000 new jobs across four of its factories in Illinois, Ohio, Michigan and Indiana.

“This investment in the U.S. — the single largest in the Company’s history — will drive our growth, strengthen our manufacturing footprint and bring more American jobs to the states we call home,” Stellantis CEO Antonio Filosa said in a statement.

Dive Insight:

As part of the $13 billion investment, Stellantis plans to launch 19 refreshed products across all of its U.S. manufacturing facilities through 2029, including models with updated powertrains.

“As we begin our next 100 years, we are putting the customer at the center of our strategy, expanding our vehicle offerings and giving them the freedom to choose the products they want and love,” Filosa said in a statement.

Stellantis plans to invest more than $600 million to reopen its shuttered Belvidere Assembly Plant in Illinois to expand production of the Jeep Cherokee and Jeep Compass SUVs for the U.S. market. The Belvidere facility is expected to add roughly 3,300 jobs and begin producing the first vehicles in 2027. Stellantis closed the Illinois factory in February 2023 as part of a cost-cutting move, but in September told WardsAuto that it had plans to reopen the plant.

In Ohio, the automaker plans to invest $400 million in its Toledo Assembly Complex to build an all-new mid-size pickup. Production is scheduled to start in 2028 and expected to create around 900 jobs. The Ohio factory will also produce the Jeep Wrangler and Gladiator.

In Michigan, Stellantis is investing $100 million to retool its Warren Truck Assembly Plant to produce an all-new range-extended EV and a new full-size SUV with an internal combustion engine. Production is expected to start in 2028. The plant currently produces the Jeep Wagoneer and Grand Wagoneer.

The automaker unveiled the redesigned 2026 Grand Wagoneer this week, which is being offered with two powertrain options, a range-extended version and a model equipped with the automaker’s 3.0-liter Hurricane twin-turbo engine.

Stellantis also plans to invest $130 million to prepare its Detroit Assembly Complex to build the next-generation Dodge Durango SUV. Production is expected to begin in 2029.

Meanwhile, in Indiana, Stellantis will begin producing a new 4-cylinder engine at its Kokomo plant beginning in 2026. The automaker is investing over $100 million in the factory to produce the engine, which is expected to add over 100 jobs.

The $13 billion investment announcement comes as Stellantis works to regain its footing in 2025 following significant revenue declines in 2024.

In July, the automaker reported that its first half revenues fell 13% compared to the same period last year, resulting in an operating loss of 2.3 billion euros. The company’s net revenue for the first six months of 2025 also fell to 74.3 billion euros, which it largely blamed on sales declines and loss of market share in North America and Europe.

But the company has been working on its turnaround plans since appointing Antonio Filosa as its new CEO on June 23. He succeeded Carlos Tavares, who resigned in December 2024 amid declining sales and profits. Filosa announced a new leadership team on the same day, made up of executives who he said “bring an entrepreneurial spirit and profound understanding of the company’s brands.”

Stellantis currently operates 34 manufacturing facilities, distribution centers, and research and development sites in the U.S., which together support over 48,000 employees, according to the release.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/H-lfd0Xzogm-CtpcMmY-RtqA9uD_RZvBPBR2MeF86w8/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS85M2VhYjVkMDg3NjZlMGI0ZmUzY2ZkNWU5MDE0ZTgwMS53ZWJw.webp,N,,2025-10-15 14:04:10.116021

And that can translate to more-reasonable prices for drivers, Lee says.","As a young SpaceX engineer, Quincy Lee led a rollout of hundreds of terrestrial antennas for Elon Musk’s Starlink Internet service. The project covered three continents, took just 24 months—and turned out to be great preparation for Lee’s next chapter.

Lee, now the founder and CEO of Electric Era, wants to make EV charging faster, ubiquitous, and more affordable for drivers and for retailers looking to lure customers and still turn a profit on electricity. As part of that, the company today announced its second-generation RetailEdge chargers. The sleek DC chargers can deliver up to 400 kilowatts, on par with the most-powerful public chargers in America. But for the Seattle-based company, the real innovation is stationary power storage, something you won’t find at any charger from top players such as Tesla, Electrify America, or Ionna.

The RetailEdge stations can amass 370 kilowatt-hours of storage for a station with eight customer stalls. Taking a page from Starlink satellites, the chargers include software to let chargers self-identify and fix faults remotely. Backed by a box full of prismatic LFP batteries, sourced from China, the company’s chargers can deliver roughly four times as much power as what’s actually being supplied by the grid itself. Lee calls that a potential game-changer for an aging, overmatched electrical grid that was not built for a world in which millions of drivers would demand access to industrial-level juice.

“A simple way to think about it is, a typical charging station consumes 1,000 homes’ worth of power on a city block. We can take that down to about 300 homes,” Lee says, while still delivering charging speeds that rival the industry’s best.

Efficient EV Charging Transformers

EV drivers have seen the hulking green transformer boxes that supply stations, including ones with roughly 1,000 kilovolt-amperes, the unit that describes a system’s total electrical power. In contrast, Electric Era stations use smaller, circular transformers—think the ones hung from telephone poles in residential neighborhoods—that can cost as little as US $16,000. (those beefier units can cost up to $100,000.) That makes for faster permitting and grid upgrades, a potential end-run around construction snafus that can delay DC projects, with some taking more than two years to complete

“The transformers are cheaper, easier to source, and take up less space,” Lee says. “We can swap larger pieces of power conversion equipment for smaller ones, and still serve up to 140 charging sessions a day for our midsized stations.”

With nearly 120 of its first-generation, 200-kilowatt DC chargers currently in the ground for customers including Costco and Shell, Electric Era says it can decrease installation times and costs by roughly a factor of four. Projects are going from contract to completion in six to nine months on average, and some in as little as two to three months.

For its midsize stations with four charging stalls, the company needs only 370 kilovolt-amperes of installed capacity, about one-third that of some typical DC stations. (The kVa figure describes total apparent power, the product of a circuit’s maximum voltage and current.) The rest is supplied by 220 kilowatt-hours of stationary battery storage, barely more than the 205 kilowatt-hours found in a Cadillac Escalade IQ or GMC Hummer EV.

As drivers plug in, the system automatically balances power between grid and battery supplies. EVs get all the juice they can handle, with stations able to operate 24/7 without any significant curtailment of power.

“Most EVs are only accepting peak power for a few minutes, so we can then use intelligent load management to service another car, and power all the cars at the right time,” Lee says.

Electricity becomes dramatically cheaper as well. Utility customers pay for both electricity they actually use, and the infrastructure wiring that guarantees a ready supply at peak demand. The latter results in “demand charges” that are a notorious obstacle to a profitable, sustainable EV charging business. The higher the ultimate capacity, the higher the charges, even when no car is actually filling up.

“That makes the economics much easier to pencil,” Lee says. “Our customers’ electricity charges are about 50 percent lower, because of demand-charge savings.”

AI-Driven Cost Savings for EV Stations

The company says its system, backed by an AI platform and an intuitive, voice-based screen assistant that can operate in multiple languages, can reduce retail operator costs by up to 70 percent. And that can translate to more-reasonable prices for drivers, Lee says. A 2024 Harvard Business School study of EV charging that analyzed 1 million consumer reviews of charging experiences around the United States showed that “Wild West” pricing, and a lack of pricing transparency, are major sources of frustration for drivers.

Or don’t ask Harvard: At many Electrify America stations, such as one near me in Providence, R.I., drivers pay up to 64 cents per kilowatt-hour. The cost of convenience is daunting: According to an EV calculator, at those prices, a driver would spend roughly $3,000 a year for enough juice to cover 15,000 miles in a Hyundai Ioniq5 SUV. At current prices for regular unleaded, a driver would spend only $1,600 to drive the same distance in a model that gets 30 miles per gallon (about 13 kilometers per liter).

At Electric Era stations, where retailers set their own prices, customers pay about 45 cents per kilowatt-hour on average, about one-third less than many EA stations.

As EVs proliferate, more retailers are seeing the long-predicted upside of luring customers with electricity. A captive charging audience will hopefully spend money at the business, whether it’s a gas station, convenience store, restaurant, or shopping mall.

“For years, that didn’t work, because there were too few EVs on the road,” Lee says. “But the calculus is shifting, and retailers are putting real estate aside (for chargers).”

The company claims a 99.8-percent uptime, and a 93-percent reliability rate, meaning seven percent of people who plug in fail to get a charge for any reason, from payment glitches to user error. The same Harvard study posted a troubling 78-percent reliability score for public charging, meaning about one in five charging attempts ended in failure.

As Lee says, “One of the things we learned at SpaceX is that you can’t send a repair truck to space, and we’ve adopted the same methodology.”",https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/image.jpg?id=61747215&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C497%2C0%2C453,N,,2025-10-15 17:09:46.768481

The Cornucopia Hybrid Project is expected to supply energy for up to 300,000 homes.","Chapter 2: How California’s Power Grid Rebuilt Itself

In the early 2000s, blackouts rocked California. More than two dozen of them in total.

""It's still debated to this day what happened,"" said Andy Campbell, the executive director of the Energy Institute at Haas at UC Berkeley. ""A lot of things happened, but a key enabler of the energy crisis were actions of the California legislature.""

Campbell works with a dozen energy and environmental economists, researching the energy of the future — which sometimes requires examining the past.

""Laws were passed in the mid-1990s. There was sort of a desire at that time to try to reform the way the energy business was structured,"" Campbell said. ""There were several large vertically integrated utilities. The same company owned all the power plants, they owned all the transmission lines, they owned all the distribution lines. There was sort of a desire to see if there's a different way of doing things.""

According to Campbell, a major problem was the state legislature passed laws requiring buyers of electricity to buy all of their electricity on a real-time basis.

""They just had to buy energy at the price that was available at the point in time they bought it,"" Campbell said.

This left open the possibility for bad actors to game California's energy system by causing supply and demand issues. When demand outpaces supply, the grid becomes strained, and without any additional energy to make up the difference, major outages can occur. And in 2000 and 2001, they did.

""Enron was not the only one, but Enron was the biggest one to basically manipulate the market,"" Campbell said. ""They'd (Enron) basically tell the grid operator, 'Oh sorry, my power plant is broken. There's a problem with the power plant, it's down.' Prices would spike. Enron had some other power plants. They're now selling energy at those very high prices.""

During the energy crisis, some of the state’s biggest investor-owned utilities — such as Pacific Gas and Electric — went bankrupt. The state legislature passed several emergency bills, with the primary goal of stabilizing the grid. And in an effort to avoid a similar crisis in the future, California began taking more active roles in planning new power generation and transmission lines.

""Our job is to keep the lights on,"" said Elliot Mainzer, speaking from an observation room above the control room floor of the California Independent System Operator, better known as CAISO.

""I like to sometimes say that we're sort of a combination of a control tower operator and the NASDAQ,"" said Mainzer, the president and CEO of CAISO. ""We have the responsibility of overseeing the flow of electricity across the high voltage transmission system in California and making sure that there's a constant balance of supply and demand. We're constantly taking bids for supply and demand and balancing the system at the lowest possible cost, both within the state of California and administer a market that covers about 80% of the Western United States.""

CAISO plays a role somewhat like an air traffic controller for a power grid that includes most of Arizona, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah, Washington and Wyoming — and of course, all of California.

""All of this requires a lot of coordination, a lot of collaboration, and a lot of synchronization to make sure we accomplish all these functions efficiently,"" Mainzer said. ""California is sitting on a very healthy, pretty balanced portfolio, and I think part of our challenge in the years ahead is to continue to work with our energy planners to make sure that we have that portfolio that is cleaner and cleaner and cleaner over the years.""

A big player in California's energy portfolio is Pacific Gas and Electric. PG&E is one of the state’s — and the country’s — largest utility companies.

""We have really strong partnerships with California ISO,"" said Quinn Nakayama, PG&E's senior director of Grid Innovation, Research, and Development. He was speaking in front of one of his company's recently upgraded substations in Sutter County.

""We partner very closely together around where are our major load growths are going towards,"" Nakayama said. ""And then we work together to say, well, which of these assets need to then be built out to accommodate that load?""

And a lot more load is expected. Over the next 20 years, PG&E is forecasting an increase of 70%.

""As all these industries continue to develop and rise, and especially with data centers which have significant amounts of power draw with things like artificial intelligence now becoming a real big thing here in California, we're having to build out infrastructure,"" Nakayama said. ""We can't get away from the build, but where we want to do innovation is in areas where maybe we don't need to build as much.""

""One great example is that we have a technology called smart wires or smart valves,"" Nakayama said.

He shared an example with cars and freeways.

""You have the 80 freeway and the 50 freeway, and these two freeways feed Sacramento to be able to take people from the outer areas into Sacramento,"" Nakayama said. ""Maybe too many people are driving on the 80 freeway and not enough people are driving on the 50 freeway. And more people are trying to drive on the 80 freeway, and now you're needing to build out new infrastructure for the 80 to accommodate all these new people.""

""But if I'm able to take those cars and push them to the 50 freeway and not cause problems, then now I can share the load between these freeways and still feed all of Sacramento,"" Nakayama said. ""To be able to help them grow Sacramento area, while at the same time not having to build another freeway. We're doing the same thing here in our substations.""

It's not all just about upgrades. Being smarter about how the grid distributes power is part of it too.

""When the air conditioning is running, maybe I don't want to charge my car as fast. If we can figure out how to modulate this type of stuff, so it doesn't all need to suck up as much energy all at the same time, all the time, we might not have to upgrade all of our systems to be able to accommodate that,"" Nakayama said.

""If we can do that while not impacting our customers – like, I need to get my car charged at 6 o'clock in the morning – as long as I don't impact that, maybe we can create an environment where we'll be willing to work in that energy ecosystem and then I don't have to do those upgrades, that doesn't have to appear on your bill and everybody saves money,"" Nakayama said. ""That's the beautiful thing about innovation, what we're looking to try to do.""

California has been innovating in other ways too.

""We've done a lot of work to coordinate and anticipate issues, and we've really been able to ride through some pretty hot events here in California without having to call on Flex Alerts,"" Mainzer said.

Flex Alerts were created and first issued in California during the 2000-2001 energy crisis. They are a measure of last resort, calling on Californians to conserve power to avoid rolling blackouts as demand outpaces supply.

""The number of days of the year that we're going to call on these are going to be relatively modest, but it makes a big difference if consumers in relatively large numbers take modest steps to flex their demand for a few hours,"" Mainzer said. ""Particularly that 4 p.m. to 9 p.m. period is the time of day when demand can still be very high, and of course, as the sun starts to set and our solar energy resources start to reduce the amount of power. That can become a strained period on the grid.""

Flex Alerts are instances of true grid shortages, where all available resources are utilized but aren’t enough to meet the demand. California hasn’t had a Flex Alert issued since September 2022, when much of the state saw all-time record heat but no blackouts — thanks in large part to more battery storage.

""Back in 2020, we only had about 200 megawatts of batteries on our grid. In the last 4 or 5 years, we've now got almost 13,000 megawatts of batteries on our system. It's made a huge difference,"" Mainzer said.

It also helps to have a power grid that is bigger than the weather, something Mainzer often says. By connecting to other states in the west, CAISO can send power from typically cooler states – like Idaho or Washington – to California during the summer to meet increased demand. And during the winter, California can send excess power up north.

""We have a grid that's bigger than the weather,"" Mainzer said. ""We have huge amount of transmission that connects up to the hydro resources in the Pacific Northwest. We've got transmission resources that go out into the Desert Southwest all the way out into the Intermountain West. We're also engaged in the construction of some big new transmission lines that will further open up into New Mexico, up into Wyoming, and all the way across Nevada up into Idaho that will give California additional access to clean energy resources, create some additional opportunities for us to export surplus and will strengthen the foundation of our regional energy market.""

All of this is just part of meeting California's clean energy goal.

""We are continually looking for new technologies and new energy procurements to get us to a net zero energy system by 2045,"" Nakayama said.

Chapter 3: Can California Build to a Carbon-Free Future?

California’s goal of reaching 100% carbon-free energy by 2045 depends on a delicate balance — generating enough clean, reliable power to meet a rapidly growing demand while keeping costs affordable for residents and businesses.

High in the Sierra Nevada, a network of lakes and reservoirs powers communities far below. The Sacramento Municipal Utility District (SMUD) operates 12 reservoirs and nine powerhouses that not only provide recreation and wildlife habitat but also supply hydropower to the Sacramento area.

“Hydropower is a tried and true method going back to the 1800s — spinning a wheel with water,” said Darold Perry of SMUD. “It provides about 20% of our energy needs in an average year. It can go higher in wetter years, and it allows us to provide reliable, affordable energy.”

The district’s hydroelectric system, built in the 1950s and 1960s, has evolved from providing steady “baseline” power to delivering more energy during peak afternoon and evening hours when demand and prices rise.

“Our hydrogeneration portfolio is critical for SMUD’s 2030 zero-carbon initiative,” said Dan Strickland, adding that the plan is among the most aggressive in the country. “We want to keep our rates as low as possible for all Sacramento ratepayers.”

California’s broader clean-energy goals mirror that ambition. SMUD aims to go 100% renewable by 2030, while the state’s target is a carbon-free grid by 2045.

Much of that push is powered by the sun. Nearly 2 million homes in California now generate solar electricity, helping make it cheaper and more abundant. This year, solar energy became the state’s largest source of power, surpassing natural gas and supplying more than one-third of California’s total energy.

The growth of solar has created a new challenge known as the “duck curve.” During daylight hours, energy demand dips as solar production peaks, then it surges again in the late afternoon as the sun sets and air conditioners and appliances switch on.

To meet those needs, California is fast-tracking massive new solar and storage projects. The Darden Clean Energy Project in Fresno County will use more than 3 million solar panels and batteries to power 850,000 homes. The Cornucopia Hybrid Project is expected to supply energy for up to 300,000 homes.

Innovation continues at the local level, too. The Turlock Irrigation District received a $20 million state grant to install solar panels over irrigation canals, an experiment designed to both generate power and reduce water evaporation.

“We’re the oldest irrigation district but trying new things is in our DNA,” said TID spokesperson Josh Weimer. “We say yes to projects. We look at different solutions for the challenges ahead of us.

If successful, the canal project could eventually expand to sections of the California Aqueduct.

“It’s a potential solution, because we’re going to need all options on the table to reach a 100% carbon-free grid by 2045,” Weimer said.

Wind power is another major piece of the state’s clean-energy equation. California’s wind industry began in the 1980s in the Altamont Pass, but stronger and steadier winds blow offshore along the coast. Proposed offshore projects near Humboldt and Morro Bay have drawn pushback from fishermen and coastal residents worried about environmental and economic impacts.

“We don’t know what the cumulative impacts will be — not just on fisheries but on the entire marine ecosystem,” said Mike Conroy of West Coast Fisheries Consultants. “If we’re going to do this, let’s do it right.”

Despite the challenges, energy experts say California continues to break ground on renewable milestones.

“Last year alone, California’s grid ran on 100% clean energy for the equivalent of 51 full days,” said Alex Jackson with the American Clean Power Association. “If trends hold, that number could rise to 80 days this year.”

Stanford researchers project the state could operate on 100% renewable energy around the clock by 2033.

Just last month, California compiled data from 2023 and found that 67% of its energy came from renewable sources, breaking the record for the third straight year.

Current challenges from federal funding of renewable projects may temporarily slow or stop some projects in the near future, but many existing projects are currently in the planning or construction phases. Renewable energy sources in many cases provide the cheapest and fastest source of new energy even without subsidies from government grants.",https://media.abc10.com/assets/KXTV/images/decdd2e5-bea9-486e-bbf5-ad3f29fa5d64/20251002T173517/decdd2e5-bea9-486e-bbf5-ad3f29fa5d64_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-10-15 18:11:42.072976

MADISON — Gov. Tony Evers sent a letter amid reports that the Trump Administration plans to terminate over 600 U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) funding awards, including more than $1.5 billion in approved funding to Wisconsin-based companies and organizations or projects located in Wisconsin with energy-related goals and objectives. In a letter to DOE Secretary Chris Wright, Gov. Evers noted that terminating these funding awards at a time of record-high energy demand and rising costs would be “counterintuitive, reckless, and ill-advised.”

This letter comes as the governor recently highlighted that efforts by President Trump and Republicans in Congress to roll back clean energy investments will cause the average household energy costs across the U.S. to increase by an additional $170 annually over the next decade, according to a recent analysis by Energy Innovation. In Wisconsin alone, Wisconsinites will face a $300 annual increase on household energy bills due to the actions of the Trump Administration by 2035.

Among the Wisconsin-based projects, companies, and organizations facing terminated funding, totaling over $1.5 billion, include:

Honeywell International Inc. – $123.8 million

Slipstream Group Inc. – $5.1 million

Johnson Controls Inc. – $33 million

A.O. Smith Corporation – $25 million

Modine Manufacturing – $15.7 million

Slipstream Group Inc. – $2.8 million

Wisconsin Regional Training Partnership Inc. – $1.5 million

A copy of the governor’s letter to U.S. DOE Secretary Wright is available here, and a transcript of the letter is available below.

Dear Secretary Wright:

I am writing to express my concern regarding potential terminations of U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) funding awards to entities and businesses in Wisconsin and to urge the Trump Administration to reconsider any plans to terminate these awards. Federal support plays a critical role in advancing the Wisconsin Idea and American innovation, lowering energy bills for families across America, supporting clean energy development to improve energy independence and resilience, creating good-paying jobs in innovative industries and sectors, and maintaining our nation’s leadership in science and technology.

Given these clear benefits and the importance of these investments to Wisconsin’s and our nation’s economy, I was deeply concerned to see reporting last week containing a list of over 600 DOE funding awards that are potentially going to be targeted for termination with no clear reasoning or justification.

From that list, awards to Wisconsin-based companies and organization or projects located partially or fully in Wisconsin total over $1.5 billion alone.

The funding awards in question span across multiple programs with multiple energy-related goals and objectives. For example, multiple funding awards to Wisconsin entities through the Grid Resilience and Innovation Partnerships (GRIP) Program are targeted for termination. The GRIP Program is designed to enhance grid flexibility and improve the resilience of power systems against extreme weather. Terminating this funding will harm Wisconsinites and leave communities more susceptible to power outages and more costly repairs from future extreme weather events.

In addition, the list includes multiple funding awards to Slipstream Inc., a Wisconsin-based organization, to help communities implement energy-saving power systems in buildings. These technologies reduce energy use and lower energy bills, both of which are critical in this moment as we are seeing record-high energy demand and folks across our state are struggling with rising costs. Multiple funding awards through the Long-Duration Energy Storage Demonstrations Program are also listed, including a $28 million award to Dairyland Power Cooperative, headquartered in La Crosse, to build out behind-the-meter energy storage systems to increase energy capacity and improve resilience in rural communities. Further, multiple Wisconsin entities were awarded funding from DOE to help increase domestic production of electric heat pumps through the Heat Pump Defense Production Act Program to drive energy innovation and security while creating new good-paying jobs nationwide. These funding awards are also included on the reported list for termination, creating significant uncertainty.

The University of Wisconsin-Madison is also among the recipients included in the proposed list of projects to be terminated. Our state university system has long been a hub for advanced energy research, and federal funds support cutting-edge work in fields like battery storage, carbon capture, grid modernization, and biofuels. These are areas that are critical for the future of U.S. energy independence, and losing this support will slow technological progress and hamper critical research into new and emerging technologies.

Finally, a roughly $1.5 million award to the Wisconsin Regional Training Partnership (WRTP) to support energy-related workforce training is included in the list for potential termination. Wisconsin is a national leader in apprenticeship and pre-apprenticeship programing, thanks to the work of state and local partners like WRTP. As new technologies develop and building code updates move forward in Wisconsin, a skilled energy workforce will become even more essential.

The projects and funding awards highlighted here are just a few of the many Wisconsin-connected awards and projects facing potential termination. Terminating these funding awards at a time of record-high energy demand and rising costs would be counterintuitive, reckless, and ill-advised. I urge you to reaffirm DOE’s commitment to honoring these funding awards and to continue supporting these investments that drive Wisconsin’s and the nation’s energy landscape forward.

Yours in service,

Tony Evers

Texas is a leader in the carbon economy today, and it should act now to ensure that it remains a leader in the new carbon economy of tomorrow.","The state’s existing workforce, infrastructure, and geological assets make it a natural fit to lead in the new carbon economy, and recently resolved federal policy makes the case even stronger.

Texas has long been a byword for energy leadership, whether that’s in its more-than-century-old oil industry or its position as the number one state in the nation for solar and wind capacity. Another accolade could soon be in reach for the Lone Star state: carbon management pioneer. By utilizing its world-class workforce, pipeline expertise, and unbeatable geological assets, Texas can be the global leader in the new multi-billion-dollar economy of storing and utilizing carbon — creating jobs, revenue, and cementing its status as a first-mover state.

Why now is different

The passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act was a significant moment for nearly every energy technology in the United States, but holds particular promise for carbon management — an emerging industry that creates value from the carbon dioxide produced from industrial activity, either by capturing and reusing it or by storing it. This can take the form of point-source carbon capture from industrial waste streams, direct air capture (DAC), pipelines to transport the carbon dioxide for various end uses, and using geological formations to store the carbon.

One of the critical policies for carbon management is the 45Q carbon oxide sequestration tax credit. Before July 2025, the tax credit was calculated based on the specific features of the project. Under that formulation of the credit, outlined in the Inflation Reduction Act, direct air capture projects qualified for more credit than point-source capture, and projects that stored the captured carbon in permanent storage qualified for more credit than those that sold or used the carbon for further industrial processes. However, the OBBBA modified the credit by raising the value of projects that utilize or sell carbon to equal that of projects that sequester carbon, for both point-source capture facilities and DAC facilities.

Exhibit 1

These changes will have a significant impact on the carbon management industry, closing the cost gap for more types of projects and presenting highly significant financial and job creation opportunities in states that pursue projects and infrastructure supportive of a carbon management economy.

Texas is poised to lead this growing industry

The increased value in 45Q presents a prime opportunity for Texas’s industrial clusters to source carbon at scale and unlock its considerable economic potential. Major industrial activities in Houston, San Antonio, Austin, Dallas-Fort Worth, Corpus Christi, and East Texas represent both sides of the supply and demand equation for carbon management processes, creating the potential for a homegrown industry.

Existing cement, refining, petrochemical, and plastic facilities offer both abundant carbon dioxide streams as well as strong demand for the captured carbon in order to produce urea, synthetic fuels, and other materials. The state offers a large carbon dioxide pool as industry produces over 367 million metric tons (Mt) of CO2 annually statewide, including power generation. Furthermore, the existing 2,325 miles of CO2 pipeline infrastructure, accounting for over 40% of the entire CO2 pipeline infrastructure in the US, can provide the needed infrastructure support to move the carbon where it is needed.

Beyond capturing and utilizing carbon, Texas’s subsurface geography provides unmatched long-term carbon storage capacity. The Department of Energy has estimated that Texas possesses over 1.6 billion Mt in potential storage capacity — equivalent to 4,000 years of today’s carbon output in the state. Texas offers an extensive carbon storage basin through depleted oil and gas reservoirs, and deep saline aquifer formations, which allow for proven containment with reduced costs and technical risks.

This storage capacity can be monetized. Companies that sequester the carbon dioxide underground are eligible to receive the federal 45Q tax credits, while an additional revenue stream can be created through the sale of carbon credits in voluntary carbon markets. Momentum is also building on the regulatory front: the EPA proposed approval of Texas’s Class VI underground injection well primacy application in June 2025. This represents one of the critical steps that will allow the state to streamline permitting for storage and accelerate carbon management.

Given this profile, over $10 billion in investments in carbon management are already flowing into Texas. Occidental Petroleum is investing $500 million to build the world’s largest DAC project in the Permian Basin, with the potential to capture 500,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. ExxonMobil’s acquisition of the 1,300-mile CO2 Denbury pipeline for $1.9 billion is also a critical infrastructure investment to facilitate carbon transportation in the Gulf. In Baytown, ExxonMobil is developing a $7 billion blue hydrogen facility (hydrogen produced via natural gas with carbon capture), the largest of its type in the world, to fuel its olefins plant and capture over 7 Mt of carbon annually. These projects demonstrate the scale and tangibility of Texas’s carbon management opportunity.

Exhibit 2

Exhibit 3

Texas stands to benefit immensely from the near-term opportunity to capture federal dollars from tax credits and generate economic growth. RMI analysis estimates that by 2050, Texas could see between $12 billion and $94 billion in investments in carbon management, and a cumulative economic benefit of $24 billion to $182 billion. (See Exhibit 4)

But carbon management’s benefits extend beyond the bottom line and reach into the wider Texas economy. Addressing carbon management proactively will retain Texas’s national and global status as an energy leader, with all the economic benefits that it brings. It also provides Texas with a low-risk, high-reward response to commercial opportunities from the global shift toward low-carbon energy.

The scaling of the carbon management industry can also support the creation of new jobs in engineering, construction of pipelines and carbon capture hubs, operations for hydrogen, carbon capture, and storage facilities, and advanced manufacturing for newer technologies like DAC and carbon utilization technologies. The world-class Texas oil and gas workforce is perfectly suited to transition into these new roles.

Depending on the uptake of carbon management in Texas, RMI analysis anticipates a cumulative creation of 21,000 to 211,000 new jobs through 2050 (See Exhibit 4).

Exhibit 4

Preparing for, rather than reacting to, the growing carbon management industry is the smartest way for Texas to seize this opportunity

The energy landscape is changing, new technology is emerging, and new policy frameworks are coming. Texas is a leader in the carbon economy today, and it should act now to ensure that it remains a leader in the new carbon economy of tomorrow.

The incentives through OBBBA will further help the economic case for projects that include carbon management technologies, and with its century of expertise in petroleum engineering and geology, and some of the highest-potential injection sites in the country, Texas has the foundation to define the future of carbon management in the United States. This opportunity is Texas’s to seize, and proactive policymakers and economic development organizations should start to get ready.",https://rmi.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/iStock-1780661745-1.jpg,N,,2025-10-15 14:02:21.033167

For the industry, smart grids are fast becoming a prerequisite. Global firms in electronics, automotive, and textiles now demand traceable low-carbon supply chains to meet tightening ESG standards. Countries that can guarantee reliable, renewable-powered electricity will have a competitive edge in attracting these investments. This translates into jobs not only in manufacturing, but also in the construction, installation, and long-term maintenance of the infrastructure that supports industrial growth.

In Senegal, a $10 million smart grid project created nearly 600 jobs, from engineers and construction workers to logistics providers and local service suppliers.

Scaling this to ASEAN’s estimated $4-10.7 billion investment need suggests up to 650,000 jobs could be created across the region. These roles would span design and engineering, digital meter installation, IT integration, and operations, while stimulating opportunities for local businesses that supply equipment, transport, and services.

The social dividends go beyond jobs. By reducing outages, smart grids cut reliance on diesel backup generators, which are widely used by households and businesses in countries like the Philippines and Myanmar. These generators are not only expensive to run but also a major source of urban air pollution.

Cleaner grids mean lower household energy costs, more reliable electricity for small enterprises, and measurable health benefits through reduced respiratory illness linked to pollution.

All of these early electric vehicles benefited from tax breaks approved by Democrats in Congress.
● Used electric cars are now selling faster than their gas counterparts, largely because they are cheaper.
Electric cars are not fizzling out and consumers want to drive them—and for some, doing so is the cheaper option.","If you were looking to buy an electric vehicle and take advantage of the federal tax break that offered car owners between $4,000 and $7,000 in savings, you are SOL.

As of October 1, the break offered through Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act has gone the way of the dodo.

Its demise won’t surprise anyone who’s been following the Trump administration’s systematic dismantling of clean energy programs and incentives. President Donald Trump’s first-day executive order, “Unleashing American Energy,” called for the “elimination of unfair subsidies” and froze a $5 billion program to establish charging stations in rural areas and disadvantaged communities. A federal court this summer ordered the funds to be restored after 14 states sued.

But the end of the EV rebate has highlighted an encouraging reality: It turns out that electric vehicles are more popular than Republicans have been giving them credit for.

In the final days of the rebate, purchases soared. Sales of EVs between July, August and September shot up 21% compared to last year, according to forecasts from tech company Cox Automotive, a 30% increase just from this spring.

Even without the tax breaks, data shows that EVs are here to stay. And the market is proving it.

Elaine Buckberg, a former General Motors economist now at Harvard University’s Salata Institute for Climate and Sustainability, told Bloomberg that she estimates 37% of new cars bought in 2030 will be electric. The reason? Electric cars are getting better, cheaper, and have more options to choose from.

“In the most likely scenario, you end up about two years behind on adoption,” Buckberg said of the impact of the rebate elimination. ”I think [EVs] will be more resilient than people are thinking.”

By all indications, electric vehicles have become commercial enough, economical enough, and—may I suggest—desirable enough that the future of ownership actually feels bright.

Everyone has a different cultural reference when they think back to the early days of clean energy cars. I have memories of stinky, vegetable-oil-guzzling hippie vans I saw traversing my hometown of Santa Barbara, California, and later the OG Prius hybrid hatchbacks my friend’s parents picked us up in after days spent at the beach. In short: They were not cool.

It was in college at George Washington University in 2011 that I got to drive the prototype of the Nissan Leaf, the first mass-market, all-electric vehicle offered in the United States. (I’ll never forget the shame I felt after I took the car out of the parking lot and promptly clipped a curb. All in the name of science, right?)

Later, Teslas helped change the image of electric vehicles from the car for the environmentalist to cars for anyone—well, those who could afford to shell out at least $98,000.

All of these early electric vehicles benefited from tax breaks approved by Democrats in Congress. Back in 2009, Congress passed a bill that offered $2,500 to $7,500 in tax rebates for the purchase of a new, qualified, plug-in EV. Originally, the program limited the credits to the first 200,000 qualifying plug-in EVs sold by each automaker; Tesla and GM were the first to hit the limit by 2019.

Republicans for years threatened to repeal the credits, but Biden actually helped expand the rebate through his 2022 Inflation Reduction Act and lifted the cap.

It would have kept the program going until 2032.

Despite the end to the rebate, there are many promising signs that EVs aren’t going anywhere.

● For one, charging stations expanded 19% just in the first nine months of this year—including a record number of new fast chargers—a growth attributed to companies working to meet the public’s increased demand.

● Brands like Waffle House, Cracker Barrel, and Target are boosting the technology by expanding fast-charging options in their parking lots, including in the deep south.

● Used electric cars are now selling faster than their gas counterparts, largely because they are cheaper. And it’s leading unlikely consumers to consider buying EVs for the first time.

●Internationally, countries are also doubling down on electric-vehicle investment. Last week, Germany’s chancellor agreed to offer €3 billion (nearly $3.5 billion) in EV purchase incentives. Italy’s incentives program starts this month. Other countries that offer big price cuts include Poland and Greece.

●At home, 17 states offer state tax incentives for EV purchases. Colorado recently upped its incentive, now offering car owners up to $9,000 to swap their gas vehicles for an EV lease or sale. The city of Burlington, Vermont, in September announced plans to double its EV rebate to $5,000.

Of course, it’s not all rosey. Some predict the EV market will take a big dip after the tax breaks end. A study in November 2024 from professors at the University of California, Berkeley and Duke University estimated that EV registrations could fall 27% without the tax credit.

Still, history offers an important precedent. The Obama administration was the first to make a big bet on electric cars with limited tax breaks, which were only meant to jump-start the tech before consumers took the lead. And it’s looking like that bet paid off. Electric cars are not fizzling out and consumers want to drive them—and for some, doing so is the cheaper option. We are living in an era where EVs are now interwoven in our collective futures and the technology will continue unabated, even without the White House’s help.",https://atmos.earth/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/EV-tax-breaks-hor-1280x720.jpg,N,,2025-10-15 14:02:46.574493

The Allam-Fetvedt Cycle requires high-purity oxygen separated from air, which is mostly nitrogen and trace amounts of other gases.
If that rises to 30%, the problems associated with fluctuations in wind and solar energy production will be exacerbated, making energy storage critical for overall grid reliability,” Moore said.
“Currently, there’s no large-scale energy storage system on the grid, though research is underway.
“Air separation and liquid oxygen generation have been around for decades.","SAN ANTONIO — October 15, 2025 — Southwest Research Institute (SwRI) and 8 Rivers have patented a system that leverages fluctuations in energy demand by using liquid oxygen storage (LOX) to make power plants more cost-effective and efficient. To accomplish this, the Institute modified a recently developed power cycle, the Allam-Fetvedt Cycle, which combusts fuel, like natural gas, using an oxygen and carbon dioxide mixture to allow complete carbon capture, producing minimal greenhouse gas emissions.

The Allam-Fetvedt Cycle requires high-purity oxygen separated from air, which is mostly nitrogen and trace amounts of other gases. This separation process is energy-intense and consumes 10% of a power plant’s output.

“Our idea is to generate oxygen during off-peak hours, when electricity is less expensive because demand is lower,” said SwRI Institute Engineer Dr. Jeffrey Moore, one of the new system’s inventors. “The oxygen can then be stored in liquid form and then converted back into gas for use in the plant later. This boosts plant output while lowering operating costs.”

To ensure that a power plant utilizing this technology would be profitable, SwRI conducted a techno-economic analysis, modeling both plant performance and hour-by-hour costs over a full year. Studies by Princeton University and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory showed that current price volatility for electricity will continue to increase as more forms of renewable energy come online, indicating that the economic benefits of the application will persist or grow in the future.

“The data show that in some regions prices may stay low for weeks, then spike for long periods, depending on renewable penetration. Right now, the grid is about 10–15% renewables. If that rises to 30%, the problems associated with fluctuations in wind and solar energy production will be exacerbated, making energy storage critical for overall grid reliability,” Moore said. “Currently, there’s no large-scale energy storage system on the grid, though research is underway. This oxygen storage system is one way to effectively store energy, by generating liquid oxygen when power is cheap and using it later when prices are higher.”

The researchers are also considering incorporating it into the Supercritical Transformational Electric Power (STEP) Demo pilot plant at SwRI’s San Antonio headquarters. It’s one of the largest demonstration facilities in the world for supercritical carbon dioxide power generation. Adding LOX and the Allam-Fetvedt cycle to STEP would make it even more fuel-efficient.

“The components of this system are very mature,” Moore said. “Air separation and liquid oxygen generation have been around for decades. That’s what got us to the moon. We’re putting these tested individual pieces together at larger scales, to reach greater heights in clean energy production and improving net present value of the plant.”

The outlook does not include enterprise-owned data centers outside of hyperscale tech giants such as Microsoft, Amazon, Google, and Apple.
Due to the tariff, AEP was able to remove ""the most speculative or uncertain data center projects,"" said a spokesperson.
While demand fell abruptly in Ohio, demand across other states is expected to remain very high.
Meanwhile, Oregon’s data center power demand is expected to exceed 4GW by the end of 2025, up from 3.5GW last year.","According to a forecast from 451 Research, part of S&P Global, utility power provided to hyperscale, leased, and crypto-mining data centers will rise by roughly 11.3GW in 2025 to 61.8GW.

In 2026, US data center demand is projected to rise to 75.8GW for IT equipment, cooling, lighting, and other uses, and expand to 108GW in 2028, and 134.4GW in 2030. The outlook does not include enterprise-owned data centers outside of hyperscale tech giants such as Microsoft, Amazon, Google, and Apple.

Despite forecasting significant demand increases, the forecast notes that some utilities are reporting declining data center interconnection requests. S&P highlights the recent announcement by American Electric Power Ohio (AEP) that it had cut its data center pipeline in half, with demand falling from more than 30GW to 13GW.

The reduction, according to AEP Ohio, was the result of a new data center tariff, approved by the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO) in July, that required data centers to pay for a portion of their energy requests, even if the electricity is not ultimately needed. Due to the tariff, AEP was able to remove ""the most speculative or uncertain data center projects,"" said a spokesperson.

While demand fell abruptly in Ohio, demand across other states is expected to remain very high.

As noted by forecasts from 451 Research, data center electricity demand in Virginia is projected to reach approximately 12.1GW in 2025, up from 9.3GW in 2024.

In Texas, power consumption from data centers is expected to climb to around 9.7GW this year, up from just under 8GW in the previous year, fueled largely by crypto-mining operations and leasing activity.

Meanwhile, Oregon’s data center power demand is expected to exceed 4GW by the end of 2025, up from 3.5GW last year. Other states - including Arizona, Georgia, Ohio, California, Illinois, and Iowa - are projected to record statewide data center demand ranging from 2.3GW to 3.2GW, according to the same analysis.

Reflecting on the report, Stefanie Williams, a senior analyst at 451 Research, said: ""Ample land, reasonable power costs, dense fiber, and demand from hyperscalers continue to drive growth in the state.

""Additionally, we see significant growth in Ohio, particularly around Columbus, where data center operators have clustered for years.""

The report also notes that demand is increasing in several smaller markets, namely, Idaho, Louisiana, Oklahoma, and smaller cities in West Texas. Unlike in more established markets, due to grid limitations, onsite power options have grown in popularity, often centered on areas with ample natural gas supply, such as the Permian Basin in Texas.

""This is largely driven by the search for stranded power and alternative energy generation opportunities,"" Williams said.",https://media.datacenterdynamics.com/media/images/GettyImages-950365224_BAgITcr.2e16d0ba.fill-1200x630.jpg,N,,2025-10-15 14:04:58.672510

According to the Electric School Bus Initiative, Arizona districts had nearly 230 electric school buses committed, but only 49 that either have been delivered or are operating.

But for the portion that was covered by the clean energy tax credits, these federal tax credits, they are hoping to replace with either local sources of funding or state sources of funding.

The Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act allocated money for clean energy vehicles, including electric school buses. It was supposed to last through the end of 2032, but the One Big Beautiful Bill Act ended them at the end of September.

According to the Electric School Bus Initiative, Arizona districts had nearly 230 electric school buses committed, but only 49 that either have been delivered or are operating.

With the tax credit ending, those numbers — both in Arizona and around the country — may not see much increase.

Julia Gentin has covered climate education at The Hechinger Report. She joined The Show to discuss the status of states, districts and schools that were banking on being able to change out some of their bus fleets to electric?

Full conversation

JULIA GENTIN: Well, basically under the Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act, schools were going to be able to have this tax credit for electric vehicles for the next seven years. So, it was set to expire in 2032. But now, under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, or H.R. 1, any electric vehicle that is acquired after September 30 of this year, 2025, will not be eligible for tax credits.

MARK BRODIE: So does that mean that there are likely going to be fewer electric school buses on the roads around the country than districts maybe had thought?

GENTIN: Yeah, for schools that have already purchased their buses but not yet received them, they are going to be OK and they can still continue to receive that tax credit because they've entered into this contract and purchased the buses. But for schools that have had considered for more long term, you know, adding the electric school buses, they will not be able to receive the tax credit if they haven't been purchased by Sept. 30.

BRODIE: Do you have a sense of how many buses or what percentage of electric school buses this might entail, in terms of districts that had been hoping to have them that will not be able to get them because they don't have the tax incentive anymore?

GENTIN: I would say I don't have a number on that, but the amount that it could affect per vehicle from the loss of these tax credits would be about $40,000. So for districts that were considering, or who had these in more of a long-term net zero energy-type resolution, they would not be able to count on federal funding anymore in that form.

BRODIE: What did some of the districts with whom you spoke for your reporting tell you that they planned to do?

GENTIN: Well, I talked to the Los Angeles Unified School District. So this is outside of Arizona, but they were at first really worried because the wording in H.R. 1 had initially been interpreted as ""buses placed into service"" and they weren't supposed to receive buses. They just got a notification that it was going to be before the first quarter of 2026, but they didn't know when they were coming.

So, they were really worried because they had already purchased these buses and were hoping to get the 30% of those costs covered by the Inflation Reduction Act-era tax credits. But then they thought that they couldn't anymore. The good thing is, on Aug. 15, there was sort of a rewording of that because I think the government realized there were a lot of districts in that same situation — where they had ordered the buses, but they hadn't come yet.

And that's something that Sue Gander at the World Resource Institute Electric School Bus Initiative was telling me — that there were a lot of school districts in that same situation that were stressed about when they would, they didn't know when they would get the buses. But luckily, the new Treasury Department guidance said, ""OK, for schools in that situation, as long as you purchase the bus, you'll be OK.""

For Tucson, though, in their school district, they had already gotten — I think — a 10-bus fleet. That was in Nov. 2024. So, that was through funding from the federal government, but a slightly different bucket of funding. It was the Environmental Protection Agency's Clean School Bus Program. But that, for most districts, only covered about two-thirds of the funding, and the remaining one-third was to be covered by this federal tax credit.

BRODIE: What are folks in the advocacy world supporting the adoption of more electric school buses saying about what kind of impact the loss of this tax credit might have?

GENTIN: Well, I think I said before this, but the loss of that tax credit could impact around $40,000 per vehicle. So, that means across the country there are more than half a million buses transporting 21 million kids to school. And there are all sorts of environmental impacts that come with these diesel- or fossil-fueled buses.

So, the hope was that the transition could continue, but now it's more of like, telling districts, ""you have to get these buses as soon as possible; otherwise, you won't be able to receive tax credits for them and you won't be able to electrify your fleet."" So, I think it will delay a lot of the electrification processes and the majority — this 90% of fossil fuel diesel school buses — will continue operating.

BRODIE: Does it seem as though advocates think this really is just a delay and not sort of the ending of this effort to electrify fleets?

GENTIN: It seems like districts still have hope and advocates still have hope that there could be some other funding sources that they look to to fill that gap. However, the Environmental Protection Agency's Clean School Bus Program, I believe, is expiring in two years. So that's, that's another setback. But for the portion that was covered by the clean energy tax credits, these federal tax credits, they are hoping to replace with either local sources of funding or state sources of funding.

But some states are more fortunate than others. For example, California has a lot of resources to fund electric school buses and electric vehicles, but some other states just don't have those resources.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/596f246/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5150x2704+0+1243/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fd7%2F56%2Fd190939e4f8fb5bf7fdad76d2634%2Fjulia-gentin-20251014.jpeg,N,,2025-10-15 13:09:06.946350

Enrollees can claim this refundable credit in full even if they have little to no tax liability.

The PTC is also advanceable (referred to as the Advance Premium Tax Credit, or APTC) to reduce up-front premium costs, as consumers can choose to have the APTC automatically applied to monthly health insurance premiums.i When taken as an APTC, the credit is paid directly to the insurer.

Figure 1: How Do PTCs and Enhanced PTCs Work?

Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, Congress passed the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (ARPA), which temporarily expanded the populations eligible for these tax credits and the amount of financial assistance provided for two years. Under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA), Congress extended these so-called enhanced PTCs (also known as enhanced Advance Premium Tax Credits, or eAPTCs) through December 31, 2025.

Congress now faces a set of difficult choices with significant implications for the federal deficit, the number of insured Americans, and the financial burden insurance imposes on consumers.

With expiration approaching, Congress could:

permanently extend enhanced PTCs at current levels;

allow the enhanced PTCs to expire (and revert to standard PTC levels);

temporarily extend the enhanced PTCs for a limited duration; or

modify eligibility criteria or the size of the enhanced PTCs.ii

Any policy action—or inaction—is likely to impact both the federal deficit and marketplace rates for 2026. Insurers’ proposed rate filings indicate that individual market premiums will increase approximately 18% in 2026, up from the 7% increase proposed last year, although the actual increase that will take effect January 1, 2026, will likely differ.iii[1]

This issue brief addresses: (1) PTCs and subsequent changes, (2) populations that would be significantly affected if the enhanced PTCs expire, (3) the various options to reform the enhanced PTCs, and (4) recent policy proposals, including available cost and coverage impacts.

Premium Tax Credits and Subsequent Changes

Premium Tax Credits include several features that were temporarily enhanced under ARPA and extended under the IRA through the end of 2025.ivv The enhanced PTCs temporarily expanded eligibility for premium subsidies to individuals with incomes above 400% of the federal poverty line (FPL) and increased the available subsidies.vi See Figure 2.

(Permanent Law) Enhanced PTC

(Temporary Changes from PTC) Eligibility

Eligibility for premium assistance is limited to households with incomes between 100% and 400% of FPL (or up to $62,600 for a single adult and $128,600 for a household of four in 2025), among other requirements.

The eligibility cutoff at 400% of FPL is often referred to as the “subsidy cliff.”

The previous eligibility limit of up to 400% of FPL is temporarily eliminated, allowing households with incomes above 400% of FPL to qualify for the subsidies.

This temporarily eliminates the “subsidy cliff.”

Income-based, Sliding Scale Subsidies

Enrollees pay a sliding-scale share of their income toward a benchmark “silver” plan premium.

No change.

Maximum Share of Income that Individuals Are Required to Contribute

The sliding-scale share rises with income, from about 2% of income (for households up to 133% of FPL) up to 9.5% of income (for households at 400% of FPL).

People with incomes under 150% of FPL have zero or near-zero premiums.

Households do not pay more than 8.5% of income for the benchmark silver plan premium.

Absent congressional action, the enhanced PTCs will sunset in December 2025, with coverage reverting to the less generous pre‑ARPA PTC schedule. See Figure 4.

Most recently, in July 2025, Congress passed reconciliation legislation (H.R. 1) that contained several enhanced PTC-related changes (but with no change to enhanced PTCs’ expiration date). These legislated changes followed related regulatory changes in the June 2025 Marketplace Integrity and Affordability Final Rule issued by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). Taken together, H.R. 1 and the Marketplace Integrity Rule tighten enrollment and administrative requirements, limiting access to enhanced PTCs and reducing the number of consumers who can claim the credits.vii Relevant provisions in H.R. 1 and CMS’s recent regulation are outlined in Figure 3.

Figure 3: Key Changes to Premium Subsidies under H.R. 1 and the 2025 Marketplace Integrity Rule

H.R. 1viii 2025 Marketplace Integrity Ruleix

Ends automatic reenrollment.

Ends eligibility for APTC pending verification.

Disallows PTC for income-based special enrollment period (SEP).

Eliminates caps on recapture of APTC.

Limits eligibility for subsidized marketplace coverage for certain immigrants.

Treats all bronze and catastrophic plans as high-deductible health plans.

Restricts marketplace tax credits for persons denied Medicaid due to work requirements.

Establishes new agent/broker standards (e.g., consumer consent requirements and stronger CMS enforcement authority).

Prohibits gender-affirming care as an essential health benefit.

Shortens annual enrollment period (2027).

Allows coverage denial for failure to pay premiums for prior coverage.

Revises automatic reenrollment hierarchy.

Rescinds Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients’ eligibility for PTCs.

Ends 60-day auto-extension for resolving data matching issues.

Adjusts actuarial value rules and de minimis thresholds.

Establishes more rigorous income verification (2026).

Requires pre-enrollment verification for SEP eligibility (2026).

Pauses year-round SEP for persons with incomes ≤150% of FPL (2026).

Ends automatic reenrollment in $0 premium plans (2026).

Eliminates fixed-dollar and gross percentage-based premium payment thresholds (2026).

Ends APTC for failure to file and reconcile (also codified in H.R. 1).

Many of these changes respond to concerns related to potential improper payment of premium tax credits.

By design, advance payment of the tax credit requires enrollees to make a good-faith effort to project how much money they will make in the year to come, as this estimate determines the size of the tax credit. As discussed in the Bipartisan Policy Center’s 2024 article, “Paying the 2025 Tax Bill: Health Care Improper Payments,” projecting income is particularly difficult for people with fluctuating incomes due to tenuous attachments to the workforce, the vagaries of hourly and/or seasonal jobs, or working in the gig economy.x

The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that 1.3 million marketplace enrollees improperly claimed the tax credit for 2023 and an estimated 2.3 million enrollees did so for 2025, based on enrollment data demonstrating an unusual concentration of enrollees reporting income just above the FPL.xi

CMS’s recent regulatory changes have drawn several ongoing court challenges, reflecting disagreement over the agency’s authority to regulate ACA marketplaces. In August 2025, a federal judge paused implementation of parts of the Marketplace Rule, following a challenge brought by the cities of Chicago and Baltimore. The cities argued that the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) violated the Administrative Procedure Act and that parts of the Marketplace Rule violate the ACA.xii

Estimated Impact of Enhanced PTCs’ Expiration

Health insurance enrollment through ACA marketplaces reached 24.3 million in 2025, more than double the 11.4 million who were enrolled in 2020.xiii About 22.4 million enrollees (92%) received advance payments of the enhanced premium tax credit in 2025.xiv

Expiration of the enhanced PTCs will increase premiums for these individuals and their families, with the size of the increase varying based on income, household size, and location. Higher premiums will especially affect several key populations, including individuals under age 55; older adults with incomes above 400% of FPL; individuals and families with low (up to 150% of FPL) and middle incomes (400%-500% of FPL); populations with higher uninsurance risk; and individuals and families in rural areas.xvxvi

Younger, Healthier Individuals Could Exit the Marketplace. Since Congress established the enhanced PTCs, individuals under age 55 have accounted for an increasing portion of open enrollment period plan selections through the marketplace.xviii At the same time, the portion of older adults ages 55+ has decreased from 30% of marketplace participants in 2020 to 24% in 2025.xix See Figure 6.

Accordingly, enhanced PTCs have been credited with making ACA coverage more affordable and bringing more people, including healthier or lower-cost enrollees, into the marketplace.xxxxi These trends also align with CBO’s estimate that permanent extension of the enhanced PTCs would lower gross premiums for benchmark plans by 7.6% on average in each year from 2026-2035 due to an expected healthier risk pool.xxii

Given the surge in marketplace enrollment following enhanced PTC implementation, it is reasonable to assume that enhanced PTCs have enabled more people to get health care.xxiiixxiv Studies have documented these ACA-related increases, particularly in primary and preventive care visits, while early ARPA-period surveys have demonstrated improved access to and uptake of routine services.xxvxxvi This uptake then, in turn, can both help prevent and manage costly chronic diseases.xxviixxviii

Older adults (ages 50-64) with incomes above 400% of FPL. Marketplace plan premiums increase significantly with age, as a 64-year-old pays three times more for coverage than younger adults ages 21-24 in most states.xxix This means that expiration of the enhanced PTCs will disproportionately affect older adults who earn just above the pre-ARPA PTC income eligibility limit of 400% of FPL. For example, a 60-year-old couple with an annual income at 402% of FPL (about $85,000) could pay a yearly premium of $22,600 in 2026, or about a quarter of their annual income, instead of 8.5% of their income (as established under enhanced PTCs).xxx

Individuals and families with low and middle incomes. As 45% of all enrollees (or 10.9 million people) with OEP plan selections had incomes between 100% and 150% of FPL in 2025, many of these individuals could see their premiums increase from $0 in 2025 up to 4% of income (for those at the top of the income range) in 2026 upon expiration of the enhanced PTCs. For example, a family of four with a household income of $45,000 (140% of FPL) with a $0 premium in 2025 will see their premiums increase to $1,607 a year. See Figure 7.

Similarly, an analysis by the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) in coordination with CBO showed that extension of the enhanced PTCs would disproportionately benefit individuals and families with incomes between $100,000 and $150,000.xxxi For example, a family of four with a household income of $110,000 could see an increase of $3,201 in their annual premium payment in 2026, with the premium reaching 10% of the family’s income ($10,956) instead of 7.1% ($7,755).xxxii See Figure 7.

Individuals and families with incomes above 400% of FPL will also see significant premium increases absent the enhanced PTCs. Moreover, almost 725,000 individuals and families with incomes between 400% and 500% of FPL (or 4% of marketplace enrollees) will no longer be eligible to receive the PTC following the expiration of the enhanced PTCs.xxxiii One estimate finds that average premiums for this population with a household income over 400% of FPL (or over $62,600 for an individual and $128,600 for a family of four in 2025) will increase by more than $2,900 per year if the enhanced PTCs expire.xxxiv

FPL stands for Federal Poverty Level. Required contribution percentages refer to the maximum share of income ACA Marketplace enrollees are required to pay for a benchmark plan. The “2026 Tax Credits” scenario represents the required contribution percentages that will be in place for 2026 if enhanced tax credits are not renewed. Premium increases will vary for enrollees with incomes over 400% of poverty based on family size, age, and location.

Small businesses and gig workers. The Department of the Treasury’s Office of Tax Analysis estimated that, in 2022, over 2.7 million (or 82%) of self-employed workers and small-business owners claimed the PTC, including about 285,000 taxpayers with incomes over 400% of FPL.xxxvi

Similarly, an analysis from KFF estimates that almost half of adult enrollees in the individual health insurance market (the majority of which is purchased through marketplaces) are small-business owners, employees, or self-employed workers, and certain occupations are particularly reliant on individual market coverage.xxxvii

These occupations in which at least a quarter of adult workers relied on individual market coverage in 2023 included chiropractors (34%) and dentists (26%); real estate brokers and sales agents (28%); and farmers, ranchers, and agricultural managers (27%).xxxviii

Populations with high uninsurance risk. Certain populations with a higher uninsurance risk, including Black and Latino consumers, will be disproportionately impacted by the expiration of the enhanced PTCs.xxxixxlAlthough these populations are still substantially more likely to be uninsured compared with other populations, they have seen significant gains in recent years that have helped to reduce coverage disparities.

Between 2020 and 2024, HealthCare.gov plan selections increased by over 200% among Black consumers and by 185% among Latinos, according to HHS’s assistant secretary for planning and evaluation (ASPE).xli CMS data similarly shows that the percentage of total consumers with OEP plan selections increased among Hispanics/Latinos from 18% in 2020 to 22% in 2025 and Blacks from 8% in 2020 to 10% in 2025.xlii

Although these populations still account for a smaller portion of marketplace consumers compared with white consumers (52% in 2025), recent coverage gains could be lost if the enhanced PTCs expire.xliii

Individuals and families in rural areas. Among the 17.1 million consumers who enrolled through HealthCare.gov in 2025, 3.1 million (or 18.1%) were in rural areas.xlivxlv These individuals disproportionately benefit from the enhanced PTCs compared with their urban counterparts. An HHS study found that the enhanced PTCs saved enrollees in rural areas an average of $890 per year in 2024, about 28% more than their urban counterparts.xlvi

Some estimates project that most rural states will experience, on average, a 30% decrease in marketplace coverage and a 37% increase in uninsured populations if the enhanced PTCs expire, as premiums could increase from $760 up to $3,000 or more in rural areas.xlviixlviii

Key Policy Levers for Adjusting Enhanced PTCs

When assessing reform options, Congress can consider adjusting the enhanced PTCs’ sunset date, changing the income eligibility limit, adjusting the maximum share of income that individuals are required to contribute toward the premium, and enacting paused provisions of the 2025 Marketplace Integrity Rule.xlixlPolicymakers can also consider a combination of these policy levers.

Adjust the sunset date: Extend the enhanced PTCs (e.g., permanently or for 1, 2, 3, 5, or 10 years), either with no change to eligibility or premium contribution levels or with some modifications. See Figure 8 for available data on the cost of various extension options and the coverage effects. An extension could include grandfathering existing enhanced PTC recipients but eliminating or restricting eligibility for enhanced PTCs in future years.

Adjust income eligibility: If extending the enhanced PTC, Congress can consider restoring the PTC income eligibility limit of 400% of FPL or establishing an income limit at some percentage above 400% of FPL. This option could include establishing and gradually phasing down an income eligibility limit for enhanced PTCs to prior PTC levels.

Adjust the maximum share of income that individuals are required to contribute toward the premium: If extending the enhanced PTC, Congress could gradually ratchet up the cap on the maximum percentage of household income that individuals are required to contribute toward the premium.

Target individuals with incomes at 400%+ of FPL: For example, extending two years, in 2027, increase the cap from 8.5% to 9% of income for an individual with an income at 400%+ of FPL.

Target restriction or elimination of $0 premiums for individuals with low incomes: Some policymakers have recently suggested ensuring that individuals have “skin in the game” by eliminating $0 premiums to address program integrity concerns that some enrollees may have been automatically enrolled and are unaware that they have coverage.li For example, Congress could increase the cap from 0% to 1% for some portion of individuals with incomes up to 150% of FPL.

Enact paused provisions of the 2025 Marketplace Integrity Rule through legislation: As discussed above, legal challenges have paused implementation of certain provisions of the 2025 Marketplace Integrity Rule, including shortened annual enrollment; rescinding of eligibility for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients; SEP eligibility verification and ending enrollment in $0 premium plans. Policymakers desiring implementation of certain provisions impacting enhanced PTCs could overcome these legal challenges by enacting the provisions into law.

The CBO baseline assumes the expiration of the enhanced PTC as provided for in current law. Permanently extending the enhanced PTCs would increase the federal deficit by $350 billion from 2026-2035 and the number of people with health insurance by 3.8 million in 2035, according to CBO.lii See Figure 8.

In recent months, some members of Congress have introduced legislation, including bipartisan legislation, to extend the enhanced PTCs for one to two years. These bills include the following:

R. 5145, the Bipartisan Premium Tax Credit Extension Act. Introduced by Rep. Jennifer Kiggans (R-VA), with 13 Republican and 10 Democratic cosponsors, this bill would extend enhanced PTCs for one year through December 31, 2026.

2824, a bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to extend the temporary enhanced premium credits.

Figure 8: Policy Options for Extension of Enhanced PTCs and Available Cost and Coverage Impacts (CBO and JCT Estimates)

Policy Options Policy Details Federal Deficit Impact Coverage Impact Permanent extension Congress makes enhanced PTCs permanent (as established under ARPA and extended under IRA). Increases the federal deficit by $349.8 billion from 2026–2035, with the financial benefits primarily reaching individuals with incomes from $15K–$30K and $100K–$150K.liii

Similarly, an earlier CBO and JCT estimate (2024) found that about half of the increase in enrollment and 69% of the total cost of the premium tax credit for people who enrolled because of a permanent extension would be for people with income below 400% of FPL, and 31% ($113 billion) would be for those with incomes at or above 400% of FPL.liv

Increases the number of insured by 3.8 million in 2035.lv One-year extension (2026) Congress extends current enhanced PTCs to December 31, 2026.

Proposed legislation: H.R. 5145, Bipartisan Premium Tax Credit Extension Act.

Increases the federal deficit by $23.4 billion in 2026, with the financial benefits primarily reaching individuals with incomes under $200K.lvi Increases the number of insured by 2 million by 2026.lvii Two-year extension (2026–2027) Congress extends enhanced PTCs to December 31, 2027.

Proposed legislation: S. 2824, a bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to extend the temporary enhanced premium credits.

Increases the federal deficit by $55.3 billion from 2026–2027.lviii Increases the number of insured by 3.5 million by 2027.lix Three-year extension (2026–2028) Congress extends enhanced PTCs to December 31, 2028. Increases the federal deficit by $85.7 billion.lx Increases the number of insured by 3.7 million by 2028.lxi

Conclusion

Congress faces challenging decisions that will have major implications for both the private insurance market and federal deficits. As Congress considers a path forward on the expiring enhanced PTCs, any bipartisan agreement should balance stabilizing coverage and maintaining fiscal sustainability by offsetting costs associated with any potential extension of the enhanced PTCs.lxii

Notably, among these, implementing site neutral payments in Medicare could reduce federal deficits by $157 billion between 2026 and 2034, according to CBO.

Union commerce secretary Rajesh Agarwal, who left for Washington on Wednesday to join the negotiations for the bilateral trade agreement (BTA) with the US, said that India is open to increasing its crude and gas imports from the US if prices remain viable for domestic refiners.

India, on average, imports $12–13 billion worth of crude oil and gas from the US every year. There is headroom for an additional $12–13 billion in purchases without requiring any changes to refinery configurations, he said, adding that India will consider buying more energy products, keeping in view the cost dynamics.

“Our team is currently in the US, holding discussions with American counterparts on energy trade and related cooperation,” Agarwal said on the sidelines of a press conference held to announce the monthly trade data.

The Indian team will hold trade pact discussions with their counterparts till 17 October.

His comments come against the backdrop of the US decision to impose an additional 25% tariff on India’s exports for buying Russian oil, a measure that is expected to sharply raise costs for Indian refiners and complicate New Delhi’s energy diversification strategy. Indian exports to the US now face 50% tariffs.

“To secure a deal, India may eventually have to halt its imports of Russian oil unless the US court strikes down the current levy. The earlier price discounts on Russian crude are no longer available, and with the narrowing price gap, India’s purchases of Russian oil are likely to taper off in the coming months,” said Ajay Srivastava, co-founder, Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI), a think-tank.

The US has said that India's purchases of Russian oil fuel Moscow's war against Ukraine.

Earlier, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on 10 October that India is expected to begin shifting its energy imports, reducing purchases of Russian oil.

Bessent had said, “Do you think, in your estimation, you've run all the numbers, would this war be possible now, were it not for China and India's involvement in those purchases? Absolutely not. So they're keeping the war going.”

Mint reported on 25 September that the US has asked India to give an assurance, possibly in writing, that it will taper its purchases of Russian oil and boost imports of American crude before a trade deal between the two nations can be finalised.

Energy imports have become the main sticking point in the ongoing talks, which are being steered by US trade representative (USTR) Jamieson Greer, and not by commerce secretary Howard Lutnick.

The Indian negotiating team is also expected to discuss other contentious issues such as agriculture, dairy, genetically modified (GM) crops, and non-tariff barriers during the talks. The US has been insisting on deeper market access for its agricultural and dairy exports, areas that remain a red line for India.

India’s state-owned refiners reduced purchases of Russian oil by more than 45% between June and September this year, according to data from Kpler. The data show that refiners imported around 600,000 barrels per day (bpd) of oil from Russia in September, a significant decline from about 1.1 million bpd in June.

Historically, Russia wasn't India's primary source of crude oil. After Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, India ramped up its oil imports from a negligible 0.2% of total imports to 35–40%, saving an estimated $17 billion through discounted purchases.

India has also signaled its willingness to make concessions amid the ongoing trade tensions by waiving the 11% duty on cotton imports until the end of the year, in what is seen as a gesture towards the United States.

As per the commerce ministry data, bilateral trade between India and the US stood at $71.41 billion in H1 FY26, up by 11.8% from $63.89 billion in H1 FY25. Exports to the US grew by 13.4%, rising from $40.42 billion in H1 FY25 to $45.82 billion, while imports increased by 9% from $23.47 billion to $25.59 billion.

A performance-based grant of $125,000 from the One North Carolina Fund will help the company locate to North Carolina.
We look forward to a long and successful future for JudCo Manufacturing here in Greene County.” “Thank you, Judco Manufacturing, for choosing North Carolina for your new home,” said Representative Chris Humphrey.","Today Governor Josh Stein announced Judco Manufacturing, Inc., an automotive supplier, will create 60 new jobs in Greene County. The company will invest more than $5.3 million to move its headquarters and research and development operations to Snow Hill.

“I am excited to welcome Judco Manufacturing to Greene County,” said Governor Stein. “When companies that have a global footprint are looking for growth opportunities, North Carolina will continue to be the clear choice because of our manufacturing strength across all industries, our talented workforce, and our well-connected transportation network.”

Judco Manufacturing, Inc. is a third-generation, family-owned company that manufactures precision electromechanical components serving OEM and Tier 1 customers in the automotive, appliance, and industrial markets. Celebrating more than 50 years in business, Judco has a strong reputation for quality, reliability, and excellence in engineering, offering early-stage design, final assembly, and high-volume fulfillment services. The company specializes in custom-designed pushbutton switches, wire harnesses, and injection-molded plastic components used in high-demand applications where performance and durability are critical. Judco will make a 50,000-square-foot facility the new home for its corporate, engineering, and production functions.

“Relocating Judco Manufacturing’s headquarters and R&D operations to Greene County is a major milestone in our company’s growth,” said Kurt George, President and CEO of Judco Manufacturing. “North Carolina offers the right combination of workforce, infrastructure, and business climate to help us innovate and stay competitive in a rapidly changing automotive market. We are proud to invest here and look forward to building a long-term partnership with the community.”

“There are more than 170 million customers within a day’s drive of eastern North Carolina,” said Commerce Secretary Lee Lilley. “With 20 of the top 100 OEM automotive suppliers calling our state home, Judco Manufacturing is in great company, and North Carolina is committed to providing the workforce training systems that will help develop the talent they need for today and tomorrow.”

Although wages will vary, the average annual salary for the new positions will be $44,001, exceeding the Greene County average wage of $39,698. These new jobs could potentially create an annual payroll impact of more than $2.6 million for the region.

A performance-based grant of $125,000 from the One North Carolina Fund will help the company locate to North Carolina. The OneNC Fund provides financial assistance to local governments to help attract economic investment and to create jobs. Companies receive no money upfront and must meet job creation and capital investment targets to qualify for payment. All OneNC grants require matching participation from local governments, and any award is contingent upon that condition being met.

“North Carolina’s pro-growth and low tax policies along with our highly skilled and motivated workforce are paying off for Eastern North Carolina,” said Senator Buck Newton. “The investment and the jobs created by JudCo Manufacturing will strengthen our local economy and provide more opportunities. We look forward to a long and successful future for JudCo Manufacturing here in Greene County.”

“Thank you, Judco Manufacturing, for choosing North Carolina for your new home,” said Representative Chris Humphrey. “We welcome these new jobs and investments to Snow Hill and look forward to helping the company build a bright future for many years to come.”

60% The Department of Energy Pulls the Plug on Some EV Projects It’s not been an easy time for any EV manufacturer in the United States.
Of course, the Inflation Reduction Act’s promises, including the EV tax credit, may have been the most visible on the chopping block, but there are other changes, too.
This is not great news, especially for automakers that desperately need the cash to help offset the great losses from EV sales and manufacturing.
100% Did You Cash In On the EV Tax Credit?","It’s now a post-electric-forward world here in the United States, and that means that a lot of programs and tax incentives for EVs have been straight-up cancelled. That meant a surge of electric buyers while those offers lasted, but unsurprisingly, some brands did much better than others.

Welcome back to Critical Materials, your morning roundup of industry and technology news. Today, we’re talking about some big EV projects slated for loss of funding from the U.S. Department of Energy, but also the winners and losers in terms of EV sales before tax credits officially collapsed. Meanwhile, in China, Polestar has officially closed its last store—what's next for the brand there?

30% EV Registrations Surge Before IRA Ends

Photo by: InsideEVs

It’s officially over, folks. The IRA tax credit is done and gone for, but before it ended, lots of EV buyers rushed to cash in before the tax credit evaporated entirely.

The tax credits ended in September, but it always takes a few weeks for new car registration data to trickle in. Now, we have a sense of the winners and losers in August. EV registrations were up a whopping 24% that month, but not all models were equally loved, according to reporting from Automotive News.

Mainstream brands won big, while luxury brands were fairly ignored. The Honda Prologue was one of the biggest winners, but on the backs of heavy incentives. Emphasis mine below:

The Honda Prologue was among August’s biggest winners as registrations jumped 81 percent to 9,005 vehicles. The Prologue was the No. 3 most-popular EV for the month after the Tesla Model Y crossover and Model 3 sedan, S&P Global Mobility said.

Registration data serve as a proxy for sales because some EV makers don’t separate U.S. results or report sales by model. Many automakers also don’t report sales monthly.

The Prologue came with incentives of $12,704 per vehicle in August, compared with $5,813 a year earlier, Motor Intelligence said. In contrast, Honda’s gasoline-powered CR-V crossover had $2,016 in August incentives, the data provider said.

The real information here is that buyers are clearly shopping on price. Buyers want a cheap car, and the Prologue has some of the best incentives and deals to get drivers behind the wheel. Likewise, cars like the Hyundai Ioniq 5 also have strong pricing incentives to get buyers in the door. But that's a lot of cash on the hood to get people to buy a Honda EV, for example.

Also up: the Tesla Model Y, Chevrolet's EVs and the Ioniq 5. Down: Cadillac Lyriq didn’t see all that much growth, partially because of the brand’s incentive cut for that model, the Tesla Model 3 (people may just be buying the SUV instead) and the Cybertruck.

I think going forward, the U.S. EV market will likely continue to fall along lines of price. So, cars like the new Chevrolet Bolt, Nissan Leaf or updated Hyundai Ioniq 5 will likely continue to be winners for most consumers—and hopefully more cheap options are on their way.

60% The Department of Energy Pulls the Plug on Some EV Projects

It’s not been an easy time for any EV manufacturer in the United States.

Since President Trump has taken office, EVs and clean energy have become incredibly politicized. Of course, the Inflation Reduction Act’s promises, including the EV tax credit, may have been the most visible on the chopping block, but there are other changes, too. The Department of Energy isn’t too fond of EV manufacturing or clean energy, and it’s been slashing funding once awarded to big companies to make new stuff. In fact, it’s taken the axe to 233 projects that it’s dubbed part of “the left’s climate agenda.”

That includes big projects and awards for General Motors and Stellantis. A whopping $500 million for GM to convert a manufacturing facility to EV is now gone. Likewise, a $335 million grant for Stellantis to do something similar at its Belvidere, Ill. plant is also gone. The worst part is, that nothing has officially been confirmed, but just ascertained via a list that fell into the hands of journalists, analysts and politicians.

There are two lists, the second of which has the cancellations from Stellantis and GM. From Automotive News:

A day later, the department said in a news release that the DOE terminated 321 financial awards supporting 223 projects totaling $7.56 billion.

“Following a thorough, individualized financial review, DOE determined that these projects did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs, were not economically viable, and would not provide a positive return on investment of taxpayer dollars,” it said.

Analysts told Automotive News that the Department of Energy did not release the first list of terminated projects. However, the news outlet Latitude Media obtained the list and published it online.

That first list of terminated projects includes investments in hydrogen, industrial decarbonization and transmission and distribution of electricity.

Days later, the second list appeared.

This is not great news, especially for automakers that desperately need the cash to help offset the great losses from EV sales and manufacturing. Unfortunately, it doesn’t seem like the Trump Administration is all that interested in making sure the U.S.’s manufacturing stays globally competitive, instead opting to mire itself in weirdly partisan politics. We're in for a strange couple of years.

90% Polestar Closes Up Shop in China (Sort Of)

Polestar certainly hasn’t fared all that well in China. That’s interesting, the brand has started to find its roots globally, increasing sales in European and American markets, but it’s been a non-starter in China. Just a few weeks ago, we reported on how it closed all of its stores but one, and had a dismal 69 cars sold in China for the whole first half of the year.

Well, it looks like Polestar is kind of done in China. It’s shifting to an entirely online business model, and it has closed its last store, once located in Shanghai. Oof. From CarNewsChina:

Polestar officially closed its final direct sales store in the Chinese market. The store was located at L+Plaza in Qiantan, Shanghai, according to Auto-home. The company stated that this move is part of a strategic adjustment to its China business model. It emphasized that other operations in the country, as well as customer rights, remain unaffected. Polestar now primarily sells its vehicles through online channels.

Now, Polestar still has more models coming for the rest of the world. The Polestar 5, as well as the Geely-based Polestar 7 are still on the way, even if they won’t make their debut in China. Polestar still exists in China, and is very much a part of China's Geely group—but it looks like the brand is pivoting to focus more on its successes elsewhere across the globe.

This surge is fuelled by the aggressive expansion of Chinese manufacturers, who dominate the market. The largest 25 manufacturers tracked by Enerdata show combined PV modules shipments increasing from 172 GW in 2021 to 687 GW in 2024, a 300% increase in 4 years1.

For several years, the Chinese companies have been dominating the manufacturing and supply of solar panels with only 1 or 2 maximum of non-Chinese companies make it to the list of 10 manufacturers. In 2024, the top 10 companies by modules shipment stayed unchanged compared to 2023, with some players trading placed. The top four players sustained their positions from 2023 while growing their overall shipments. Jinko Solar maintains its 1st place with shipments increasing from 79 GW to 93 GW, followed by Longi, which increased its shipments from 68 GW to 78 GW. Both Trina Solar and JA Solar share the 3rd place with shipments of 77 GW each. Canadian Solar retreated from the 5th position in 2023 to the 7th place in 2024 with an identical shipment volume of 31 GW in both years. TW Solar (Tongwei) and Astronergy (Chint) moved up to the 5th and 6th places with 49 GW and 40 GW module shipments, respectively. GCL (25 GW), Risen Energy (25 GW), and DAS Solar (23 GW) completed the top 10 by modules shipments.

Figure 2: Historical Modules Shipments in GW

The top 10 achieved an average shipment volume increase of 27% between 2023 and 2024, except for Risen Energy, whose shipments decreased by 4%. The highest annual shipment increase is achieved by TW Solar (+69%), followed by GCL (+52%) and Astronergy (+43%). Beyond the top 10 by modules shipments, other notable manufacturers achieved significant shipments in 2024, such as Yingli (20 GW), DMEGC (17 GW), First Solar (14 GW), and Seraphim (12 GW). The shipments of the following companies are below the 10 GW threshold 1.

As of total market share based on PV modules shipments, Jinko Solar leads with 13%, followed by Longi, Trina solar, and JA Solar, each with around 11%. The next tier includes TW solar (7%), Astronergy (6%), Canadian solar (5%), GCL and Risen Solar (4%), and DAS Solar (3%). Beyond the top 10, notable manufacturers include Yingli (3%), DMEGC (2%), First Solar (2%), Seraphim (2%), while the remaining 16% (107 GW) is held by other manufacturers.

Figure 3: PV Modules Shipment & Market Share (GW; 2024)

The industry is growing rapidly, and operational production capacity is expanding accordingly. In addition to existing capacity, numerous players are planning or constructing large-scale production facilities, continually increasing their output and diversifying their manufacturing base across several countries—a strategy likely aimed at overcoming trade barriers. For example, Jinko is planning a 3 GW solar module production facility in Vietnam, as well as a 10 GW cell and module facility in Saudi Arabia. Similarly, JA Solar has announced a 3 GW facility in Oman and a 2 GW facility in Egypt, while Longi is developing a 1.6 GW facility in Indonesia, among others 2&3.

In 2024, the top 10 manufacturers by module shipments collectively reached over 805 GW of production capacity, with combined module shipments amounting to 517 GW. This resulted in a 65% utilisation rate, which, despite appearing low, represents an improvement compared to 2023, when the utilisation rate for the same top 10 manufacturers was 59%. The highest utilisation rate in 2024 was achieved by GCL (83%), followed by Trina Solar and JA Solar (77%). The lowest utilisation rates were recorded by Canadian Solar and Longi, both with 52%. Notably, Canadian Solar added 3 GW of production capacity while maintaining the same shipment volume as in 2023. Longi significantly expanded its production capacity by 30 GW (+25%) in 2024, though its module shipments grew by only 15% compared to 2023. Longi remains the largest manufacturer in terms of production capacity with 150 GW, followed by Jinko Solar with 130 GW.

Figure 4: PV Modules Production Capacity, Shipment & Utilisation Factor (GW; 2024)

As competition intensifies, profit margins are shrinking for most key players, who struggle to maintain healthy profitability while simultaneously investing in R&D and production expansion. Continuous price declines and aggressive competition restrict companies’ ability to manoeuvre and balance their finances. In 2024, Zhejiang Akcome Photoelectricity Technology filed for bankruptcy, citing an inability to meet debt obligations4 .

With average selling prices for utility-scale modules hitting historic lows—dropping to $0.08–$0.10 per watt— manufacturers across the board felt a severe margin squeeze5 . One source reports that the top 10 module manufacturers suffered combined losses of $4 billion in 2024, amid year-over-year revenue declines. A recent report employed the Altman Z-Score6 , according to which six of the top 10 manufacturers—including Jinko, Longi, Trina, Astronergy, TW Solar, and JA Solar—fell into the grey zone, showing worsening financial health compared to the previous year, with the exception of Jinko, which improved its score in 2024.

Focusing on the largest players, the top five manufacturers experienced significant revenue declines in 2024 versus 2023, despite increased module shipments. Furthermore, all top five companies reported substantial losses in 2024, contrasting with their positive earnings or smaller losses in the prior year7.

Jinko Solar reported an operating loss of -$0.47 billion while revenues were $12.64 billion down 22.3%, gross profit $1.37 billion, down 47.4% and gross margin of 10.9% down 5.1%8. Longi’s revenue hit $11.5 billion down 37%, net loss $1.3 billion compared to profit of $1.75 billion and a growth margin 7.4%9 . Trina made a revenue of $11.15 billion a decrease 30%, loss of -$0.26 billion compared to earnings of 2023 of $1.10 billion10 . JA Solar gained a revenue of $9.7 billion a decrease 18%, loss of -$0.65 billion compared to $1 billion earnings in 202311. Tongwei achieved a revenue of $12.8, a decrease of 51%, loss of - $1.2 billion compared to losses of - $1 billion in 202312.

Reshuffling production bases

The market continues to feature a rapid cycle of innovation and technology deployment with technologies like TOPCon, HJT, and IBC achieving higher efficiency compared to older technologies13. Companies invest considerable amounts on innovation and new technologies to ensure their survival in the competition landscape. Some estimates put industry average R&D investments at 4%14. However, these investments increase financial pressure with only marginal impact on the market. Coupled with overcapacity and continuous expansion, this creates downward price pressure, leading to fierce competition for market share at the expense of profitability. Meanwhile, the market actually seeks standardised, certified, mass-produced, and stable modules.

Striking this fine balance between these different dynamics is what differentiates successful companies. For the European market, brands must not only provide efficient modules but also meet stringent regulations, be responsive to local EPCs, and participate in public tenders, with failure to do so raising project complexity. Furthermore, European and American markets are gradually transitioning to favour locally produced components, with considerable strategies advocating local production increasing barriers on imports. These two markets still see locally produced modules prices higher than Chinese imported modules, even after levies and import taxes. This is attributed to the extensive integration of the Chinese solar industry value chain, the massive production scale, and the size of local demand in China, which absorbs a considerable percentage of the production.

Europe and the USA Manufacturing Evolution

Escalating trade wars—particularly between the USA and China—have introduced trade barriers and increased import levies. Moreover, growing concerns over supply risks and trade imbalances that could be weaponised as political leverage have contributed to a resurgence of local solar manufacturing. Both Europe and the USA have announced substantial new solar PV production capacities. At the same time, Chinese companies have dispersed some of their new production facilities across multiple countries to circumvent trade barriers targeting Chinese products.

The Net Zero Industry Act (NZIA) sets an ambitious target for the European Union: achieving 30 GW of domestic solar photovoltaic (PV) manufacturing capacity across the entire value chain by 2030. Building this capacity represents a significant challenge. According to Enerdata, the EU currently operates around 60 plants producing PV modules, with a combined manufacturing capacity of 8.4 GW. However, over the past two years, approximately 2.4 GW of capacity has been shut down, and an additional 2.7 GW has been put on hold15.

Despite these setbacks, more than 50 GW of additional PV module manufacturing capacity has been announced for completion by 2030. Notable projects include AE Solar in Romania, Siliconvalen in Spain, and Holosolis in France. Furthermore, around 20 GW of ingot and wafer manufacturing capacity has also been announced. The question remains whether these announcements will translate into operational factories.

However, these potential production capacities are far from meeting the increasing demand of solar PV installation in Europe that reached 65 GW16 in 2024 and projected to reach between 81 GW and 112 GW in 2028. Similarly, on a larger energy scale, according to Enerdata’s Enerfuture scenarios17 & 18. According to Enerfuture, by 2030 the share of renewables in the European primary energy could reach 18%, 23% or 28% according to the scenario. This implicated an installed solar energy capacity of 2.6 thousands GW, 3.5 thousands GW or 5 thousands GW respectively. These capacities are far from the 2024 installed capacity of 338 GW 15.

In Q3 2024, the United States reached a record-breaking 9.3 GW of new solar module manufacturing capacity. Five new or expanded factories in Alabama, Florida, Ohio, and Texas brought the total U.S. solar module manufacturing capacity to nearly 40 GW19. In the same quarter, First Solar and Runergy opened a 3.5 GW and 5 GW PV modules facility, respectively, both located in Alabama. The NREL estimates the available nameplate production capacity in the USA at 50 GW as of 2024209.

U.S. Solar Market Insight Q4 estimates that the USA currently has 24.1 GW of PV module production capacity under construction, and another 13.1 GW announced. Within 2024, the country brought online 24 GW of new module production capacity, a momentum spurred by the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA)21.

In September, Congress ended a Biden-era program providing a $7,500 tax credit for purchasing an electric vehicle.
charge ""comes on top of an estimated $4 billion to $5 billion that GM projects it will pay in tariff-related costs this year.""
General Motors followed the trend of government rather than consumer sentiment, and now it's scrambling to adapt when the government changes hands.","Sales of electric vehicles (E.V.s) surged in August and September as buyers took advantage of a federal tax credit before it expired. Now, automakers expect to sell fewer E.V.s—and lose money on them—for the rest of the year.

It raises the question, Is the American E.V. market just a creation of government policy?

""General Motors said it is reducing its electric-vehicle manufacturing capacity and booking a $1.6 billion charge on its EV business as demand sinks,"" reports The Wall Street Journal's Sharon Terlep. ""In a regulatory filing, the company said that EV sales are expected to fall with the end of government-funded subsidies and regulatory mandates that fueled EV growth.""

This was a monumental shift within just a few years: In 2021, General Motors CEO Mary Barra announced the auto giant would phase out all gas-burning vehicles by 2035.

Under the Biden administration, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) adopted emissions rules that would effectively require more than half of all new vehicles produced by 2032 to be electric. The agency rescinded those rules in March, after President Donald Trump reentered office.

In September, Congress ended a Biden-era program providing a $7,500 tax credit for purchasing an electric vehicle. Motorists apparently flocked to dealerships ahead of the program's sunset date, but analysts expected demand to plummet once the credit went away. ""The demise of the tax credit will probably bring the party to an end,"" Neal E. Boudette wrote last month in The New York Times. ""Sales of electric models are expected to plummet in the last three months of the year and then remain sluggish for some time.""

To be clear, slow electric vehicle sales are not General Motors' only problem, or even the biggest drag on its profits: The tariffs Trump has imposed by fiat are hurting the automaker's bottom line, as well. As Terlep noted, the $1.6 billion E.V. charge ""comes on top of an estimated $4 billion to $5 billion that GM projects it will pay in tariff-related costs this year."" Just in the second quarter of this year, Ford Motor Co. paid $800 million in tariffs and posted its first quarterly financial loss since 2023.

Still, General Motors' announcement supports the concern that without infusions of taxpayer money, E.V.s are not entirely viable on their own. It's no wonder, since they have not been driven by consumer preference.

From the start, the Biden-era rules prioritized all-electric vehicles over hybrids, which the EPA estimated would account for only 16 percent of all new vehicles sold by 2032. (For comparison, it estimated there would still be nearly twice that many cars with internal combustion engines.) But consumers have made it clear that if they get rid of their gas-burning cars, they're more comfortable with a hybrid than an electric.

""While EV sales are growing, their pace is falling well short of the industry's ambitious timetable for transitioning away from combustion engines,"" Tom Krisher of the Associated Press reported in 2023. ""Instead, buyers are increasingly embracing a quarter-century-old technology whose popularity has been surging: The gas-electric hybrid, which alternates from gas to battery power to maximize efficiency.""

In its 2024 annual consumer survey, the American Automobile Association (AAA) found similar results: While only 18 percent of respondents said they were likely to buy an electric, 31 percent were open to a hybrid.

""Access to a hybrid vehicle lessens the anxiety for consumers because it allows people to enjoy the benefits of electrification without feeling like they are disrupting their current lifestyle or travel plans (longer distance driving, less charging options, etc.),"" AAA noted of its findings.

Even though federal incentives have nudged them in other directions, automakers have tried to follow consumer sentiment. In August 2024, Ford announced it was shifting focus from electrics to hybrids. The automaker had separated its production lines into traditional and electric divisions just two years earlier, and since then, ""Ford's electric vehicle division has lost $12 billion, including $2.2 billion in the first half of this year,"" the Times reported in August.

In January 2024, Toyota chairman Akio Toyoda predicted all-electric vehicles would only ever make up about 30 percent of the total automotive market. Instead, Toyoda advocated a ""multi-pathway approach"" to cutting carbon emissions on the road, and said ""customers, not regulations or politics,"" should drive innovation.

Toyoda is right. General Motors followed the trend of government rather than consumer sentiment, and now it's scrambling to adapt when the government changes hands.",https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2025/10/general-motors-gm-building-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-15 12:12:26.238408

In a regulatory filing, GM indicated that the adoption rate of EVs is anticipated to decline following the cessation of certain consumer tax incentives and the relaxation of emissions regulations.

The EV tax credit, which provided up to $7,500 for new vehicles and $4,000 for used ones, expired last month.

The company outlined that the charge will encompass non-cash impairment and other costs totalling $1.2bn, attributed to adjustments in EV capacity.

Additionally, GM expects to incur $400m in expenses primarily associated with contract cancellations and commercial settlements linked to its EV investments.

It has cautioned that further financial impacts may arise as it continues to reassess its EV capacity and manufacturing footprint, including investments in battery component production.

The automaker stated that it is “reasonably possible” it will recognise additional material cash and non-cash charges that could negatively influence its operational results and cash flows.

Despite these adjustments, GM clarified that the realignment of its EV capacity will not affect its current retail offerings, including the Chevrolet, GMC, and Cadillac EV models that are already in production.

Last month, GM decided to scale back production at one of its key EV manufacturing facilities.

A report from Reuters indicated that the company will temporarily halt production of two electric Cadillac SUV models at its Spring Hill, Tennessee plant in December, responding to the reduced federal support for EVs under the current administration.

The energy sector across Europe has seen significant increases in renewable energy production that can be attributed to a variety of factors. Leading the charge is the exceedingly hot weather in Europe, which has resulted in an increase in renewable energy generation.

Industry insiders have noted the increased generation from the renewable energy sector in Europe

For far too long, the world has relied on the conventional energy sector to meet energy demands. That reliance has had a disastrous impact on the global environment, as climate disasters become an all too real result of the world’s proclivity for non-renewable energy sources.

As the climate problems have become too significant to ignore, the world’s leaders have laid out their nations’ plans to reduce reliance on the non-renewable energy sector in favor of the renewable power that solar and wind present. What we must remember is that this transition will not take place overnight, but we can take solace in the fact that most nations across the world have made significant steps towards realizing a future where renewable energy is the dominant force in the sector.

Solar power leads the charge, with wind power set to see significant increases by the year 2030

The general acceptance and embrace of the renewable energy sector seen in Europe has been a welcome change from the status quo. A report from the University of Surrey noted that solar energy is the cheapest source of power on the continent.

That report stated that in June of this year, solar power became the EU’s largest source of electricity, outpacing the conventional oil and gas sectors substantially. The report also noted that wind power started the summer strong, with the highest ever generation for the months of May and June.

During this year alone, wind farms generated 16.6% (33.7 TWh) and 15.8% (32.4 TWh) of EU electricity during May and June, respectively. This astonishing turnaround in the European energy sector aligns with the global calls for a reduction in the coal and gas sectors.

Wind power is set to continue to increase and could potentially outpace its solar-powered cousin in the renewable energy sector. When that does happen, wind power will become the dominant force in the energy sector. Coal and gas have seen a significant reduction in production due to a myriad of mitigating factors, including the war in Ukraine and the rise in AI-driven data centers in the United States.

The global proclivity for wind power has seen several countries investing vast amounts of money in new wind farms, further accelerating the transition to the renewable energy sector globally. A prerequisite for the global calls for decarbonization is to invest heavily in both the wind and solar power sectors.

The political leaders in the United States have been urging the global energy sector to embrace the potential that the renewable energy sector presents.

“I strongly agree with Vice President Gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence, but must fast-track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power, wind power and advanced biofuels…” – Former US President Barack Obama

(AP) — Federal officials rejected a company's bid to acquire 167 million tons of coal on public lands in Montana for less than a penny per ton, in what would have been the biggest U.S. government coal sale in more than a decade.

The failed sale underscores a continued low appetite for coal among utilities that are turning to cheaper natural gas and renewables such as wind and solar to generate electricity. Emissions from burning coal are a leading driver of climate change, which scientists say is raising sea levels and making weather more extreme.

President Donald Trump has made reviving the coal industry a centerpiece of his agenda to increase U.S. energy production. But economists say Trump's attempts to boost coal are unlikely to reverse its yearslong decline.

The Department of Interior said in a Tuesday statement that last week's $186,000 bid from the Navajo Transitional Energy Co. (NTEC) did not meet the requirements of the Mineral Leasing Act.

Agency representatives did not provide further details, and it's unclear if they will attempt to hold the sale again.

The leasing act requires bids to be at or above fair market value. At the last successful government lease sale in the region, a subsidiary of Peabody Energy paid $793 million, or $1.10 per ton, for 721 million tons of coal in Wyoming.

President Joe Biden's administration sought to end coal sales in the Powder River Basin of Montana and Wyoming, citing climate change.

A second proposed lease sale under Trump — 440 million tons of coal near an NTEC mine in central Wyoming — was postponed last week following the low bid received in the Montana sale. Interior Department officials have not said when the Wyoming sale will be rescheduled.

NTEC is owned by the Navajo Nation of Arizona, New Mexico and Utah.

In documents submitted in the run-up to the Montana sale, NTEC indicated the coal had little value because of declining demand for the fuel. The Associated Press emailed a company representative regarding the rejected bid.

Most power plants using fuel from NTEC's Spring Creek mine in Montana and Antelope mine in Wyoming are scheduled to stop burning coal in the next decade, according to an analysis by The Associated Press.

Spring Creek also ships coal overseas to customers in Asia. Increasing those shipments could help it offset lessening domestic demand, but a shortage of port capacity has hobbled prior industry aspirations to boost coal exports.",https://img.ien.com/mindful/im/workspaces/default/uploads/2025/10/ap25287538260305.Gu15JjHRt2.jpg?auto=format%2Ccompress&crop=focalpoint&fit=max&fp-x=0.54&fp-y=0.51&q=70&w=1200,N,,2025-10-15 16:10:56.675119

A Living Lab for Carbon Efficiency

In Elkhart, Indiana, Amazon has transformed a delivery station into a testing ground for the next generation of sustainable logistics. Known internally as DII5, the site combines operations with an experimental framework—housing more than 40 market-ready technologies aimed at reducing emissions, energy use, and material intensity.

From the moment you approach the facility, the difference is visible. The building’s exposed timber interiors, vast glass windows, and 170 electric vehicle charging stations set a new tone for how e-commerce infrastructure can function in a low-carbon future.

“DII5 continues years of experimentation across Amazon’s real estate portfolio,” said Daniel Mallory, Amazon’s Vice President of Global Realty. “It brings together lessons learned from how we operate and how we build, and it will guide us as we move closer to our climate goals.”

Building Design as Climate Strategy

Globally, buildings and construction contribute nearly 40% of greenhouse gas emissions, according to the Carbon Leadership Forum. Amazon’s Climate Pledge—committing the company to reach net-zero carbon by 2040—places building innovation among its highest operational priorities.

The Elkhart station serves as a microcosm of that ambition. Its integrated systems measure performance across heating, lighting, materials, and energy use in real time. The company’s intent is not simply to operate one sustainable site, but to determine which design and operational models can be scaled across its logistics and fulfillment network worldwide.

Materials and Systems Under Test

Amazon’s design approach at DII5 moves beyond standard retrofits. Heat pumps replace fossil fuel–based systems, avoiding on-site combustion. Air curtains limit the loss of conditioned air at entryways, improving thermal comfort and reducing electricity demand.

Clerestory windows and large glazed openings allow daylight to replace much of the artificial lighting load. All installed lighting is LED-based, calibrated for efficiency and brightness uniformity across work zones.

Construction materials were chosen for their lower embodied carbon content. Interior walls use wooden studs in place of steel, paired with bio-based wood fiber insulation rather than fiberglass. An ultra-light, low-carbon drywall alternative was used throughout, while acoustic ceilings and flooring rely on renewable finishes.

Even Amazon’s signature “door desks” were reimagined—replaced with salvaged-wood versions supplied by Cambium, a company that upcycles reclaimed timber for commercial interiors.

Capturing Data for Global Application

Each system installed at DII5 is part of a feedback loop. Amazon’s facilities team will monitor emissions, energy, and comfort metrics to determine which technologies offer the best balance between cost and performance. Early findings are expected to influence upcoming builds and retrofits in Amazon’s growing logistics network.

“Buildings are not only operational assets—they’re climate assets,” said a senior facilities engineer involved in the project. “This site helps us quantify that value.”

Some of the early concepts tested at Elkhart are already being integrated into other Amazon facilities, particularly energy-efficient HVAC configurations and daylight-optimised design principles.

Beyond Elkhart: The Global Relevance

Amazon’s experiment arrives amid growing scrutiny of corporate building portfolios. The International Energy Agency has warned that without rapid decarbonization in the construction and real estate sectors, global net-zero targets remain out of reach.

By converting an operational delivery site into a full-scale testing environment, Amazon joins a growing list of multinationals—from Microsoft to IKEA—reassessing their real estate footprints as climate laboratories.

The lessons from DII5 could extend beyond logistics. If proven cost-effective, Amazon’s model of live testing and scalable adoption may serve as a prototype for how large corporates integrate ESG innovation into physical infrastructure.

For Amazon, the stakes extend far beyond one building in Indiana. The Elkhart project is designed to feed evidence-based decisions across thousands of facilities globally. As the company moves toward its 2040 net-zero commitment, what it learns here will help shape not only its own carbon trajectory but the emerging standards for sustainable industrial architecture worldwide.",https://esgnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Amazon-Tests-Next-Gen-Decarbonization-Strategies-at-New-Indiana-Facility.jpg,N,,2025-10-15 13:10:50.247628

In its Endangerment Finding One Pager, EPA states that “The 2009 Endangerment Finding was the first step in the Obama-Biden Administration’s (and later the Biden-Harris Administration’s) overreaching climate agenda.
Subsequent court decisions, even ones that invalidated specific EPA climate rules (such as the 2015 Clean Power Plan), have not reversed or undermined the ruling in Mass v. EPA.
Every one of EPA’s greenhouse gas regulations has been challenged in court, with exhaustive discussion of EPA’s legal underpinnings, technical analysis, cost-benefit analysis, and the scientific basis of the Finding.
There are lots of summaries available from different perspectives, and fact-checking posts such as EPA attacks climate science.","EPA is calling it the “largest deregulatory action in U.S. history.” The New York Times called it “President Trump’s most consequential step yet to derail federal climate efforts,” which “appears to represent a shift toward outright denial of the scientific consensus.” Others say that the proposal “rejects mainstream science and misunderstands the law” and “relies on misinterpretations of the law and recent cases, fringe science, and tortured cost analysis.” And that EPA is choosing “polluters over people.”

Whatever side of the science and policy issues you find yourself on, this proposal is big news. And rightfully so. The Endangerment Finding, which EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson issued in 2009 under Section 202(a) of the Clean Air Act, is the legal underpinning for the rules EPA has issued in the past 15 years that limit emissions of greenhouse gases from motor vehicles and has provided vital support for rules limiting greenhouse gas emissions from power plants, oil and gas operations, and landfills. Motor vehicles and power plants make up about half of US emissions; oil and gas operations are the largest single industrial source; and landfills are significant emitters of methane, a greenhouse gas more potent than CO2. If the proposal is finalized and withstands legal challenge, it could well preclude EPA from regulating greenhouse gases in the future (indeed, this is the objective of the rulemaking), meaning that the only way greenhouse gases could be controlled at the federal level in the United States would be if Congress passed a law either doing so itself or giving EPA specific new authority to do so.

In its Endangerment Finding One Pager, EPA states that “The 2009 Endangerment Finding was the first step in the Obama-Biden Administration’s (and later the Biden-Harris Administration’s) overreaching climate agenda. That agenda has imposed trillions of dollars of costs on Americans. For a generation, defenders of this agenda have avoided scrutiny of how it all began.” As someone who worked in EPA’s Office of Air and Radiation when the Endangerment Finding was issued and throughout the rest of the Obama Administration and then again during the Biden Administration, it is difficult to read statements like these without providing a response.

First Claim: Has EPA’s “climate agenda” been overreaching? Climate scientists around the world are increasingly in agreement that 1) anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions are the major cause of increased GHGs in the atmosphere; 2) that those increased GHGs are causing the earth’s surface to warm; 3) that the warming is affecting not just the “climate” (i.e., long term, geographically broad conditions of temperature, precipitation, wind speed, etc.) but also the “weather” (e.g., do I need an umbrella today? Are we having a hurricane or windstorm or heat wave today?). The Clean Air Act charged EPA with addressing “any air pollutant” that the Administrator determines “may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare,” and to set standards regulating the emission of that air pollutant from mobile sources. CAA Section 202(a)(1). The US Supreme Court decided in 2007 in Massachusetts v. EPA that greenhouse gases do fit within the term “air pollutant,” and EPA should therefore respond—in whatever way it determined was correct—to a petition asking the agency to regulate GHGs from motor vehicles under Section 202(a)(1). Subsequent court decisions, even ones that invalidated specific EPA climate rules (such as the 2015 Clean Power Plan), have not reversed or undermined the ruling in Mass v. EPA.

Second Claim: Has EPA’s regulation of GHGs imposed trillions of dollars of costs on Americans? EPA does not provide support for this statement, and I am hard-pressed to understand how it could be true. The Regulatory Impact Assessment for the GHG rules for powerplants finalized in 2024 calculated around $20B in costs for the power plant rule. For the 2024 motor vehicle rules, the cost was projected to be $40B. Cost-benefit analysis is both art and science, and the many choices agencies make about what costs to count and how to count them can dramatically change the outcome. What is clear in this rulemaking action, however, and in the “trillions of dollars of costs” statement, is that the EPA is choosing not to consider any of the benefits that have already been experienced by the American people or that will be in the future from less pollution and mitigation of climate change impacts. A CBS review of the Draft Regulatory Impact Assessment found that the Administration’s own analysis shows that if the current GHG standards were repealed as proposed, gasoline prices would increase, and nearly a half million jobs would be lost by 2035. The regulatory impact analysis shows, under its two most likely and realistic scenarios, that repealing the vehicle GHG standards would result in a cost of $260 billion dollars between 2027 and 2055 in one case and $350 billion dollars in net costs in the other.

Third Claim: Have “defenders of this agenda…avoided scrutiny of how it all began”? Not hardly. Every one of EPA’s greenhouse gas regulations has been challenged in court, with exhaustive discussion of EPA’s legal underpinnings, technical analysis, cost-benefit analysis, and the scientific basis of the Finding. EPA has kept pace with science over the years; the more recent rules have updated the facts on the ground and the predictions of future climate impacts. Indeed, the scientific record has grown ever more robust, with each year of record temperatures, runaway wildfires that affect air quality across massive areas of the US, and storms that take lives and destroy property. The Endangerment Finding has been examined in a sea of lawsuits and withstood each challenge. (See Inside Trump’s Renewed Effort to Undo a Major Climate Rule, Zraick and Friedman, NYT January 18, 2025).

We’ll see what happens this time. The proposal relies on several legal arguments for overturning the 2009 Finding, the passage of time, court decisions such as West Virginia v. EPA (major questions), and a draft report from the Department of Energy to support its conclusions that EPA does not have the authority to regulate greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act, did it wrong in 2009, and alternatively, that circumstances have changed such that a finding (and the subsequent regulation of emissions from mobile sources) is no longer warranted. There are lots of summaries available from different perspectives, and fact-checking posts such as EPA attacks climate science. Here are the facts. – E&E News by POLITICO, and I encourage you to read them. You may also want to read the report issued by the National Academies of Science on September 17, which focuses on climate science since 2009 and finds that “the evidence for current and future harm to human health and welfare created by human-caused greenhouse gases is beyond scientific dispute.”

Every day that goes by with more greenhouse gases emitted and the delay of available opportunities to shift to cleaner sources of energy makes it that much harder for society to manage what the future will look like.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.15968_154.jpg,N,,2025-10-15 12:12:12.950568

In July, the Netherlands-based automaker reported half-year results that included losses of 2.3 billion euros (nearly $2.7 billion).
During the period, U.S. shipments were down by nearly a quarter as the carmaker reduced the importation vehicles produced abroad.

The world's fourth-largest carmaker said Tuesday the investment will support the introduction of five new vehicles, including a Dodge Durango to be built in Detroit and a midsize truck to be assembled in Toledo, Ohio. The new jobs will be spread across plants in Illinois, Ohio, Michigan and Indiana.

Stellantis, which was created 4½ years ago from the merger of Fiat Chrysler and PSA Peugeot, is hoping to counteract some of the expected 1.5 billion-euro ($1.7 billion) cost of tariffs this year on cars produced in Canada and Mexico by boosting North American profitability with new model launches like the discontinued Jeep Cherokee.

The new product launches will be in addition to 19 ""refreshed"" products across all U.S. assembly plants and updated powertrains planned through 2029, the company said.

""This investment in the U.S. — the single largest in the company's history — will drive our growth, strengthen our manufacturing footprint and bring more American jobs to the states we call home,"" CEO Antonio Filosa said in a statement.

Stellantis' operations in the U.S. include 34 manufacturing plants, parts distribution centers and research and development sites across 14 states.

Of the 16 million cars Stellantis produces for sale in the U.S. market, 8 million are made in domestic plants, and another 4 million in Canada and Mexico — all with a large number of U.S. components. Another 4 million are imported from Europe and Asia, with virtually no U.S. components.

In pursuit of a U.S. turnaround, Filosa is also relaunching in the second half of 2025 models that previous management nixed two years ago: a new Jeep Cherokee, which will be produced in Mexico and the popular ICE Dodge Charger.

Earlier this year, Stellantis also relaunched the Ram Hemi V8 because of dealer and customer demand.

In July, the Netherlands-based automaker reported half-year results that included losses of 2.3 billion euros (nearly $2.7 billion). During the period, U.S. shipments were down by nearly a quarter as the carmaker reduced the importation vehicles produced abroad.

RU4M brings together four of the nation’s top research institutions: Michigan State University, Michigan Technological University, the University of Michigan, and Wayne State University.
For the RU4M universities, sustainability is a top priority, recognized as such by presidents, researchers, staff, and students alike.
This year, RU4M launched the Livable Futures Initiative, a bold effort to catalyze cross-disciplinary research that helps Michigan communities thrive.
For example, Michigan State University is piloting bioreactors to reduce agricultural runoff.","Michigan is a state defined by its natural abundance and resilience. Our lakes, rivers and forests are woven into our identity, our economy and our future. Yet, this abundance also comes with responsibility. Communities across Michigan are facing mounting challenges: flooding in Detroit neighborhoods, failing dams in Midland, harmful algal blooms in Lake Erie, and pressures on our energy and transportation systems. Climate change, population shifts and economic disruption are no longer distant possibilities; they are realities shaping our present. At Research Universities for Michigan (RU4M), we believe the solutions to these challenges — and the opportunities they present — begin with collaboration.

RU4M brings together four of the nation’s top research institutions: Michigan State University, Michigan Technological University, the University of Michigan, and Wayne State University. Together, we represent one of the most research-intensive coalitions in the country, uniquely positioned to advance sustainability, innovation, and prosperity across our state and the Great Lakes region. For the RU4M universities, sustainability is a top priority, recognized as such by presidents, researchers, staff, and students alike. While acknowledging the significant challenges posed by current environmental and resource issues, the university community understands that the myriad technologies and talents required to build a sustainable future also represent a considerable economic opportunity for today’s innovators.

This year, RU4M launched the Livable Futures Initiative, a bold effort to catalyze cross-disciplinary research that helps Michigan communities thrive. This initiative is about more than solving problems. It’s about imagining and building futures where Michigan leads the world in sustainable solutions, leveraging our unique assets: abundant freshwater, engineering and manufacturing expertise, and a deep culture of innovation.

Investing in Seed Grants for Change

As part of this initiative, RU4M recently announced the Livable Futures – Water Collaboration Grants, a $400,000 seed funding program to support innovative, interdisciplinary research across our universities. These projects will tackle some of the most urgent questions facing our state:

How do we protect our lakes while meeting increased demand for potable water and wastewater management in growing cities and agricultural regions?

What strategies will help us manage coastlines and low-lying communities vulnerable to flooding?

How can we build a resilient “blue economy” that sustains shipping, energy, and fisheries while protecting ecosystems?

By design, these grants require collaboration across at least three RU4M universities, and preference is given to projects involving all four. This ensures we are not working in silos but instead leveraging the full breadth of expertise across institutions, whether in engineering, natural sciences, public health, or policy. Equally important, we are prioritizing projects that engage communities directly. Sustainability cannot be solved in labs alone. By incorporating stakeholder input from local governments, businesses, and residents, we can ensure the research is not just innovative but also practical, inclusive and responsive to Michigan’s real-world needs.

The Power of Collaboration

The scale of today’s challenges requires more than technical fixes. It demands new models of collaboration. Michigan’s four research universities collectively generate more than $1 billion in sustainability research every five years. By connecting these efforts, aligning agendas, and creating shared pathways for impact, RU4M multiplies the effect of every dollar invested. For example, Michigan State University is piloting bioreactors to reduce agricultural runoff. Michigan Technological University is developing new tools for resource management in tandem with engineering solutions. The University of Michigan is leading on water infrastructure resilience, while Wayne State researchers are working closely with Detroit communities on flooding solutions. Together, these efforts create a research ecosystem that protects the environment while fueling economic growth and job creation.

The idea that sustainability and economic prosperity need not be considered trade-offs and can, in fact, reinforce one another is what Matt Elliott, Blue Lakes Ideas Founder and former president of Bank of America Michigan, calls “The Power of &.” We agree and see examples in our work. Clean water protects public health, attracts families and businesses, and drives industries from recreation to shipping. Climate-smart infrastructure strengthens communities while reducing costly disasters. Innovation in clean energy and mobility not only generates environmental benefits but also drives the industries of the future.

Michigan’s Global Responsibility

Michigan sits at the center of one of the world’s greatest freshwater resources. Some have called us the “freshwater capital of the world.” But that abundance comes with responsibility. If managed wisely, Michigan can set the global standard for water innovation: how to protect, manage and leverage freshwater resources for both economic and environmental resilience.

This is not just about Michigan. Climate change and demographic shifts are already prompting families and businesses from across the country to look to the Great Lakes region as a place of stability and opportunity. With moderate weather, vast water resources, and strong infrastructure, Michigan could see significant population and investment growth in the coming decades. The question is whether we are ready. The Livable Futures Initiative is about ensuring that we are — not just reacting to challenges but leading with foresight.

Preparing the Next Generation

Another central goal of RU4M’s work is preparing students—the future leaders, scientists, and entrepreneurs who will carry this mission forward. Through incubators, accelerators, and entrepreneurial programs, RU4M universities are not only training students in cutting-edge research but also encouraging them to launch ventures that tackle sustainability challenges head-on. Already, one in five RU4M alumni become entrepreneurs, with many building startups in clean technology, advanced materials, and water innovation.

Equally, we are ensuring that university curricula reflect the skills industry needs. By listening to employers and aligning training with emerging fields, we are creating a talent pipeline ready to meet Michigan’s sustainability and economic development goals.

A Call to Action

The Sustainable Urban Design Summit provides an ideal backdrop for these conversations. This gathering of researchers, practitioners, policymakers, and community leaders underscores a central truth: no single sector can build livable futures alone. We need collaboration across institutions, across industries, and across communities.

Michigan has the assets, the talent, and the drive to lead the global conversation on sustainability. But leadership requires action. It requires investing in research and innovation today to secure the future we want for our children and grandchildren.

The Livable Futures Initiative is RU4M’s commitment to that future. It is an investment not only in Michigan’s resilience, but also in its prosperity and its role as a global leader. Together with universities, policymakers, businesses, and communities working hand in hand, we can ensure that Michigan’s future is not only livable but thriving.",https://detroitisit.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SUDS-2025-Sponsors-2.png,N,,2025-10-15 13:09:52.365829

Her passion for preserving forests — from the mountains to the coast — is unmistakable.

“Trees are amazing,” Cohen says with a smile. “Just think about the products we get from forests: building supplies, food, textiles. We can manipulate them to get what we need but still maintain their ecological integrity.”

With master’s and PhD degrees in forestry, Cohen has spent most of her career exploring how to conserve and sustainably manage our nation’s forests. Before joining the UNC Institute for the Environment in 2018, she worked with the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) at Camp Lejeune, studying the resilience of coastal, estuarine, and forest ecosystems surrounding the military base.

“The DoD manages almost 30 million acres of natural resources, which often surprises people,” Cohen says. “The military uses those land and water resources for training, and that is very compatible with managing habitat and ecosystem services.”

Her deep-rooted love for forests hasn’t changed — but her toolkit has. Today, Cohen is just as enthusiastic about drones as she is about trees.

“Drones are a game-changer,” she says. “They allow us to collect data faster, safer, and often more accurately than traditional methods.”

When Cohen arrived at Carolina, she quickly realized that while many researchers were using drones, there was no centralized hub for training, equipment, or collaboration. So in 2021, she helped launch the Carolina Drone Lab (CARDNL) to harness aerial technology for tackling environmental challenges.

Now, CARDNL supports researchers across UNC-Chapel Hill and beyond, offering technical expertise and data solutions that elevate environmental research.

Cohen will be one of 26 participants at this year’s Research and Discovery Fair, part of University Research Week, on Wednesday, October 22 from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. at the FPG Student Union. The event showcases active research spaces across campus — all offering opportunities for students to get involved.

UNC Research Stories sat down with Cohen to learn more about her work and why hands-on research experiences are so important for students.

What’s the main goal of your research?

Our mission is to provide tools and actionable information to the people managing and stewarding our natural resources. The pitch is simple: Come and do important field work and collect data, fly drones, and help solve problems.

What projects are you working on now?

We have many projects, but I have a few favorites. One is studying how the moisture content in the understory plants longleaf pine forests changes over time. This is a major factor for determining if and how a prescribed fire is set and then how it behaves. You’d be surprised by how that moisture changes hourly. This project uses remote sensing — when aerial sensors obtain data — but is really based on traditional on-the-ground field work. Fire managers and modelers want that information.

The other project is working in the marshes and sea grass beds of Currituck Sound to understand their resilience and track changes over time from restoration efforts. These ecosystems have incredible social and economic benefits. We are using drones, machine learning, and remote sensing to help our partners manage those marshes. This work has applications across North Carolina and beyond.

What are the biggest challenges in your research?

Funding is always the biggest challenge, but once we acquire that, it’s logistics and planning. Sometimes, we work in challenging conditions and do intensive fieldwork like wading through marsh muck or working in severe heat. And the drones have lots of rules and regulations, which can be difficult to navigate. For example, you have to be able to see the drone at all times, which is super hard in a forest. And batteries definitely don’t last long enough.

What’s the most surprising discovery your team has made recently?

We’re seeing some early data showing a clear difference in how certain sections of bunch grasses — plants that benefit from fire, which removes dead vegetation and stimulates new growth — hold moisture. Specifically, the leaves near the ground and the flowering parts higher up dry out at different rates and have noticeably different moisture levels. It might sound like a small detail, but it can have a big impact when it comes to how fire behaves.

If your research could solve one big problem, what would it be?

A big interest of mine is getting rid of invasive species in forest habitats. They destroy biodiversity and ecosystem function and cost a shocking amount of money to control.

What’s the coolest tool you use in the lab?

It is hard to deny that our big drones are pretty cool. Folks are familiar with the smaller ones that tend to be more widely owned, but our biggest, heavy lift drone makes an impression with its size and the noise it makes when flying. It sounds like a helicopter.

Can undergraduate students get involved in your lab?

Some projects have funding built in to support student involvement, and we try to create those opportunities. Unfortunately, our field schedule for data collection often doesn’t jive with students’ class and semester schedules. But there is so much work to do in addition to field work and data collection like literature reviews, data entry, processing imagery, and analyzing data. It isn’t very glamorous, but these are critical parts of research.

What do students gain from working with you?

Students are immediately exposed to teams collaborating on research projects and independent work addressing parts of a project. We talk about natural resource challenges and management a lot, so there is broad exposure to that world, from attending meetings with collaborators to organizing projects to translating data. And while we might not be able to take a student to the field, we always make sure there is plenty of drone flying, map making, and a chance to take their FAA Part 107 test to become a certified drone pilot.

Share a specific anecdote of how a former student on your team took what they learned and applied it in the real world.

The Hazardous Waste Subcommittee of the Association of State and Territorial Solid Waste Management Officials (“ASTSWMO”) sent a September 16th letter providing comments to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) for submission to the upcoming Hazardous Waste Electronic Manifest System (“e-Manifest”) Advisory Board meeting.

The Advisory Board meeting was held from September 23 – 25.

EPA had announced the e-Manifest Advisory Board meeting and also included in the Federal Register notice:

Charge Questions posed to the e-Manifest Advisory Board.

Background White Paper providing information on the issues to be discussed by the Board.

ASTSWMO describes itself as an organization representing the 50 States, 5 Territories and the District of Columbia whose mission is to enhance and promote effective State and Territorial programs and to affect relevant national policies for waste and materials management, environmentally sustainable practices, and environmental restoration.

The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) cradle-to-grave Hazardous Waste Tracking System attempts to ensure that hazardous waste is properly generated, transported, and treated or disposed. The cradle-to-grave system has always been a key component of RCRA.

Federal legislation enacted in 2012 tasked EPA with the development of a national electronic manifest system. Further, it authorized the federal agency to assess the cost of developing and operating an e-Manifest system from user fees. Such fees would be charged to those who use the hazardous waste manifest to track off-shipments of their waste.

The e-Manifest system is a national database that similarly tracks hazardous waste shipments. It was launched by EPA in 2009. The goal of the e-Manifest system is to improve access to higher quality and timely data while also saving time and resources for industry, state, and territorial programs.

ASTSWMO notes in its September 16th comments that the theme of the Advisory Board meeting is referenced as:

Accelerating the Future: Phasing out Paper Manifests to Unlock the Full Potential of e-Manifest.

ASTSWMO states that it has reversed its position regarding retention of use of paper manifests. It states that the organization:

…now supports the use of fully electronic manifests.

One stated reason for this position is the concern that because data quality issues persist, it believes that maintaining two separate systems is contributing is contributing to such problems and that a transition to fully electronic manifesting, with all entities providing an electronic signature is preferrable.

Additional points raised in the ASTSWMO comments include:

Coordinating with the U.S. Department of Transportation is necessary, as it appears to be one of the most significant impediments to achieving a fully electronic e-Manifest system (noting DOT requires a physical paper copy of the manifest to be in the transport vehicle).

If EPA chooses to sunset paper manifests and transition to a fully electronic system:

Facilities that are normally very small quantity generators but have an episodic event should be required to register with the e-Manifest system in order to retain records.

EPA should consider the impact of the paper sunset requirement on the use of voluntary manifests as contemplated in the e-Manifest Frequently Asked Questions.

Supports EPA requiring e-Manifest registration for all entities involved in the waste handling process, including the generator, transporter, and the designated facility.

Supports removing the existing paper-based manifest record-retention requirements (entities currently required to maintain a paper manifest should be obligated to establish and maintain electronic access to their manifest via the e-Manifest system).

Supports a delayed enforcement and compliance approach to sunset paper manifests.

Appreciates EPA’s acknowledgement of state regulators and providing user support and management of the user registration process.

Supports EPA hosting an e-Manifest User Conference as outlined in the Background White Paper.

Added work on e-Manifest information has stretched limited state program resources and may not be sustainable without revisiting funding levels or expectations of workload.

agrees with EPA’s proposal related to the replacement manifest as outlined in the Background White Paper in the event that the e-Manifest system becomes temporarily unavailable for electronic manifest tracking.

Supports the sunsetting of paper manifests to assist with the integration of e-Manifest and the Biennial Report.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.15833_1120.jpg,N,,2025-10-15 12:12:22.204232

Earlier this year, FAS sounded the alarm that federal reductions in force, funding pauses and freezes, program elimination, and other actions were stalling or setting back national preparedness for extreme heat – just as summer was kicking into gear. The areas we focused on included:

Leadership and governance infrastructure

Key personnel and their expertise

Data, forecasts, and information availability

Funding sources and programs for preparedness, risk mitigation and resilience

Progress towards heat policy goals

With summer 2025 in the rearview mirror, we’re taking a look back to see how federal actions impacted heat preparedness and response on the ground, what’s still changing, and what the road ahead looks like for heat resilience. Consider this your 2025 State of the Heat.

2025 State of the Heat

The State of Summer: How Hot Was It and How Did Communities Cope?

Summer didn’t feel as sweltering this year as it has the past couple of years. That’s objectively true – but only because the summers of 2023 and 2024 were true scorchers.

Summer 2025 was still the third-hottest on record. High temperature records were shattered across the country. Eight states broke their all-time heat records for June, and in July almost the entire country – including Alaska – saw above-average temperatures. Temperature extremes continued into September. Places like the San Francisco Bay Area experienced their hottest temperatures of the year even as the season turned to autumn. In addition, humidity was a particularly potent threat. One hundred twenty million people experienced near-record humidity this summer alongside temperature extremes. Humidity and heat are a deadly combination because sweating is less effective when humidity is high, raising the risk of overheating and experiencing heat-related illness. This heat led to spikes in heat-related illnesses and hospitalizations, longer droughts, road buckling and damage, and even a federal energy emergency in June 2025.

Since January 2025, and continuing over the course of the summer, FAS’s Climate and Health team has been in regular touch with local and state government officials involved in heat preparedness, response, and resilience. These officials generally shared that heat management activities continued successfully in most places throughout the summer despite disruptions to federal funding and programs. Officials emphasized three specific developments that helped enable that continuity:

Tools like the National Weather Service’s HeatRisk tool remained functional. HeatRisk is a critical tool for subnational governments to understand risks, inform and coordinate partners, and design thresholds for emergency response alerts and actions. Further, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)’s Heat and Health Tracker, which monitors heat-related visits in emergency departments across the country, was brought back online following reversals in CDC reductions in force.

Some key sources of federal funds, like American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) funding, remained available. Many local governments – particularly in places without large emergency management programs and Hazard Mitigation Assistance Program (HMGP) funds – have used ARPA funding to support heat response.

Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) funding was released after considerable advocacy from the external community and members of Congress. This funding is critical to support home energy assistance for cooling bills.

Yet this continuity is fragile:

The future of the National Integrated Heat Health Information System (NIHHIS) and the CDC’s Climate and Health program remains uncertain and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and CDC have faced notable staffing cuts and could face more cuts, jeopardizing the maintenance and existence of tools like HeatRisk and the Heat and Health Tracker.

Officials are also concerned about their ability to keep robust heat response programs going in a more austere funding landscape. For example, ARPA funding must be spent by December 31, 2026, and many officials are expecting a steep funding cliff that could lead to cuts to heat-related programs. We are already seeing evidence of this in Miami-Dade County, which eliminated its Chief Heat Officer position as a part of an effort to close a $400 million funding gap that emerged in part as ARPA funds were exhausted. Additional cuts to, and restrictions on, federal health preparedness programs and emergency management programs will also impact the staffing capacity of state and local governments. For example, one of the state officials FAS was working with on heat lost their job because of state budget shortfalls, and others have worried about their future job security.

Finally, while the LIHEAP program is currently intact, and has bipartisan support in Congress, it could be undermined by Executive Branch pocket rescissions and reductions in force.

The State of Federal Heat Governance: What Changed?

The federal heat landscape continues to be highly dynamic. While extreme heat is no longer a stated priority of the federal government, both this Administration and Congress have acknowledged heat’s risks. Against this backdrop, federal agencies are advancing a mixed bag of heat-related policies. For example:

The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) continues to pursue a heat rule. This rule, which was initiated under the Biden Administration and is a top priority for worker advocates, was included on the Trump Administration’s Unified Agenda as a regulation in development. However, given comments made at summer hearings on this rule, recent reporting has hypothesized that OSHA may model the rule after Nevada’s newer and weaker “performance-based” standards. This rule includes no “trigger temperatures” above which certain protections are required. An evaluation of the Nevada rule’s effectiveness will be limited by cuts to the staff at the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), and less funding for NIOSH’s research.

The National Institutes of Health (NIH) recommits to research on extreme heat and health. The NIH’s Climate Change and Health (CCH) Initiative was reintroduced as the Program on Health and Extreme Weather (HEW). The HEW Program’s strategic framework eliminates language directly referencing climate change and greenhouse gases and aligns with the Department of Health and Human Services’ broader MAHA strategy. As both houses of Congress rejected cuts to the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), there could be funding available through NIEHS for studies on the outcomes of heat exposure, long-term health risks, and preventative measures.

The Government Accountability Office (GAO) says the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) needs to evaluate its role in addressing extreme heat. A recent GAO report recommended that FEMA improve its benefit-cost analysis for heat, identify heat mitigation projects it might fund, and evaluate its role in heat response – all recommendations from FAS’s 2025 Heat Policy Agenda. FEMA agreed to act partially on the recommendations, citing changes made to HMGP to make extreme heat projects ineligible for standalone funding as a barrier to full action.

The Department of Energy acknowledges heatwaves as a particular risk. In July, the Department of Energy published a report entitled A Critical Review of the Science of Climate Change. This report has been widely discredited for cherry-picking and misrepresenting scientific studies. However, it is notable that even as the report minimizes the risks of greenhouse gas emissions, it emphasizes the importance of taking action on extreme heat, stating that “heatwaves have important effects on society that must be addressed” and that “inability to afford energy leaves low-income households exposed to weather extremes”. While there are partisan disagreements on how to secure that affordable energy, the report demonstrates that heat risk is an area of consensus between the parties that merits further pursuit.

The ongoing government shutdown could be used by the Trump Administration to continue their mass firing of federal workers. With the status of Appropriations negotiations stalled, the Office of Management and Budget has asked agencies to prepare contingency plans, and has threatened mass layoffs of furloughed employees. Given that most heat-related activities are not statutorily authorized, this could lead to further cuts to the federal heat workforce. On Friday October 10th, hundreds of workers were laid off across Health and Human Services, including at the CDC’s National Center for Health Statistics and the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response.

Congressional actions are also shaping what’s possible for nationwide heat preparedness. To start, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) cut funding necessary to mitigate extreme heat’s impacts as well as respond to the negative health consequences of heat. Impacts include:

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act cut funding necessary to mitigate extreme heat’s impacts

Rescinding heat resilience grant program fundingRescinding $138 million from the Green and Resilient Retrofit Program, which went to affordable multifamily housing units to install cool roofs, heat pumps, distributed energy resources, and improved insulation and windows. Rescinding $192 million from the Climate Pollution Reduction Grant Program, which went to building improvements that lower energy bills and increased resilience. Rescinding $516 million from the Environmental and Climate Justice Block Grants, which went to community heat risk mitigation activities and technical assistance. Rescinding $101 million from the Urban and Community Forestry Grant Program, which went to tree canopy projects that mitigate both urban and suburban heat islands. Rescinding $2.4 billion from the Neighborhood Access and Equity Program, which went to urban heat island reduction. Ending and restricting tax credits for cooling infrastructure investmentsEnding the Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit and Residential Clean Energy Credit on December 31, 2025, which helped homeowners make their homes more resilient to the impacts of extreme heat. Ending the New Energy Efficient Home Credit and Energy Efficient Commercial Buildings Deduction on June 30, 2026, which helped developers build more resilient homes. Removing eligibility for projects that use battery components sourced from certain foreign entities of concern (FEOCs) for the Investment Tax Credit (ITC), which helped grid operators make investments in battery storage technologies. Ending wind and solar as qualifying projects for the ITC and Production Tax Credits on July 4, 2026, which were going towards putting new energy on the grid. Restrictions and cuts to health funding to prepare for heat events and respond to heat illnessesSetting new limits on Section 1115 Demonstrations of Medicaid to require proof of cost-neutrality. States are using these waivers to cover things like air conditioners as a medical expense. Combined with the March 2025 rescission of the “health-related social needs” guidance and the phase out of funding for “Designated State Health Programs”, states may be limited in what preventative services they can offer. Changing health insurance policy (Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act) in ways that could lead to up to 16 million people to lose healthcare coverage. Less federal funding for health care will also have knock on effects. Low-resourced hospitals, such as those serving rural areas, may compromise their care or force some to close entirely.

Beyond OBBBA, Congressional appropriations proposals for Fiscal Year (FY) 2026 represent a mixed bag for federal heat policy. The House and the Senate proposals diverge in key ways, and will need to be rectified. Some of the things we are tracking include:

Congressional appropriations proposals for FY26 represent a mixed bag for federal heat policy

Funding levels for agencies that lead federal heat governanceNOAA: Both chambers fund the Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research, where NIHHIS is housed. Only the Senate’s appropriations proposal references NIHHIS and its critical role in heat governance and research CDC: The Senate provides full funding for the CDC’s Climate and Health program, while the House eliminates funding for the program. Both the House and Senate propose maintaining the National Environmental Public Health Tracking Network, which collects data on the health impacts of heat. Further, the Senate’s proposal calls on the CDC to improve tracking the costs of extreme heat as well as ensure public health departments are ready for disasters; meanwhile, the House’s proposal includes a provision that bars Health and Human Services from implementing any climate policies. Funding levels for partner agencies that drive heat-related data collection, research, and developmentNIEHS: Both chambers keep NIEHS at NIH and maintain FY25 funding levels. This rejects the proposed move of NIEHS to the Administration for a Healthy America and potential cuts that would co-occur with that move. NIOSH: Both chambers reject steep cuts to the agency, with the Senate even providing additional funding above FY25 levels. The Senate’s proposal also calls on the agency to improve its tracking of heat-related injuries and illnesses on the job. National Aeronautics and Space Administration: Both chambers retain FY25 funding levels for the agency. National Science Foundation: Both chambers reject the $5 billion dollar reduction in the agency’s funding, but the House still cuts $2 billion from FY25 funding levels of $9 billion. The House’s proposal also prohibits NSF funding from being used for the Global Change Research Program or the Clean Energy Technology Program, which could limit heat-related research. Funding levels for key heat preparedness grant programsLIHEAP remains funded at $4 billion in both the House and Senate proposals. The Senate’s proposal also includes a recommendation to review the LIHEAP formula, indicating an understanding of the growing need to address the costs of cooling. The Weatherization Assistance Program remains funded in the House’s proposal, though at a 45% reduction from FY24 funding levels, which will impact households. The Building Resilience in Communities Grant Program is reinstated in the House’s proposal, while adding restrictions that would make extreme heat projects ineligible. The Public Health Emergency Preparedness Cooperative Agreement is flat funded, maintaining funding for public health departments to do disaster response. The Hospital Preparedness Program is funded at $309 million in the Senate’s proposal and only $65 million in the House’s proposal. This is all while both proposals identify a need to address shortages in the emergency medical services workforces which could jeopardize health preparedness in the face of disasters. New heat-related policy and funding actionsThe House’s Agriculture Appropriations bill commits $400,000 to support bovine health, breeding, and genetics research related to heat stress mitigation. The Senate’s Agriculture Appropriations bill includes provisions to advance the science of dryland farming (tolerating heat and drought) and recognizes the importance of soil health to the resilience of crops to extreme heat. The House’s Energy-Water Appropriations bill calls on the Department of Energy to investigate the impacts of extreme weather events like heat waves, hurricanes, coastal and inland flooding, wildfires, and extreme droughts on U.S. energy systems. The House’s Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations bill calls on the Department of Defense to procure building materials that are resilient. This includes resilience to extreme temperatures. Finally, the House’s Transportation-Housing and Urban Development Appropriations bill calls on the Department of Transportation to ensure materials for federal infrastructure projects meet standards for durability and resilience.

State of the Future: What Comes Next for Heat Policy

Looking ahead, it is essential that the federal government maintains its role as a data collector, steward, and analyst, supports heat-related research and development, supports social services for the most vulnerable American households facing extreme heat. and continues to make investments in state, local, territorial, and tribal (SLTT) governments and their heat mitigation infrastructure and preparedness capacity. At the same time, SLTT governments are rapidly innovating in heat policy, and will be sites of innovation to watch this next year. Our team is tracking promising signs in three key areas:

More places are standing up heat governance infrastructure. A growing number of state, regional, and local plans acknowledge extreme heat as a risk; at the same time, more and more communities are developing standalone heat preparedness, response, or action plans (see heatplans.org to learn more, and read our “Framework for a Heat Ready Nation” to learn about progress in the Sunbelt region). New heat plans that launched in 2025 include Lincoln-Lancaster Heat Response Plan, the Low Country Heat Action Plan Toolkit, Orange County, NC’s Heat Action Plan, and King County’s Extreme Heat Mitigation Strategy. Many more plans are in the development pipeline. Further, more networks of local governments, including the Ten Across Network and Climate Mayors, are making heat technical assistance a priority.

More places are expanding their extreme heat protections. Policies that protect people from extreme heat exposure inside of their homes, inside of schools, and at the workplace are also starting to see uptake. LA County set an indoor temperature maximum of 82°F for rental units, creating a legal right to cooling for tenants. Meanwhile, the state of California recently enacted a law that all homes should be able to attain and maintain safe indoor temperatures, without specifying that limit. New Jersey now restricts utilities from shutting off the power due to non-payment from June 15 through August 31; New Jersey is also providing direct utility relief to New Jersey ratepayers. New York State became the first state in the country to regulate extreme heat in schools, setting a maximum temperature threshold of 88F for safe school operations. Finally, in Boston and in New Orleans, ordinances passed that require basic protections from heat, like rest breaks, for all city workers and city contractors. Scaling up these policies that minimize heat overexposure will be critical to be ready for hotter heat seasons to come.

Regional networks are forming to advance evidence-based public health measures. In light of rollbacks to public health infrastructure at the federal level, two regional networks have formed to coordinate across state public health departments, the West Coast Health Alliance and the Northeast Public Health Collaborative. While the initial focus is on developing evidence-based recommendations on vaccines and combining forces on vaccine procurement for their populations, we will be tracking how these networks address other public health efforts under threat, such as the health risks of extreme heat.

Protecting Americans from extreme heat will require a multiplicity of leadership across the levels of government in the United States and the capacity to connect hundreds of diverse organizations and experts around a shared solution set. To meet this moment, FAS will develop the 2026 State & Local Heat Policy Agenda, a blueprint for polycentric action towards a Heat Ready Nation. The 2026 Heat Policy Agenda will align the growing heat community around a shared set of objectives and equip state and local decision makers with the strategies they can deploy for heat season 2026 and beyond. We are focused on strategies that (1) build government capacity to address the threat of extreme heat and (2) ensure every American can be safe from heat in their homes, in their workplaces, and in their communities.

Over the next couple of months, the FAS team will be documenting the policy levers available at the state and local levels to address extreme heat and crafting model guidance, model executive orders, model legislation, and financing models.

Jen Kiggans Advocates For Permitting Reform - The Business Download |,Greg Herrigel,,,,,https://thebusinessdownload.com/rep-jen-kiggans-advocates-for-permitting-reform/,"Rep. Kiggans and Milito noted that more than 35 vessels have already been built, and 23 more have been announced or are currently under construction.
“These aren’t theoretical investments,” explain Rep. Kiggans and Milito.
“That is precisely the kind of domestic production that both sides of the aisle should support,” Rep. Kiggans and Milito said.
“We must move quickly to ensure Americans have the power to meet surging electric demand,” Rep. Kiggans and Milito wrote.
Rep. Kiggans and Milito acknowledge that for the permitting legislation to pass in the Senate, it must clear the 60-vote cloture threshold.","“From the Gulf Coast to the waters off Virginia, offshore energy is powering our economy and strengthening national security… Right now, companies want to invest across a range of technologies: oil and gas, wind, carbon capture, hydrogen, nuclear, geothermal and deep-sea mining. These projects represent billions in private investment, hundreds of thousands of jobs and the next generation of U.S. energy leadership,” reflected Rep. Jen Kiggans (R-VA-02) and National Ocean Industries Association (NOIA) President Erik Milito in an op-ed published in The Hill. “But if we want this momentum to last through future administrations, we must fix our broken permitting system.”

In the opinion piece, the authors reflected on the country’s potential for energy leadership. Offshore energy development is spurring domestic investment along the nation’s coasts, which Rep. Kiggans and Milito label “a story of industrial revitalization.” They highlight shipbuilding as an industry that has particularly benefited from this trend. As of the end of last year, the Oceantic Network totalled $1.8 billion in American shipbuilding contracts to support the offshore wind industry, creating more than 3,000 jobs for workers such as steelworkers and welders. Rep. Kiggans and Milito noted that more than 35 vessels have already been built, and 23 more have been announced or are currently under construction.

A significant amount of investment is also flowing into America’s ports along the East and Gulf coasts. Of the $12 billion in announced investments into America’s offshore wind industry, the American Clean Power Association (ACP) calculated nearly $3 billion to be allocated for ports. The Virginia Port Authority alone spent $223 million to upgrade the Portsmouth Marine Terminal with the help of a $20 million grant from the U.S. Department of Transportation. These upgrades enable Dominion Energy to transport equipment and infrastructure to its 176-turbine Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind project, located approximately 27 miles offshore.

“These aren’t theoretical investments,” explain Rep. Kiggans and Milito. “They are real, made-in-America projects rebuilding our industrial base, reinforcing supply chains and strengthening maritime capabilities.”

Meanwhile, Wood Mackenzie estimates that deepwater oil producers in the Gulf will add 300,000 barrels per day this year and an additional 250,000 barrels next year. This uptick will swell production to more than 2 million barrels daily, a 40% increase since 2020. The National Ocean Industries Association (NOIA) reported in 2023 that the carbon intensity of production in the Gulf is 46% lower than the global average outside the U.S. and Canada, making it more environmentally friendly than other producing countries, such as Russia, China, Brazil, Iran, Iraq, and Nigeria.

“That is precisely the kind of domestic production that both sides of the aisle should support,” Rep. Kiggans and Milito said. “Offshore energy is not a zero-sum game; it’s additive. We need all forms of energy. Oil and gas projects in the Gulf can produce for decades, while offshore wind will continue to ramp up and build a reliable supply for other coastal areas.”

All of these forms of offshore energy will play a crucial role in addressing growing energy demand, which the authors attribute to a combination of population growth and the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution. The International Energy Agency expects data centers to be responsible for nearly half of the growth in energy demand in the U.S. by 2030. By that time, they will consume more electricity than all energy-intensive manufacturing sectors combined. Virginia’s Loudon County, also known as “Data Centre Alley,” is just one region that will require as much secure and scalable power as possible, with 200 completed facilities spanning 49 million square feet. “We must move quickly to ensure Americans have the power to meet surging electric demand,” Rep. Kiggans and Milito wrote.

At the same time, Rep. Kiggans and Milito highlighted the various factors that contribute to long project development timelines and delays. For example, they explained that the deepwater oil projects in the Gulf can take at least a decade to plan and require billions of dollars of investment. “But both time and money depend on regulatory certainty. When that slips, so can production and investment in the U.S.,” they added.

They also acknowledged that although the intentions behind the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) were admirable, it now results in years-long delays stemming from administrative reviews and litigation: “The bottom line: projects stall, costs rise, investment dries up and America loses ground.”

The authors concluded that “we need bipartisan, durable and foundational permitting reform that protects U.S. energy leadership, provides legal certainty and ensures progress survives as presidents change.” They wrote that the bipartisan Streamlining Procurement for Effective Execution and Delivery (SPEED) Act “is a step in the right direction.” Introduced by Rep. Mike Rogers (R-AL-03), the provisions include limiting standing for civil actions to individuals who substantively participated in the public comment period and instituting a statute of limitations for NEPA cases.

Rep. Kiggans and Milito acknowledge that for the permitting legislation to pass in the Senate, it must clear the 60-vote cloture threshold. “Fortunately, there is broad agreement that the current system is broken and reform is overdue,” they said. “We have a bipartisan imperative to act. Smart, targeted reform will unlock offshore energy investments that generate billions in revenue, strengthen energy security, support high-wage jobs and ensure American leadership in a competitive global energy landscape.”",https://thebusinessdownload.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/483892016_641744858796298_4503683068630223356_n-1-e1760536533445.jpg,N,,2025-10-15 12:13:32.513441

""Responsible energy development on public lands strengthens America's energy security, powers our economy and supports state and local conservation efforts.""","Oct. 15 (UPI) -- The Trump administration has vowed to open up public land to usher in an age of American energy dominance but in the Western United States there is little frontier left.

More than 81% of public lands administered by the Bureau of Land Management in the Western United States are already open for oil and gas production leasing, according to a report by The Wilderness Society, a nonprofit organization focused on conservation.

The U.S. Geological Survey estimates that there is much more oil and gas that can be extracted from federally managed public lands, according to a report published in June. It estimates there are 29.4 billion barrels of oil and 391.6 trillion cubic feet of gas that are technically recoverable, meaning they can be produced using currently available technology and industry practices.

""This is an acceleration and amplification of what we saw in the energy dominance agenda under the first Trump administration,"" Ben Tettlebaum, director and senior staff attorney for the Wilderness Society, told UPI. ""What is distinct right now is its claim for wanting so-called energy dominance, particularly leveraging our shared public lands for that use. It seems it's trying to leverage that use above all others.""

The focus of President Donald Trump is not on the lower 48 states alone. Last week, Trump approved the Ambler Road project, a 211-mile industrial road that will cross the Gates of the Arctic National Park and Preserve.

The road will be used to enable trucks and equipment to access the Ambler Mining District, a region in Northwestern Alaska with copper, zinc, gold, lead and silver deposits.

The U.S. government has reached an agreement with Trilogy Metals, a mineral mining company based in Vancouver that operates in the Ambler Mining District. According to the White House and Trilogy Metals, the U.S. Department of War will invest $35.6 million in the company, making it a 10% shareholder as part of the agreement. It will also have the future option to purchase

Trilogy Metals is partnered with Ambler Metals in a joint agreement to mine in the Ambler district.

Last year, the Biden administration blocked the Ambler Road project. President Joe Biden said the project was blocked to protect 28 million acres of land and Native communities in Alaska.

The move by the Trump administration reverses course on Biden-era efforts to maintain public lands. It also marks the second high-profile instance of the U.S. government buying a stake in a private company under the Trump administration.

In August, the Trump administration purchased a 10% stake in chip manufacturer Intel.

The U.S. government has invested in private companies on rare occasions though the circumstances in this instance are unique. Notably those were domestic companies, unlike Trilogy Metals.

The government invests in American companies when there is a risk of those companies collapsing, such as banks and vehicle manufacturers during the Great Recession. Those investments were tied to a government interest: avoiding further economic hardship. They were also temporary investments with recipients of government assistance required to pay the government back.

In the case of the Ambler Road project, the White House cited a public interest in accessing critical minerals domestically.

""[American Petroleum Institute] continues to welcome the administration's efforts to restore a pro-development approach to land use and leverage our nation's vast resources,"" Tim Charters, director of upstream policy for the American Petroleum Institute, told UPI. ""Responsible energy development on public lands strengthens America's energy security, powers our economy and supports state and local conservation efforts.""

The Permian Basin in Southeast New Mexico and West Texas is a hotspot for oil drilling and industry experts told UPI it will see increased attention as the Trump administration invites more energy production.

Eli Hilbert, organizing director at Texas Permian Future Generations, told UPI residents of the basin are deeply tied to the oil industry. Most of them are supportive of the president's desire to increase production. Yet volatility in the industry ushered in by Trump's tariff and international policies is dragging down oil prices and causing layoffs.

""Oil was staying pretty steady at $70 to $72 a barrel until Trump announced tariffs,"" Hilbert said. ""Ever since it's been up and down between $70 and $55. They still support Donald Trump, who is leading energy in the direction of more layoffs and less drilling.""

ConocoPhillips announced last month that it will lay off about 25% of its workforce by the end of the year.

Earlier this year, Chevron announced it would lay off 15 to 20% of its workforce.

While jobs come and go as the oil market fluctuates, the effects of drilling are long lasting. If and when drilling ends at a site, maintenance of the drill site must continue indefinitely.

""We will need to maintain these oil wells forever,"" Hilbert said. ""There are tens of thousands in West Texas we're going to have to plug and check for millenia. We could employ every single person working in oil doing that for the next 100 years. The problem is there's no money in that.""

Hilbert adds that many who work in the oil business are not concerned with the environmental or health effects associated with drilling.

""The problem is people don't really live in Midland and Odessa [Texas] for long periods of time,"" Hilbert. ""It's a place you come, make your money and leave.""

Texans have seen what happens when abandoned oil wells are not plugged and maintained. The artificial lake, covering 60 acres of land, is filled with toxic water due to a leaking oil well. It spews hundreds of gallons of toxic wastewater per minute and has been doing so for more than 20 years.

""It smells terrible. It has dangerous levels of hydrogen sulfide,"" Hilbert said. ""Because nobody took care of it 20 years ago, it's ballooned into a huge problem.""

A struggle has persisted over the years to determine who is responsible for the cleanup. The Railroad Commission, the state agency responsible for regulating the oil and gas industry, and the county water district are in a dispute over which body is responsible for plugging the well.",https://cdnph.upi.com/sv/ph/og/upi/8411760534258/2025/1/3886f3146b270c653812c890efe4b5d8/v1.5/Most-public-land-already-open-to-energy-production-Trump-wants-more.jpg,N,,2025-10-15 12:13:36.199497

Second, this of course is not the only challenge we face in our energy system.
It is homegrown clean energy, which cannot be weaponised by dictators or petrostates, giving us much greater energy sovereignty.","Let me start by offering sincere thanks for Energy UK for hosting this conference.

And I want to thank Dhara [Vyas] for your leadership over the last year as CEO, can you join me in giving this tribute.

You are a brilliant champion of this industry.

Coming here today I am once again reminded that it is an incredibly exciting time for the energy sector.

Wherever you work, there is a sense of huge possibility for the future—and I want to thank you all for the work you are doing.

And I am incredibly proud of everything we have achieved together over the last 15 months, it has only been possible because of our work together, including:

Consenting record amounts of clean energy, enough to power the equivalent of more than 7.5 million homes—including just today Tillbridge solar farm, which alone will power hundreds of thousands of homes.

We are ending the first come first served grid connections queue.

Introducing the biggest reform of planning in a generation.

Setting up Great British Energy.

Investing in the biggest nuclear building programme in half a century.

And kickstarting our carbon capture and hydrogen industries.

None of this would have been possible without your advice, support and delivery.

All these achievements speaks to a wider purpose, which I believe unites so many people in this room.

Building our country’s clean energy future as part of a bigger vision of a fairer, more prosperous economy.

Soon we’ll publish our Clean Energy Jobs Plan, which will show not just the hundreds of thousands of good jobs that already exist in this sector, but also the hundreds of thousands of new jobs we expect to be created by 2030. This making a difference.

But of course, we also know that creating an economy for the many involves tackling the long-running cost of living crisis that so many people face.

And that’s what I want to focus on today.

We will be judged on the success of our mission in delivering for consumers, and rightly so.

My case today is this:

First, our exposure to fossil fuel markets remains the Achilles heel of our energy system, keeping bills high and giving us no long-term certainty over price.

Second, that we face further challenges of historic under-investment in our energy system and growing electricity demand. The choice for the future is therefore what kind of energy system we want to build, not whether we want to build it at all.

Third, building clean energy is the right choice for the country because, despite the challenges, it is the only route to a system that can reliably bring down bills for good, and give us clean energy abundance.

Fourth, as we build this new infrastructure, the government is determined to work with you to bring the benefits to families and businesses as quickly as possible.

First, memories can be short in Westminster.

But we should never forget the huge damage to family finances, business finances and the public finances caused by the energy shock we have been through in recent years—a shock that still reverberates today.

And the reason for this damage is because the UK was and is so exposed to international fossil fuel markets due to our dependence on gas across the economy.

Even today, wholesale gas costs for households are still 75% higher than before the energy crisis.

If they were at pre-crisis levels, bills would be more than £200 a year lower than they are today for families.

The same story applies to business.

Industrial electricity prices soared at the start of the energy crisis and have remained stuck at high levels.

So while it is true we have inherited a system of paying for network and other costs which is less weighted towards public spending than other countries, a large part of the issue facing industry in the UK is our exposure to fossil fuels.

As UK Steel said earlier this year when talking about why energy intensive industries like theirs pay higher electricity prices in the UK than our European competitors:

“The main driver of the price disparity is now wholesale electricity costs, driven by the UK’s reliance on natural gas power generation.”

Going back further, this has been a long-standing weakness at the heart of the British economy and society, with half of our recessions since 1970 caused by fossil fuel shocks.

And looking forward it remains a massive risk, particularly at a time of global instability.

According to the Office for Budget Responsibility, if gas price spikes occurred even once every decade, it could cost the UK between 2 to 3% of GDP annually.

So anyone who tells you we can solve the issues of energy security and affordability without addressing our reliance on fossil fuels seems to me to be ignoring the evidence before our eyes and this country’s painful recent experience.

Second, this of course is not the only challenge we face in our energy system.

In the years ahead, we expect a massive increase in electricity demand—around 50% by 2035 and a more than doubling by 2050.

This is a massive opportunity for us.

We want as a country to seize the opportunities of electric vehicles that are cheaper to run, new industries such as AI, and the benefits of electrification across the economy.

But this task is made harder by the legacy of decades of under-investment in energy in this country to overcome.

Whatever power sources they favour, people need to confront this reality.

Much of the UK’s current nuclear fleet began operating in the 1980s and we haven’t brought a new nuclear power station onto the system since Sizewell B 30 years ago.

At the same time, according to NESO, half the existing gas fleet has already been operating for over 20 years.

To listen to some people talk, you would think there was a free pass to just carry on using unlimited gas from existing stations for the next few decades, but that is simply not the case.

Of course, we could decide to stop building renewables and just rely on a whole new fleet of gas-fired power stations, but we need to be candid that this would involve the costs of building not just operating these plants.

And the underinvestment we face isn’t just about generation:

Much of the electricity grid was built in the 1960s and hasn’t been upgraded since.

So the reality is there is no alternative to investment in both generation and the network to keep the power system running and seize the opportunities and meet the needs of the future.

If the question therefore is not whether to build but what to build, the third part of my remarks is about why the government believes clean power is the right choice for the country.

Let’s be absolutely clear what the cheapest sources of power are in this country, according to levelised cost estimates.

Solar power and onshore wind.

Strike prices for solar and onshore wind in our last auction, AR6, were nearly 50% cheaper than the levelised cost estimate to build and operate a new gas plant.

Offshore wind, despite global cost pressures, was also cheaper than new gas.

At a systems level, the prize of a renewables-based system, supported by nuclear and other technologies, is clear:

It gets us off the fossil fuel rollercoaster, reducing our exposure as a country. Clean power 2030 will mean volatile gas sets the wholesale electricity price much less often than today.

It is homegrown clean energy, which cannot be weaponised by dictators or petrostates, giving us much greater energy sovereignty.

And it will significantly lower the wholesale costs of electricity, which will benefit heavy industry and has the potential to bring down consumer bills for good.

At the same time, of course, wholesale prices aren’t the only costs paid for by consumers, and we need to fund investment in energy infrastructure—including in the upgrade that is now sorely needed because of previous neglect.

In 2023 the previous government estimated four times as much transmission infrastructure needed to be built by the end of the decade as had been built since 1990.

That network infrastructure is what is now being delivered under this government.

Even taking this investment into account, the independent Climate Change Committee was clear in its Carbon Budget 7 advice:

“As the electricity system decarbonises, with wind and solar displacing unabated gas, the underlying costs of electricity supply are expected to fall over time.”

Of course, in this majority renewables system we are building, we will need a mix of energy technologies.

That is why we are driving forward on renewables, nuclear, storage, CCUS, hydrogen, and gas will continue to play an important backup role for some time to come.

Now as I have said, people are entitled to advocate for more fossil fuels and less, or even no more renewables as part of this mix.

But here is the reality:

They would leave us more exposed because we don’t control the price.

They are more expensive to build and operate.

They would leave us losing out in the global race for the jobs, investment and industries of the future.

And they would drive a coach and horses through our efforts to tackle the climate crisis.

That is why we believe that clean power is the right choice for the country.

And the task ahead is to bear down on the costs of building, which face significant upward pressures, and work relentlessly to translate the lower wholesale costs of clean power into lower bills for consumers.

As we face these challenges, we are looking at all the tools at our disposal:

How public investment can help reduce costs, as we are doing through Sizewell C, for example.

Using Reformed National Pricing to plan and build a more efficient system, which provides the right incentives to build the right generation in the right places. This is crucial to reduce constraint costs.

And relentlessly focussing on value for money in each and every decision, as we have done for example by halving the subsidy for Drax power generation.

And this approach will be what we apply to the upcoming auction round, AR7, and beyond, where delivering value for money is our top priority.

We have made reforms to the auction to maximise competition between bidders and reduce the costs to consumers.

And there are multiple pathways and technology mixes that can get us to clean power 2030.

I want to be clear:

We won’t buy at any price and if specific technologies aren’t competitive, we will look elsewhere.

We will take the long-term decisions to secure the right amount of capacity at the right price for the country.

In the coming weeks I will set the initial budget for AR7, working with the Treasury, and we will only go beyond it if it delivers clear value for money.

As we drive towards clean power, we know that many are struggling with their bills now.

And that takes me to the fourth part of my remarks about what we are doing to help families and businesses.

This winter we are expanding the Warm Home Discount to give nearly three million more families on the lowest incomes £150 off their energy bills.

We are increasing support for 7,000 energy intensive businesses.

And we will shortly publish our Warm Homes Plan, kicking off Britain’s biggest programme of home upgrades in generations.

Backed by £13.2 billion of public investment to upgrade up to 5 million homes over this parliament.

The Warm Homes Plan will help families with the costs of solar, batteries, heat pumps and insulation to lower bills and tackle fuel poverty.

In this room, we all know the potential this has to bring the benefit of clean electricity to people and lower their bills.

This is something consumers with the means to do so are already taking advantage of.

We want to spread those benefits much more widely so that this is not just a privilege for those who can afford it.

Alongside this, we will reform the system of consumer protection and advice to help families make the choices that work for them and ensure the highest standards of installation.

We also want to go further.

That is why we will ensure new homes are built with solar and clean heating as standard.

A common-sense policy which has been demanded by the public, championed by this industry, and will be delivered with the Future Homes Standard.

And we don’t just want to stop at new homes.

Solar power offers a cheap and quick way for people to generate their own energy and cut their bills by hundreds of pounds a year.

Currently just 1.5 million homes—around 1 in 20—have solar panels installed.

This is a massive opportunity to cut bills using the free resource of the sun.

I am determined to extend this possibility to millions more families and I want to work with you to do it.

So this is our plan: pursuing clean power by 2030 and bringing the benefits to families as quickly as possible to help with the pressures of affordability that so many face.

The final point I want to make is this.

There are two roads opening up for Britain, in a way that hasn’t been true for the last two decades.

One road, a sprint to clean power—a partnership between industry and government.

The other road, doubling down on our exposure to fossil fuels and turning our back not just on the progress in clean energy of the last 15 months but on the partnership of government and business over many decades.

Going down this road would lose:

The good jobs from the best economic opportunity of the 21st century.

The energy security and sovereignty within our reach.

And of course, our efforts on the climate crisis.

Indeed, waving the white flag in the climate fight would mean we were rightly held in infamy by future generations.

Now of course the breakdown of this consensus poses a challenge to our shared agenda.

I am really confident we can persuade people that the road we have chosen is the right one.

Because the country wants a positive vision and hope for the future and you are all in the hope business. I spoke to an apprentice at Sizewell C and he was buzzing about the opportunity and there will be many others.

This country wants hope and optimism.

Because it is in our economic interests as a country.

And because it is the answer to the affordability challenges that families and businesses face.

I feel humbled to be Energy Secretary.

Together I am determined we will make the right decisions in the months and years ahead to show the British people how our shared agenda can deliver for them.",https://www.gov.uk/assets/frontend/govuk-opengraph-image-4196a4d6333cf92aaf720047f56cfd91b3532d7635fc21ebcf0d5897df6b5f77.png,N,,2025-10-15 12:12:01.016484

The survey suggests that success requires production systems built for rapid technology iteration, dual-powertrain flexibility and feature democratisation across price segments.","China's automotive market is sending a clear signal to global manufacturers: the old playbook no longer works. A comprehensive survey of 2,498 Chinese consumers, conducted by McKinsey between the fourth quarter of 2024 and first quarter of 2025, reveals fundamental shifts in buyer preferences that carry profound implications for production strategies worldwide.

The findings challenge several assumptions that have guided manufacturing investment decisions. Most significantly, the relentless price competition that has dominated headlines is delivering diminishing returns. Despite discount rates in the internal combustion engine (ICE) market rising by nearly eight percentage points in 2024 compared with 2023, and electric vehicle (EV) discounts increasing by nearly five percentage points, the net stimulus effect on consumer demand grew by a mere 0.6 percentage points, from 3.0 percent to 3.6 percent.

Innovation outpaces discounting

By contrast, consumers responded far more enthusiastically to accelerated product development cycles. The survey found that shortened release cycles for new models and technologies generated a net stimulus effect of 10.8 percent, three times higher than price competition. This gap widens further among higher-income consumers, where the innovation stimulus reaches 22.9 percent.

For manufacturing operations, this suggests that flexible production systems capable of rapid model changeovers and technology integration will deliver better returns than capacity dedicated to cost reduction alone. The ability to bring new features to market quickly is becoming a more valuable manufacturing capability than the ability to produce cheaply.

Stellantis stakes $13bn on US manufacturing renaissance

The transatlantic carmaker's largest-ever domestic commitment signals a decisive pivot towards US production, promising five new vehicles and 5,000 jobs as it pursues a 50% capacity expansion across the industrial Midwest.

The brand landscape is undergoing equally dramatic transformation. Twenty new brands have emerged since 2021, each achieving monthly sales exceeding 1,000 units, whilst nine incumbent brands have exited. Yet the average number of brands in consumers' initial consideration sets has grown only modestly, from 2.5 in 2021 to 3.4 in 2024. This creates a winner-takes-most dynamic where manufacturing capacity must either align with emerging leaders or risk underutilisation.

Heritage versus technology

Traditional premium German brands maintain strong luxury recognition, scoring between 4.5 and 4.8 on a five-point scale. However, this perception advantage is failing to translate into EV sales. When asked about EV brands specifically, Chinese manufacturers dominate consumer awareness. Premium German brands that once led consideration sets in the overall market show markedly weaker performance in the EV segment.

The survey identifies why: Chinese consumers now rank brand heritage as only marginally more important than objective factors such as safety and manoeuvrability when defining premium brands. The heritage advantage stands at just four percentage points over safety considerations. More tellingly, among high-income consumers and residents of tier-one cities, brand heritage carries even less weight.

This shift has direct manufacturing implications. Investment in advanced battery technologies, autonomous driving systems and smart cabin features is proving more critical than maintaining traditional production centres associated with legacy brand prestige. Chinese manufacturers account for eight of the top ten brands in autonomous driving perception, nine of ten in advanced electric powertrain technology, and eight of ten in smart cockpit capabilities.

The plug-in hybrid surprise

Perhaps the most unexpected finding concerns powertrain preferences. Whilst global attention has focused on battery electric vehicle (BEV) adoption, the survey reveals growing appeal for plug-in hybrid and extended-range EVs. The regret rate among pure BEV owners who purchased more than three years ago has risen to 32 percent in 2024 from 22 percent in 2023. Even recent BEV buyers show a 13 percent regret rate.

Europe’s carmakers cut production as overcapacity bites

Stellantis, Volkswagen, and Ford are pausing production at multiple plants across Europe amid falling demand, rising inventories, and shrinking market share. With utilisation rates dropping, industry-wide plant closures are beginning to look inevitable.

By contrast, plug-in hybrid and extended-range vehicle owners maintain regret rates around 10 percent regardless of ownership duration. The primary driver is charging infrastructure: China's vehicle-to-charging-pile ratio deteriorated from 7.1:1 in 2023 to 8.4:1 in 2024, whilst the ratio of new vehicles to new charging piles jumped from 7.8:1 to 12.6:1.

Manufacturing operations must adapt accordingly. The survey found that 81 percent of potential EV buyers in 2024 included plug-in hybrids or extended-range vehicles in their consideration sets, up from 71 percent in 2023. This dual-powertrain approach requires different production capabilities than pure BEV manufacturing, particularly in managing complexity across battery, motor and ICE systems.

Notably, plug-in hybrid and extended-range vehicle owners use pure-electric mode for approximately 50 percent of their driving, far exceeding the roughly 20 percent that electric-only range represents of total vehicle range. Nearly half of owners report preferring charging to refuelling, with only 2 percent never charging. This behaviour pattern validates the technology's environmental credentials whilst accommodating infrastructure limitations.

Technology democratisation reshapes differentiation

The survey reveals surging consumer awareness of autonomous driving features, with exposure increasing substantially between 2023 and 2024. Users of city-based navigation-on-autopilot features grew from 23 percent to 45 percent of those with autonomous driving experience. Satisfaction rates improved across all feature levels, and the proportion wanting upgrades to more sophisticated systems increased.

This democratisation of advanced features creates new manufacturing challenges. Long electric range, fast charging capability and autonomous driving are now considered indispensable even among price-conscious buyers of vehicles costing between 100,000 and 150,000 renminbi (between $13,800 and $20,700). Traditional differentiators such as air suspension and rear-wheel steering gain importance only at higher price points.

Driving quality forward: Why digitalisation is transforming automotive manufacturing

In this AMS webinar, we’ll explore how digitalisation and automation are redefining quality in automotive manufacturing — from digital measurement to embedding quality directly into production lines.

For production planning, this implies that advanced technology integration must extend deep into volume segments rather than remaining exclusive to premium lines. Manufacturing systems need the flexibility to incorporate sophisticated features across price ranges whilst maintaining cost discipline.

The implications extend beyond China. As the world's largest automotive market and increasingly its innovation laboratory, Chinese consumer preferences are likely to influence global demand patterns. Manufacturing footprints optimised for yesterday's priorities risk obsolescence as these preferences spread. The survey suggests that success requires production systems built for rapid technology iteration, dual-powertrain flexibility and feature democratisation across price segments. Those capabilities matter more than traditional economies of scale or brand heritage.",https://image.automotivemanufacturingsolutions.com/1589113.jpg?imageId=1589113&x=0&y=0&cropw=100&croph=100&panox=0&panoy=0&panow=100&panoh=100&width=1200&height=683,N,,2025-10-15 12:12:32.870991

But now, STX will formally match the MBTA’s methane fuel consumption with specific RINs.
While methane-fueled buses produce fewer tailpipe emissions than a diesel bus, methane still generates carbon dioxide when it's burned, and the methane drilling and pipeline system itself is a major source of planet-heating pollution.
An MBTA spokesperson told StreetsblogMASS that the overhaul project is currently underway.
The MBTA spokesperson also told StreetsblogMASS that the agency currently does not have plans to reduce its use of methane fuels over the next 5 years.","Last month, the MBTA announced a new partnership that would let the agency participate in a federal biofuel incentive program – but in a way that won't change its bus fleet or the kinds of fuel it consumes.

The T plans to partner with the STX Group, a commodities trading firm, to participate in the Federal Renewable Fuel Standard (RFSII) program.

That program, established in 2005 during George W. Bush's presidency, requires fuel refiners and importers to produce a certain volume of ""renewable"" fuels that aren't drilled out of the ground.

The Environmental Protection Agency tracks compliance with tradable credits called “Renewable Identification Numbers,” or RINs, that represent a certain volume of renewable fuel production. Companies that produce biofuel can sell their RINs to fossil fuel companies to help them meet their quotas.

Critically, an RIN can only fulfill those quotas after the credit has been ""retired,"" or used. That's where the MBTA comes in.

The MBTA's methane-fueled buses consume 200 billion BTUs of energy each year, which is roughly 200 million cubic feet of gas (editor's note: The fossil fuel industry markets methane gas as ""natural"" gas – a term that can mislead the public into believing that the fuel is clean or environmentally benign. StreetsblogMASS refers to the fuel by its primary chemical component and source of energy, which is methane).

Most of that methane is fracked from underground wells. However, a small portion is ""biogas"" that's captured from decomposing organic matter in landfills, sewage treatment plants, and farms. When that happens, the biogas generates an RIN, and the recovered methane often gets injected into the national network of gas distribution pipelines, where it's mixed with fossil methane and delivered to customers like the T.

An MBTA spokesperson explained that the MBTA will continue to use the same fuel as before, with the same methane-fueled buses. The contract with STX will not change anything about the price the T pays for that fuel, or how it's delivered.

But now, STX will formally match the MBTA’s methane fuel consumption with specific RINs.

""This transaction structure allows the MBTA to participate in the RIN marketplace without any operational changes to its existing bus fleet or exposure to future price volatility in the RIN marketplace,"" an MBTA spokesperson explained.

The agency expects to receive $800,000 per year from STX over the course of its 5-year contract.

To put that in context, in fiscal year 2025, the T spent approximately $2 million on methane fuels, a spokesperson told StreetsblogMASS.

Electric buses on pause

The new contract is part of a pause for the MBTA's wider decarbonization strategy.

While methane-fueled buses produce fewer tailpipe emissions than a diesel bus, methane still generates carbon dioxide when it's burned, and the methane drilling and pipeline system itself is a major source of planet-heating pollution.

The state's climate laws require the MBTA to procure only zero-emission buses starting in 2031, and to operate only zero-emission buses after December 31, 2040.

The MBTA currently operates about 175 methane-fueled buses that were manufactured in 2016 and 2017.

120 of those buses are based out of the agency's Arborway bus depot in Jamaica Plain, and 55 are based at Cabot Yard in South Boston (pictured at the top of this article), according to the NETransit vehicle roster.

Until recently, the T had been planning to phase out most of those vehicles by the end of the decade, and had been designing a new maintenance garage designed for a new fleet of zero-emission electric buses at its Arborway bus depot.

But the Massachusetts Legislature and Governor Maura Healey haven't put up any of the necessary funding to implement the MBTA's electric bus plans. This spring, the T removed the Arborway garage construction project from its 5-year capital plan, citing a lack of funding.

Meanwhile, the new capital budget added a new $54 million project to overhaul all 175 methane-fueled buses in the MBTA fleet – a project that would keep the vehicles in service well into the new decade.

An MBTA spokesperson told StreetsblogMASS that the overhaul project is currently underway.

The MBTA spokesperson also told StreetsblogMASS that the agency currently does not have plans to reduce its use of methane fuels over the next 5 years.",https://lede-admin.mass.streetsblog.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/49/2025/10/CNG-fuelling-at-MBTA-Cabot-Garage-10.10.2025.jpg,N,,2025-10-15 10:03:37.272456

But Amy Mooney, Founder of Mutha Cuva, is turning that assumption on its head.
The funding will enable Mutha Cuva to onboard its first 1,000 homes, build a brilliant small team, and scale the platform to launch nationally.
Lead Investor, Advisor and Non-Executive Director, Simon Moyle, said: “Mutha Cuva will become a pioneer showing the way forward.
“There is also something very powerful about building this from the North East.","For years, many founders have believed that raising equity in the North East is next to impossible – particularly for women and those in emerging sectors like climate tech. But Amy Mooney, Founder of Mutha Cuva, is turning that assumption on its head.

From sceptic to champion

Amy is no stranger to building businesses. She co-founded, scaled, and sold a digital agency before investing in and growing a renewable heating company. But when it came to launching her third venture – a subscription-based heat pump servicing platform – she faced a new challenge: raising equity investment for the first time.

Amy explains: “I didn’t know anything about equity and angel investment, and thought it wasn’t for me. I’d always bootstrapped and reinvested profits. Everyone told me raising in the North East would be impossible, especially as a female founder in climate tech, so I went to London for my first investor.”

It was through conversations with James Robson MBE that Amy was introduced to the Pathways to Funding programme and Northern Investor Hub, delivered by Innovation SuperNetwork and powered by UMi. That introduction, she says, changed everything.

The right support at the right time

The programme provided expert input from advisors like Andrew Hodgson, who helped sense-check Amy’s business plan, pitch deck, and financial model, adding the crucial investor lens. Amy was also invited to pitch at a Womble Bond Dickinson event, where she connected with investor Victoria Taylor, who went on to introduce her to further networks.

Behind the scenes, UMi’s financial experts helped extend Amy’s forecasts, building an integrated five-year model covering P&L, balance sheet, and cashflow. And when complex negotiations came up, she had a team she could turn to for advice and confidence.

“I felt I wasn’t alone. As a solo founder new to raising, that made all the difference. The support has been incredible, and it’s helped me secure the majority of my investment here in the North East – something I never thought possible.”

Fuel for growth – and the region’s future

Amy has now closed her £250,000 SEIS pre-seed round, with most investors coming from the region. The funding will enable Mutha Cuva to onboard its first 1,000 homes, build a brilliant small team, and scale the platform to launch nationally. More broadly, she says, it will contribute to reduced carbon emissions, supporting the UK’s transition to net zero and demonstrating the North East’s potential to lead the clean growth economy.

Lead Investor, Advisor and Non-Executive Director, Simon Moyle, said:

“Mutha Cuva will become a pioneer showing the way forward. It is exactly the kind of tech-enabled business, rooted in customer need and delivering tangible outcomes, that I believe has the potential to scale rapidly and make a lasting impact.

“There is also something very powerful about building this from the North East. The region has an incredible tradition of engineering, innovation and resilience, and Mutha Cuva is showing that climate tech start-ups don’t need to be based in London to attract investment or talent. That is one of the reasons I was so keen to get involved.”

Investor Victoria Taylor, CEO of Probe Industries, said:“Mutha Cuva is exactly the kind of innovative, high-potential business we want to see thriving in the North East. Amy’s vision, combined with her deep sector knowledge and execution skills, made investing in her business an obvious choice. Her success demonstrates that the North East has a strong community of investors ready to back ambitious founders, and that this region is a place where equity funding can succeed.”

Looking back, Amy reflects on how far her perspective has shifted:

“If I hadn’t been introduced to Pathways to Funding and the Northern Investor Hub, I’d never have thought raising in the North East was worth my time. Now, I know it absolutely is, and I’m proud to say the majority of our backers are from right here.”

As Mutha Cuva gears up to scale, Amy’s story shows what’s possible when the right support, networks, and ambition come together – not only for one founder, but for the future of investment across the region.

“Amy’s success demonstrates perfectly why the Pathways to Funding programme exists,” said Karl Murray, Specialist Adviser at UMi. “Her raise shows there is strong appetite among investors to back North East businesses, and the Northern Investor Hub is here to help connect ambitious founders with these active investors.”

Phil Witcherley, Director of Economic Growth and Regeneration North East Combined Authority, said:

“Amy’s success with Mutha Cuva reflects the ambition, innovation and talent we’re proud to see across the North East. It also shows the strength of our region’s investment ecosystem, which is creating real opportunities for businesses to scale and thrive here. We want the North East to be the home of the green energy revolution, and we’re committed to supporting entrepreneurs like Amy who are driving clean energy, creating jobs and making a positive difference to communities.”

""The bad actors behind this illegal scheme must be held accountable for ignoring state and federal regulations. In accordance with state law, the TSSB should review our findings and refer this matter to me for further legal action.""

State investigations into EPIC City

The backstory:

EPIC City has drawn the attention of Governor Greg Abbott, Attorney General Ken Paxton and other Texas leaders.

The developers and East Plano Islamic Center have also been targeted by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, who sent a letter to CCP about the permits required to create a municipal utility district.

Gov. Greg Abbott has also asked the Texas Rangers to investigate the mosque and related businesses.

In a post about EPIC City on social media, Abbott commented, ""Sharia law is not allowed in Texas.""

The mosque was also sent a letter from the Texas Funeral Service Commission and has drawn the attention of the Texas Workforce Commission.

Related

Paxton opened an investigation into communications between EPIC and city officials in Plano, Richardson and Wylie. His office is also looking into CCP.

Dept. of Justice investigation

Sen. John Cornyn requested a DOJ investigation into EPIC City in April, bringing up concerns that the community could discriminate based on faith.

Cornyn sent the letter to Assistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon, the assistant attorney general for civil rights, asking the agency to look into possible discrimination against other religious groups.

The investigation was dropped in June.

In a letter to Community Capital Partners, Dhillon said the department was closing its investigation.

""CCP has affirmed that all will be welcome in any future development, and that you plan to revise and develop marketing materials to reinforce that message consistent with your obligations under the Fair Housing Act,"" Dhillon said in the June 13 letter. ""Based on this information, the Department is closing its investigation at this time.""

What is EPIC City?

EPIC City is a planned development near Josephine, Texas, about 40 miles northeast of Dallas.

The East Plano Islamic Center, or EPIC, is the organization behind the proposed development.

EPIC’s for-profit company, Community Capital Partners, purchased the 402 acres with the goal of building a mosque, along with 1,000 homes, townhomes, and apartments.

The development sold out its first phase of development, around 500 lots, within six months. Developers are still accepting investors for the second phase of the development.

Enacted in 2022 as part of the Inflation Reduction Act, CAMT imposes a 15% minimum tax on adjusted financial statement income (AFSI)—a measure based on financial statement income, with certain adjustments. This means that even if a company’s regular taxable liability is low, the company may still face a significant tax bill if it is subject to the CAMT (i.e., the company is an applicable corporation) and its AFSI remains high.

Prior to CAMT, deductions could result in substantial tax savings for a company. However, if those deductions do not also reduce AFSI, the company could unexpectedly cross into CAMT liability. While a credit for CAMT paid is available against regular tax liability, some companies could be perpetual CAMT taxpayers. Additionally, the use of CAMT credits is subject to various limitations (especially if the company has significant general business credits). This shift has had an impact on tax planning considerations, and companies may need to rethink or adapt their approach.

OBBBA: Flexibility and complexity

OBBBA provided certain expensing benefits and extended certain provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) that should result in cash-tax savings. However, these benefits may also result in complexity and potentially unintended consequences, inadvertently subjecting some to CAMT, thereby decreasing cash-tax savings. The main provisions of OBBBA that interact with CAMT include:

Section 174 (R&E Expenditures): OBBBA allows corporations to choose between immediately expensing domestic research and experimental (R&E) costs or capitalizing and amortizing them over time. This flexibility is a change from the previous mandatory capitalization rules since R&E costs generally are immediately expensed for book purposes. Transition rules also permit deduction of unamortized balances from prior years over one or two years, which could create a significant book-tax difference and result in a CAMT liability. While a company could elect to capitalize R&E costs to mitigate this difference, this may not align with a company’s objectives.

Section 163(j) (Interest Limitation): OBBBA changes the calculation of adjusted taxable income (ATI) by excluding depreciation and amortization. This allows companies to deduct more interest, which can reduce regular taxable income. However, there would not be a corresponding reduction in AFSI, which could make CAMT liability more likely.

FDII: OBBBA also significantly impacts foreign-derived intangible income (FDII), which is renamed foreign-derived deduction-eligible income (FDDEI), and is subject to a 14% tax rate. OBBBA allocates R&E costs and interest deductions away from FDDEI to income that is subject to a 21% tax rate. This can result in a company’s effective tax rate for regular tax being reduced below 15%, which correspondingly can result in a CAMT liability.

These changes mean that tax teams should not only understand the new rules but also anticipate how different choices may affect both regular tax and CAMT over time. Tax teams may need to undertake modeling exercises to gain a better understanding of the impact of the changes made by the OBBBA.

Foreign tax credits: Navigating new boundaries

CAMT includes a foreign tax credit mechanism, allowing corporations to offset CAMT liability with eligible foreign income taxes. The rules are nuanced:

US-level taxes: Income taxes paid by a US consolidated group are generally fully creditable against CAMT.

CFC-level taxes: Taxes paid by controlled foreign corporations (CFCs) are subject to a limitation—only up to 15% of the CFC’s AFSI can be credited, with excess taxes carried forward for up to five years.

Understanding the distinction between US and CFC-level taxes is critical for managing CAMT exposure, especially for multinational corporations. Ongoing statutory interpretation and proposed regulations may further influence how these credits are applied.

Partnerships: Complexity and relief

For corporations that own interests in partnerships, the CAMT rules are especially complex. However, recent IRS guidance, Notice 2025-28, has provided new elections and methods for calculating AFSI from a partnership investment under CAMT. These options aim to reduce compliance burdens but provide additional considerations with respect to tax planning. Under the statute, there are two partnership adjustments. These are the distributive share adjustments and transactions between partners and the partnership. The Notice provides several different elections for partners and the partnership in determining the two partnership adjustments. Careful analysis is a requirement to understand the impact, both retroactively and prospectively, on adopting these elections.

Modeling these scenarios is essential, as the chosen election may have long-term impacts for both CAMT and regular tax liability.

Modeling and accounting: The path forward

As the rules have evolved, one lesson stands out: Robust modeling is essential. Tax teams may want to consider simulating various scenarios to understand how OBBBA provisions and CAMT interact. This is especially relevant for:

FDDEI and other permanent differences: Favorable rules may push some corporations into perpetual CAMT liability.

General business credits (GBCs): The ordering rules for using CAMT credits can limit their usability, sometimes requiring a valuation allowance.

ASC 740 (Deferred Tax Assets): A corporation that expects to perpetually pay CAMT should analyze, in the period that includes the enactment date, whether to assess the realizability of its deferred tax assets on the basis of all available information or, alternatively, only assess the realizability of its deferred tax assets on the basis of the regular tax system.

Analyzing whether a corporation will be a perpetual CAMT taxpayer requires careful consideration and may have an impact on financial statement presentation and tax planning.

As the tax environment continues to evolve, staying informed and proactive is key. Recently released Notices 2025-46 and 2025-49 from the Treasury and the IRS represent significant steps in the ongoing evolution of the CAMT. Consult with your tax adviser, model your options, and monitor for additional guidance to navigate CAMT and OBBBA with confidence. The story of CAMT is still unfolding, and those who stay ahead of the curve may be positioned to manage risk and identify potential opportunities.

The Alliance will serve as a coordinating hub for governors and their public-health officials and a unified, cross-state liaison with the global health community. Participating states will share best practices, facilitate data exchange, and collaborate on emergency response, public-health guidance, and technical issues such as vaccine policy.

“Every American deserves access to health care and this alliance will strengthen public health for everyone. Colorado is proud to be a leader in healthy living, and with this new opportunity to work together, we can share our best practices and innovative approach to public health, while learning from our colleagues around the country. With regular uncertainty and less resources from Washington D.C., Governors are on the front lines of public health. This new partnership will help states deliver consistent, commonsense solutions that prevent the spread of disease, save lives, and protect our freedom,” said Colorado Governor Jared Polis.

“As a cancer survivor and lifelong advocate for patients and caregivers, I’ve seen firsthand how critical strong public health systems are to saving lives and supporting families,” said Lieutenant Governor and Director of the Office of Saving People Money on Health Care, Dianne Primavera. “In Colorado, we’ve shown that when states lead with innovation and compassion, we can make healthcare more affordable, more connected, and more accessible for everyone. This alliance reflects that same spirit — a shared commitment to building healthier, more resilient communities across the country.”

Colorado joins fourteen other states and territories in launching the Alliance, including: California, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawai‘i, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island, Washington, and Guam. Within Colorado, the Governor’s Office and the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment (CDPHE) will coordinate engagement and share lessons from Colorado’s nationally recognized efforts to lower health costs, improve behavioral-health access, and expand preventive-care initiatives.

The Governors Public Health Alliance is a nonpartisan initiative supported by GovAct that helps governors coordinate and share expertise across states. The Alliance is guided by leading public-health experts, including Dr. Mandy Cohen, Dr. Anne Zink, Dr. Raj Panjabi, and Ambassador Nina Hachigian, along with GovAct’s bipartisan advisory board of former governors and senior federal officials. By collaborating through the Alliance, Colorado and partner states will coordinate messaging on emerging health threats, explore secure cross-border data sharing with trusted partners, and work jointly on technical and regulatory public health issues such as vaccine policy.

Colorado’s participation builds on years of work to make healthcare more affordable, equitable, and prepared for the future. Under the Polis–Primavera Administration:",https://www.colorado.gov/governor/themes/custom/polis/favicon.ico,N,,2025-10-15 11:03:53.305481

We have been tracking the administration’s actions since February, and our Executive Action Tracker (jointly maintained by the Center for Progressive Reform and Governing for Impact) highlights the speed and effectiveness with which the administration has advanced Project 2025’s goals.

According to our latest analysis, the Trump administration managed to initiate or fulfill more than 47 percent of the Project 2025 domestic regulatory agenda before the current government shutdown. This represents a substantial increase in the administration’s progress since April, when we found that 28 percent of the agenda had been completed.

In all, 251 of the 532 recommended actions identified in the tracker have been fully or partially completed, with the vast majority of them being actions that directly match the letter of Project 2025. The image below shows these numbers, depicting actions that have been initiated or completed (both direct and indirect) and pending actions.

To get a better sense of how these actions are distributed, we grouped them by agency (the 20 agencies within the executive branch explicitly called out in Project 2025) and divided them into direct, indirect, and pending. Direct actions are those that were initiated or completed by the agency listed as the responsible in Project 2025, and indirect actions are those that achieve the same policy goal but that were implemented by other agencies or Congress.

A clear example of an indirect action is the rollback of Resource Management Plans, crafted by the Bureau of Land Management, which is being achieved using Congressional Review Act resolutions. Despite not being rescinded by BLM, like Project 2025 asked for, the ultimate goal is still being fulfilled.

Similarly, Project 2025 called for restoring the Department of Transportation’s primacy on setting auto fuel efficiency, which is technically being pursued by having the Environmental Protection Agency abandon greenhouse emission standards altogether. This case also shows that, in some cases, the administration has gone beyond even Project 2025’s already extreme recommendations.

Moreover, it’s clear that many of the Trump administration’s signature actions arguably fit the spirit of Project 2025 — centralizing power within the White House or weakening civil rights for marginalized populations — though they were not explicitly called for in the plan. The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) seizure of agency information systems and the attacks on universities would fall into this category, for example.

The Detroit News

(TNS)

General Motors Co. on Tuesday reported that it sunk roughly $1.6 billion into electric vehicle manufacturing capacity that it no longer is using because of shifting federal auto policies under President Donald Trump.

GM reported the loss to the Securities and Exchange Commission as what’s known as an impairment charge. Impairment charges reflect assets that are not expected to bring in profits as initially expected.

GM “made significant investments and contractual commitments in the development of electric vehicles (EVs) to help the Company’s vehicle fleet comply with emissions and fuel economy regulations that were scheduled to become increasingly stringent,” according to a company filing.

“Following recent U.S. Government policy changes, including the termination of certain consumer tax incentives for EV purchases and the reduction in the stringency of emissions regulations, we expect the adoption rate of EVs to slow,” according to GM’s filing. “These developments have caused us to reassess our EV capacity and manufacturing footprint.”

GM executives have continued to call electrification the company’s “North Star.” But, along with other EV makers, the company has been shaken this year by Republicans’ removal of a $7,500 tax credit for EV buyers and lessees, as well as Trump’s efforts to pull back federal rules limiting vehicle greenhouse gas emissions.

GM more than doubled its electric vehicle sales in the third quarter compared with the same period a year ago, largely due to drivers hoping to take advantage of the tax credits before they expired Sept. 30. Analysts predict a steep drop-off in EV sales in the coming months.

Interest in EVs among U.S. drivers, while increasing, is also doing so at a far slower pace than many in the industry expected.

The bulk of GM’s impairment charge—$1.2 billion—represents machinery and other equipment to make EVs that is now sitting unused. The other $400 million is mostly from canceled contracts with suppliers to provide GM with more parts, materials and equipment than it now can use.

The life sciences and healthcare sector is an inherently collaborative and creative industry, and those traits remain crucial to countering the difficult funding market that continues through 2025. Uncertainty over tariffs, interest rates, prescription drug pricing and geopolitical conflicts is injecting volatility into valuations and access to capital. These macro variables continue to influence deal timing, structure and pricing, and they have extended diligence cycles. Yet the message from the conference was not one of retrenchment. Fundraising is occurring, innovation remains vibrant, and well-matched partners are finding ways to transact. Investors were encouraged to be bolder about exchanging ideas, form syndicates around promising platforms and bring conviction to earlier stage opportunities. For smaller biotechs, cultivating relationships with large pharma and embedding strategic partnerships into the financing plan were recurring themes.

Partnerships as capital efficiency

In a capital constrained environment, partnership is not merely optional—it is a capital efficiency strategy. Companies are using divestitures to sharpen focus, co developing to share cost and risk, and licensing by indication or territory to advance assets while conserving resources and leveraging external expertise. These structures enable companies to keep programs moving without overextending balance sheets, while buyers gain optionality through phased economics and rights tailored to their strategic needs.

The supply demand imbalance for de risked assets

There is more demand for de risked assets than supply. Buyers seeking either proven, non novel products or innovative assets with established data often confront competitive processes and premium pricing. As a result, many are looking earlier in the development continuum. Later stage deals face added friction from supply chain uncertainty and higher manufacturing costs, while earlier stage transactions shift more R&D investment to the buyer and therefore tend to feature lower upfront valuations, tranched funding, and milestone heavy economics. This is pushing dealmakers to craft structures that balance risk sharing with sufficient incentives to keep programs on track.

The patent cliff as a catalyst for M&A

Throughout the conference, speakers highlighted the looming patent cliff that will affect a significant number of high revenue products over the next five years. Large pharma executives noted that planning for loss of exclusivity is a constant feature of portfolio management, but the magnitude of expirations ahead raises the stakes. The consensus was clear: internal R&D alone cannot close the gap. Expect a steady pickup in M&A and late stage partnering as companies look to fill anticipated revenue holes, diversify therapeutic exposure and secure platform technologies that can generate multiple shots on goal.

AI: acceleration and disruption

Artificial intelligence is accelerating drug discovery, trial design and data analysis, while simultaneously reshaping capital flows. Where capital is available, AI centric companies are capturing a meaningful share, heightening competition for funding across the broader life sciences ecosystem. Diagnostics companies are among those deploying AI in particularly promising ways, but the quality of outputs depends on the quality of inputs. Historical limitations in data collection—such as the underrepresentation of women in certain clinical trials—can propagate bias into models. A pragmatic approach discussed at the conference was to partner with “tech tech”: let technology firms focus on building and refining models, while pharma and biotech provide the proprietary domain data and governance required to train those models responsibly and effectively. This division of labor can accelerate timelines while mitigating risk.

What this means for M&A in 2025

Taken together, these dynamics point to an M&A market that is selective but active. Strategic acquirers are sharpening their theses around core therapeutic areas and platform capabilities. Boards are insisting on disciplined capital allocation, which favors structured deals, earn outs and option based collaborations. Sellers who can articulate clear value inflection points, present clean data packages and offer rights that align with buyer strategy are best positioned. Meanwhile, the patent cliff and the maturation of AI enabled discovery are likely to sustain deal flow as buyers seek both near term revenue and long term growth engines.",https://edge.sitecorecloud.io/allenoveryllp1-aoshearmanwe0db-production-ecf3/media/project/aoshearman/aoshearman/blogs/images/on-life-sciences/digital-dna-gettyimages684137700.jpg?h=1063&iar=0&w=1600,N,,2025-10-15 12:12:16.968948

The Global Carbon Fiber Market size is expected to be worth around USD 9.2 Billion by 2034, from USD 4.4 Billion in 2024, growing at a CAGR of 7.7% during the forecast period from 2025 to 2034.

Carbon fiber (CF) is a high-performance material made from precursor fibers (most commonly polyacrylonitrile, or PAN) which are converted by stabilization, carbonization, and graphitization processes. It offers exceptional strength-to-weight ratio, stiffness, corrosion resistance, and thermal stability. These attributes make carbon fiber a preferred material in demanding applications such as aerospace, wind turbine blades, high-end automotive, pressure vessels, sports equipment, and advanced infrastructure components.

The growth of this industry is underpinned by several strong driving factors. First, the global push toward decarbonization and energy transition stimulates demand in clean-energy infrastructure—especially wind and hydrogen sectors—where carbon fiber’s lightweight, high-strength traits enable longer blades and lighter pressure vessels. For example, in hydrogen storage applications, carbon fiber currently accounts for about 50% of the cost of the storage tank system; research efforts are targeting carbon fiber production costs below USD 15/kg to accelerate adoption.

From a policy and government initiative vantage, several jurisdictions are encouraging carbon fiber deployment or manufacturing. In the United States, agencies such as the DOE have explored policy instruments to support carbon fiber manufacturing via R&D funding, economic development incentives, and clustering strategies.

For instance, the DOE’s Bioenergy Technologies Office announced a USD 12 million funding opportunity to develop renewable carbon fiber from biomass feedstocks. Government incentive frameworks frequently include tax credits, grants, or infrastructure support to promote advanced materials manufacturing, especially when aligned with clean energy goals. In the trade domain, recent U.S. tariff adjustments increased duties on imported carbon fiber tow to 25% effective March 2025, which may encourage domestic production substitution.

Emerging Trends

Rise of Circular & Recyclable Carbon Fiber Composites

Carbon fiber composites today often result in significant scrap or waste during manufacturing: up to 40 % of carbon fiber (or CFRP) material is reportedly sent to landfill during fabrication or trimming steps. That’s not trivial — imagine almost half of the “super material” ending up unused or tossed. To counter this, researchers and manufacturers are pushing for “zero-waste” manufacturing methods or ways to reclaim fibers effectively.

Particularly promising is the work from the U.S. National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). Their team has developed carbon fiber composites made with bio-derivable resin (a greener kind of polymer) that can be recycled at least three times using a mild depolymerization process. This means a part made of carbon fiber composite might live through three life cycles instead of ending in waste after one use. If scaled and commercialized, this would drastically lower the effective cost and environmental burden of carbon fiber parts.

Another indicator of the trend’s strength is the technological maturity of recycling research. A study tracking research output and development maturity estimated that in 2018, the maturity of carbon fiber composite recycling was around 10%, but projections expect it to hit 50% by 2028, and almost 90% by 2038.

Governments and research bodies are paying attention too. Many countries now include “recyclable materials” or “circular economy” as part of their roadmap or industrial policy. For instance, clean manufacturing and extended producer responsibility (EPR) policies often require producers to think of end-of-life management. Though I didn’t find a carbon-fiber-specific national policy in this latest scan, these broader policies push composite manufacturers to adopt recyclable strategies.

Drivers

Light-weighting to Improve Energy Efficiency in Transportation

One of the most powerful forces steering the growth of carbon fiber is the urgent need to make vehicles lighter so they consume less fuel or electricity. In simple terms: lighter vehicles mean less energy used. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, cutting vehicle weight by just 10% can boost fuel efficiency by 6–8 %. That relationship makes carbon fiber — which offers very high strength for low weight — highly attractive for automakers who must meet tighter emissions and efficiency rules.

In many countries, governments are pushing for stricter standards on fuel economy and carbon emissions. For example, regulatory bodies may require auto manufacturers to reduce fleet average emissions in grams of CO₂ per kilometer. That puts pressure on car companies to look for advanced materials. Replace parts made of steel or aluminum with carbon fiber composites, and you can shave off handfuls of kilos across the body, chassis, or internal components — and those kilos saved translate into real energy and emissions benefits over millions of vehicles.

Governments are also actively supporting research and policies to make lightweight materials more affordable and to encourage their adoption. In the U.S., for instance, Department of Energy (DOE) programs aim to develop lower-cost carbon fiber processes so that this “super material” becomes viable for more regular cars (not just premium models). Public funding, tax incentives, or matching grants for manufacturing modernization are typical levers used in many countries (though the details differ). This kind of support helps offset the high cost of carbon fiber production and encourages industry to scale innovations.

Restraints

High Energy & Environmental Cost of Production

One of the biggest brakes slowing down carbon fiber’s wider adoption is how energy-hungry and carbon-intensive its production can be. That’s more than a technical issue — it touches economics, environment, and public perception.

To start with, producing carbon fiber demands vast amounts of energy. Studies show that making 1 kg of carbon fiber typically consumes between 50 and 80 kWh of energy in conventional routes. In more intensive cases or less optimized processes, the energy use can vary even more widely — from 2.1 to 132.8 kWh per kg in some literature estimates. On the climate side, this high energy use translates into heavy greenhouse gas emissions: many evaluations put the carbon footprint of virgin carbon fiber production in the range of 13 to 34 kg CO₂ per kg of fiber.

This energy and emissions burden is not just a “nice to avoid” — it becomes a competitive liability. In applications that are very sensitive to life-cycle emissions, or where consumers or regulators demand low-carbon materials (for instance, in transportation or green infrastructure), carbon fiber’s footprint can work against it. The higher emissions profile becomes a cost in regulatory compliance, carbon taxes, or environmental disclosures.

Another angle where this restraint bites hard is cost structure. In a detailed cost model for a reasonably large production plant, producing 1 kg of carbon fiber was estimated to cost USD 10.87, where the precursor material alone accounted for ~53.4% of that cost, and energy contributed ~7%. This means that any fluctuation in energy prices or stricter carbon pricing policies can rapidly make carbon fiber less competitive compared to lighter metals or advanced aluminum alloys. Indeed, for new world-scale plants targeting a 10% internal rate of return, industry analysts forecast that costs per kg might need to be around USD 25 under certain energy-intensive assumptions.

Carbon fiber producers often face tension: to lower their carbon footprint or energy demand, they must invest in advanced equipment, cleaner energy sources, or process innovations — all of which require capital and time. For example, the U.S. Department of Energy’s manufacturing programs aim to drive down energy use in carbon fiber production by up to 75% over a decade, relative to baseline processes.

Opportunity

Expansion in Wind Turbine Blades and Renewable Energy

One of the most promising growth opportunities for carbon fiber lies in its application in wind turbine blades, especially as nations push to scale up renewable energy. Wind power is a central part of many countries’ clean energy targets, and carbon fiber offers a way to build longer, lighter, stronger blades — enabling turbines to generate more electricity with each rotation.

In the U.S., the wind energy supply chain report highlights that fiber-reinforced composites — including carbon fiber — compose primary materials used in blades. The report also mentions that demand for carbon fiber for wind turbines could triple by around 2027. This “tripling” is not just hype — it reflects how wind project developers are eyeing carbon fiber to leap past limitations of existing blade technology. As turbines go offshore into harsher environments, the durability, fatigue resistance, and lightweight nature of carbon fiber become more compelling.

Governments increasingly support this shift. Renewable energy mandates, feed-in tariffs, auctions, and subsidies for wind development help drive demand for higher-performance blade materials. Many countries include local content requirements, R&D funding, or tax benefits for innovation in wind tech. For instance, national wind energy agencies often partner with composite material labs or institutes to support novel blade designs that incorporate carbon fiber. These policies de-risk investment in new materials, making carbon fiber more attractive to wind OEMs and blade manufacturers.

Beyond wind, the growth opportunity extends to hybrid energy systems. As more grids integrate solar, storage, and offshore wind, developers demand materials that can handle cyclic loads, corrosion, and material fatigue over decades. Carbon fiber is positioned well in that niche. The global push toward renewable energy is not slowing.

According to the IEA’s Global Energy Review 2025, global energy demand grew 2.2% in 2024, with electricity demand rising 4.3 % — and renewables contributed 38% of that growth in energy supply. This trend means more investments in wind and solar assets — meaning more demand for advanced materials like carbon fiber.

Regional Insights

Europe dominates with 34.70% share amounting to USD 1.5 Billion as regional carbon fiber leader

In 2024, the European carbon fiber market stood at approximately USD 1.5 billion, corresponding to around 34.70% of the global market. This dominant position is rooted in the strong presence of key industries in Europe—automotive, aerospace, renewable energy (notably wind turbines), and high-performance sports equipment—that demand high-quality carbon fiber for lightweighting and performance.

Year 2024 in Europe saw demand rising particularly in automotive sectors where OEMs increase carbon fiber usage for body structures, frames, and internal parts to reduce vehicle weight and meet stricter emission regulations. Similarly, the wind energy sector placed large orders for carbon fiber used in turbine blades as offshore and onshore wind projects proliferated in Northern Europe. Aerospace further contributed significantly, with European aircraft manufacturers (e.g. Airbus) incorporating carbon fiber in fuselage and wing components.

Attendees agreed Italy needs to invest in batteries and the grid as well as renewable energy generation.
He stressed the importance, however, of future-proofing any new Italian energy system, adding, “Italy must build a system that is also redundant, with respect to what the needs are.
“FER X, which is very well designed, stabilizes investment,” said Merli.
Experts then said that, for next year, we should expect two MACSE auctions, one for lithium batteries and one for pumped storage, and at least one Capacity Market auction.","Attendees at the Italian Renewables Investment Forum 2025, held in Rome by Green Horse, predicted the nation will hold two Mercato a termine degli stoccaggi (MACSE) auctions next year: A second lithium-ion battery exercise and another dedicated to pumped hydro. At least one more capacity market auction was also predicted for 2026.

Stefano Granella, CEO of Dolomiti Energia Group, stressed the key role planning will have in the nation’s energy transition and said the MACSE program was a good start, but more is needed. “Batteries are needed, what happened recently is excellent but it is not the panacea,” said Granella.

The chief executive said the low margins of both the MACSE and Fonti Energetiche Rinnovabili (FER) X programs suggest they are tools that make investment feasible but only for companies which can develop projects and processes on an industrial scale.

Attendees at yesterday’s event agreed Italy’s energy prices make the country a more attractive location for investment than Spain, which has ultra-low energy prices; the United States, thanks to political headwinds; and South America, where curtailment of renewable energy occurs in some countries and others entail currency risk. Italy’s attractiveness has been boosted by subsidy policy, according to Green Horse Legal Managing Partner Carlo Montella, who said, “What makes Italy particularly attractive are the regulated remuneration schemes.”

Granella, however, warned the tariffs determined by the MACSE and FER X programs suggest Italy’s energy transition could follow a similar path to Spain’s.

Attendees agreed Italy needs to invest in batteries and the grid as well as renewable energy generation.

Luca Marchisio, head of system strategy at Terna, said Italy will have 200 GW of installed generation capacity by 2030, including 140 GW of clean power facilities. With the nation having had a peak load to date of 60 GW, Marchisio said, “Curtailment will be a structural element of the operation of our system, period.”

Marco Carta, CEO of Agici, said investing in renewables costs money but doing nothing costs much more.

“The overall loss for the national economy would amount to €137 billion ($159 billion) by 2050, equal to over €5 billion a year,” said Carta. “The cost of … doing [would be] €6,000 euros per inhabitant. This is constantly declined at the regional level.”

Carta presented a report indicating renewables investment benefits stand at around €160 billion and not investing in clean energy would mean 342,000 fewer jobs.

CVA Chief Executive Giuseppe Argirò noted a “very fractured and dangerous” geopolitical environment and said the Russian gas shock may prove to be the first of many. He stressed the importance, however, of future-proofing any new Italian energy system, adding, “Italy must build a system that is also redundant, with respect to what the needs are. I am convinced that, in a very few years technology will bring very significant performance at even lower prices. We must aim for a system that is safe, therefore reducing dependency.”

ERG chief executive Paolo Merli highlighted the poor performance of renewables stocks since peaking in January 2021 and said Italian support mechanisms were not doing enough.

“FER X, which is very well designed, stabilizes investment,” said Merli. “But that same FER X plant contributes to bringing plant prices to zero.”

Several attendees spoke about the Iberdrola model and the message from the event was that we are entering a phase in which competition will be significant in auctions.

Experts then said that, for next year, we should expect two MACSE auctions, one for lithium batteries and one for pumped storage, and at least one Capacity Market auction.",https://www.ess-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/green-horse-a.jpg,N,,2025-10-15 11:03:12.715944

The plan will increase the automaker’s annual finished vehicle output by roughly 50 percent, building on what executives described as Stellantis’ “already significant” American footprint. The investment includes research and development funding, supplier partnerships, and major upgrades at facilities in Illinois, Ohio, Michigan and Indiana.

“This investment in the U.S. — the single largest in the company’s history — will drive our growth, strengthen our manufacturing footprint and bring more American jobs to the states we call home,” said Antonio Filosa, the company’s chief executive and North America chief operating officer, in a statement. “As we begin our next 100 years, we are putting the customer at the center of our strategy, expanding our vehicle offerings and giving them the freedom to choose the products they want and love.”

Filosa added that accelerating U.S. growth has been a priority since his first day in the role. “Success in America is not just good for Stellantis in the U.S. — it makes us stronger everywhere,” he said.

The automaker said the $13 billion plan will underpin its full product strategy through 2029, including 19 refreshed models across U.S. plants and new or updated powertrains.

In Illinois, Stellantis plans to invest more than $600 million to reopen the Belvidere Assembly Plant, which will produce Jeep Cherokee and Jeep Compass models for the American market beginning in 2027. The reopening is expected to create about 3,300 jobs.

In Ohio, roughly $400 million will be directed toward the Toledo Assembly Complex, which will take over production of a new midsize truck initially slated for Belvidere. The shift could generate more than 900 new positions, with production starting in 2028. Stellantis also reaffirmed previous investments in its Toledo operations, including enhancements for the Jeep Wrangler and Gladiator lines and additional machining components.

In Michigan, the Warren Truck Assembly Plant will undergo a nearly $100 million retooling to produce a new range-extended electric and internal combustion large SUV beginning in 2028, adding more than 900 jobs. Another $130 million will prepare the Detroit Assembly Complex–Jefferson for the next-generation Dodge Durango, with production expected to start in 2029.

Our Next Energy, founded in 2020 by Mujeeb Ijaz, a former A123 Systems employee, promised to bring a $1.6 billion investment and 2,112 new jobs to Van Buren Township. But just two years after receiving state support, the company has laid off most of its staff and is leaving its facility without creating 2,000 jobs.

MSF ACT FY 2023-24 by mcclallen

Our Next Energy has fired most of its employees and is giving up the lease on its Van Buren Township facility, Automotive News reported in September. ONE did not respond to an email seeking comment. The company has locations in Novi and Belleville.

Gov. Gretchen Whitmer had applauded a state grant to the company in 2022.

“Our Next Energy’s $1.6 billion investment creating 2,112 jobs in Van Buren Township will build on our economic momentum and secure the future of mobility and electrification right here in Michigan,” Whitmer said in a press release. “This innovative, Michigan-made company is on the cutting-edge of battery technology, and the work they’re doing will increase the range of electric vehicles to over 600 miles on a single charge. With this new gigafactory, we will continue bringing the supply chain of electric vehicles, chips, and batteries home to Michigan and the USA while creating a sustainable, clean energy economy. I am proud that Democrats and Republicans in Michigan came together to build up our economic development toolkit and empowered our state to compete for every project and every job. We will work with anyone and compete with everyone to keep putting Michiganders first, creating good-paying jobs with great benefits, and building the future of the auto industry right here in Michigan.”

A Mackinac Center for Public Policy report has found that over 20 years, jobs subsidies failed 91% of the time.

“One company failing to live up to promises is not an aberration, it should be an expectation for lawmakers,” James Hohman, the Mackinac Center’s fiscal policy director, told CapCon in an email. “Major deals fail to create 91% of the jobs lawmakers say will be created. The company has collected $70 million from taxpayers already. State officials should stop making deals where companies get cash prior to hitting their job targets.”

The Michigan Economic Development Corporation continues to review its incentive agreement with Our Next Energy, Danielle Emerson, MEDC public relations manager, told CapCon in an email.

“While the jobs requirement milestone for this project is not due until December 2029, we are being proactive in working with ONE to ensure the agreement reflects any updated scope of the project,” Emerson wrote. “In the meantime, no new disbursements will be made under the current agreement. We are optimistic about the company’s path forward given the potential benefit from the federal One Big Beautiful Bill tying tax credits to domestic content. To date, $70.2 million has been disbursed to the company to reimburse for $117.6 million in eligible costs invested by the company.

1. Rise of renewables

Renewable energy has produced more electricity than coal for the first time, according to a report from energy think tank Ember.

Global electricity demand grew by 2.6% in the first half of 2025 – a rise that was more than met by increases in solar (+31%) and wind generation (+7.7%), the report says. With growth of 306 TWh – about the same amount of electricity that a country like Italy uses in a year – solar alone covered 83% of the increase in demand.

Coal generation, meanwhile, fell by 0.6%, leading to renewables’ share of global electricity rising 1.6 percentage points to 34.3%. Coal’s share fell by just over a percentage point to 33.1%.

Coal use and emissions fell in China and India as wind and solar met the growth in demand, the report adds. But its use grew in other major regions, with the European Union leaning on gas and coal to offset falls in hydro, bioenergy and wind generation and the US using more coal because clean sources did not rise enough to meet demand growth.

Concluding that the surge of solar and wind provides a “pivotal moment” to accelerate the energy transition, the report calls for governments to set ambitious targets and policies to speed up deployment of clean energy sources.

Emerging economies in particular, it says, still face barriers to renewables generation and need support from mature economies to overcome them.

The World Economic Forum's Coal to Clean platform works with energy, finance and civil society organizations to accelerate funding for the early retirement and repurposing of coal-fired power plants in emerging economies

2. Invest in grids and batteries - IEA

Amid the surge in solar, the head of the International Energy Agency (IEA) has highlighted the need to address supply chain and grid challenges.

In an announcement accompanying the agency’s Renewables 2025 report, Fatih Birol said that, driven by low costs and faster timeframes for permits, solar PV is on course to account for about 80% of the increase in the world’s renewable capacity until the end of this decade.

As renewables’ role in power systems increases in many countries, policy-makers “need to pay close attention to supply chain security and grid integration challenges,” he said.

The rapid rise of renewables is putting increasing pressure on electricity systems, the report notes, and with curtailment and negative price events appearing in more markets, it calls for urgent investment in grids, energy storage and flexible generation.

The report lowers its overall renewable energy growth forecast for 2025-2030 by 5% compared to last year to reflect policy, regulatory and market changes.

The report underscores the need to ensure power systems are flexible, resilient and sustainable – these will be the ""backbone of future economies"", according to the World Economic Forum's Future of Power Systems initiative.

The initiative works with a diverse range of stakeholders to drive the partnerships, strategies and innovations that will support future demand.

3. News in brief: More energy stories from around the world

FREMONT, Calif. and AUSTIN, Texas, Oct. 15, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Nextracker (NASDAQ: NXT), a leading solar technology platform provider, and T1 Energy Inc. (NYSE: TE), an advanced manufacturer of solar modules, today announced a strategic framework agreement to use Nextracker’s patented steel module frame technology for T1 Energy’s new 5-GW G1_Dallas solar manufacturing facility. The agreement is expected to accelerate the industry’s transition away from imported aluminum frames toward made-in-the-USA frames using locally manufactured specialty steel, and support demand in the U.S. for durable solar technology.

“Clearway applauds Nextracker’s technology and manufacturing program to bring next-generation, American-made steel module frames to support the domestic photovoltaics (PV) industry. These new steel frames increase the domestic content of the module, create a stiffer, more reliable module, and with Nextracker's ongoing innovation, will enable faster installation rates compared to legacy aluminum frames,” said Ross Heiman, vice president of engineering at Clearway Energy Group.

“We’re proud to offer our customers leading-edge solar module frame technology from Nextracker,” said Daniel Barcelo, Chairman and CEO, T1 Energy. “These are American companies and factories with American workers delivering American energy security. With potential for surging demand from data centers and AI infrastructure, the U.S. needs to establish critical energy supply chains built on domestic capacity and industrial expertise. This is exactly what T1 and Nextracker are doing, together.”

“Solar panels were invented by Bell Labs in the 1950s, and it is fantastic to see reshoring of PV manufacturing facilities at real scale in the USA,” said Dan Shugar, founder and CEO of Nextracker. “It is a privilege to be supporting T1 Energy’s state-of-the-art manufacturing facility in Dallas with our patented steel module frames using high quality and low carbon U.S.-produced steel. Our technology enables lower cost solar power by improving PV module durability and installation velocity.”

Most solar frames are produced with extruded aluminum and imported from Asia. Through this partnership, Nextracker will reshore critical manufacturing capacity and enable a domestic supply of specialty steel frames that are competitively priced and are expected to be more durable, and less exposed to tariff and global supply chain risks.

To support this initiative, Nextracker plans to increase its existing U.S. steel frame capacity in the Midwest with additional manufacturing lines in Texas, creating high-quality jobs. This would complement Nextracker’s Texas footprint of more than a dozen manufacturing partners that produce key solar tracker components.

The decision, reached Friday, found that the Louisiana Department of Conservation and Energy (formerly Energy and Natural Resources) failed to consider the environmental impacts on surrounding communities when it approved a permit for the Commonwealth LNG export facility.
The halted Commonwealth facility is one of six LNG export projects proposed, approved or operating along Cameron’s coast.
The state permit for Commonwealth LNG will be suspended until the Office of Coastal Management considers climate change and environmental justice concerns in its evaluation, according to Judge Richard’s ruling.
The state would need to consider these additional aspects and find that impacts on the community do not outweigh the benefits of constructing another LNG export facility along Cameron’s coast in order to reissue the permit, the judge wrote in her opinion.","A Cameron Parish judge has ruled that state officials violated the Louisiana Constitution when they issued a permit for a liquified gas export terminal, which has halted construction on the facility.

The halted Commonwealth facility is one of six LNG export projects proposed, approved or operating along Cameron’s coast. Construction of the pipelines, storage tanks and shipping facilities that make up the facility would dig up or fill nearly 200 acres of wetlands and water bottoms, according to the project’s coastal use permit application.

Judge Penelope Richard cited the close vicinity of other export terminals as a factor in her decision, saying the state “failed to consider the secondary and cumulative impacts” of these facilities on climate change in the coastal zone.

“We hope this ruling shakes Louisiana to its senses,” said Anne Rolfes, director of Louisiana Bucket Brigade. “The coastal use permit needs to be revoked.”

Rolfes’s organization, the Sierra Club and the Turtle Island Restoration Network filed the suit in August 2024.

“This is an area of the Louisiana coastline that is being devastated by LNG facilities,” said Joanie Steinhaus, ocean program director for Turtle Island Restoration Network. “These agencies have long ignored the cumulative impact to air and water quality and the health of the local community members and the environment”

There was no immediate response to attempts Tuesday to reach Commonwealth LNG about the court ruling.

Another lawsuit in a U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit rejected the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s approval of the project, citing its pollution impact. The decision delayed construction for two months until a new permit reevaluated the full impact of air pollution harms.

This move signals a full-throttle return to growth for Stellantis in what is one of its most critical markets globally.
Success in America is not just good for Stellantis in the U.S., it makes us stronger everywhere,” – Antonio Filosa, CEO and North America COO, Stellantis.
The $400 million investment and 900 added jobs show a clear intent to compete directly with segment leaders like the popular Toyota Tacoma and Ford Ranger.
Meanwhile, Detroit’s Jefferson complex will be readied for the next-generation Dodge Durango in 2029 with an additional $130 million investment.","Following the controversial exit of Carlos Tavares in December last year, Stellantis appointed Jeep’s growth architect, Antonio Filosa, as its new CEO in May. Stellantis is one of the world’s leading Automotive conglomerates, formed in 2021 after the merger of FCA and PSA, with 14 brands under its umbrella.

He was tasked with steering the fourth-largest automaker in the world towards profitability following turbulent times for several key brands within the portfolio. His priority was to stabilize the North American business by moving some production back to the U.S., introducing competitive pricing strategies, and offering a fresh vehicle lineup across the brand’s core markets.

Filosa’s arrival was quickly followed by the return of another key figure in the Stellantis hierarchy, Tim Kuniskis. A key figure responsible for the success of the modern era of the Dodge brand, Kuniskis was brought back to lead the conglomerate’s North American comeback as Head of American Brands and North American Marketing and Retail Strategy, while also taking charge as CEO of the Truck brand. He now oversees Chrysler, Jeep, and Dodge, working to tighten marketing strategies and rebuild dealer confidence. A major announcement he made was the return of RAM Trucks to NASCAR.

Now, in what is the largest single investment in the company’s 100-year history, a $13 billion investment marks the first major step in that broader recovery plan. Stellantis will expand U.S. production by 50 percent and create more than 5,000 jobs across the states of Illinois, Ohio, Michigan, and Indiana. This move signals a full-throttle return to growth for Stellantis in what is one of its most critical markets globally.

“Accelerating growth in the U.S. has been a top priority since my first day. Success in America is not just good for Stellantis in the U.S., it makes us stronger everywhere,” – Antonio Filosa, CEO and North America COO, Stellantis.

In Illinois, Stellantis will reopen the Belvidere Assembly Plant to produce two new Jeep models, the mid-size Cherokee and compact Compass SUVs, backed by a $600 million infusion and around 3,300 new jobs. It’s a strategic move that brings production back to the Midwest, reaffirming Jeep’s American manufacturing roots. Over in Toledo, Ohio, Stellantis will assemble an all-new midsize truck previously destined for Belvidere alongside the Wrangler and Gladiator pickup. The $400 million investment and 900 added jobs show a clear intent to compete directly with segment leaders like the popular Toyota Tacoma and Ford Ranger.

The state of Michigan will see Warren Truck Assembly retooled to build a large SUV in both internal-combustion and range-extended EV forms in 2028, with nearly $100 million in upgrades and 900 new positions. Meanwhile, Detroit’s Jefferson complex will be readied for the next-generation Dodge Durango in 2029 with an additional $130 million investment.

Finally, Indiana’s Kokomo facilities will produce the new GMET4 EVO four-cylinder engine starting in 2026, supported by $100 million in funding and 100 new jobs. This new powertrain is part of Stellantis’ broader plan to balance performance and efficiency across its lineup. In total, Stellantis’ U.S. footprint now spans 34 facilities across 14 states, employing over 48,000 people, setting the stage for five new models, 19 product updates, and a projected 50 percent production jump by 2029. This strategic investment is the first major step on the path to recovery and better positions Stellantis to compete with the likes of Ford and GM, which together represent the Detroit Big Three.

GILBERT, Ariz., Oct. 14, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Legacy EV , a leader in electric vehicle education and conversion technology, has partnered with SmarterHelp, an independent workforce development company spun out from ChargerHelp!, to launch a joint training solution designed to prepare technicians for every part of the EV ecosystem — from the car to the charger.

The partnership aligns two industry leaders with a shared mission: to close the talent gap in clean transportation by offering scalable, hands-on training programs for schools, workforce boards, and technical organizations nationwide.

The bundled program begins with a shared introductory course, ""Intro to EV Jobs,"" which covers electrical theory, high-voltage safety, charging systems, and industry standards. From there, learners can choose one of two certification pathways:

EV Technician Pathway (Legacy EV): Focused on vehicle systems, diagnostics, and battery management.

EVSE Technician Pathway (SmarterHelp): Focused on charger commissioning, and maintenance.

""The EV revolution depends as much on people as it does on technology,"" said Mavrick Knoles, President of Legacy EV . ""This partnership gives learners a clear, industry-aligned path to meaningful careers in clean transportation — the kind of work that's shaping the future of mobility.""

""SmarterHelp's mission is to make green jobs accessible to everyone, especially in communities that have historically been left out of the clean-energy economy,"" said Kianna Scott, CEO of SmarterHelp . ""Together with Legacy EV, we're connecting the dots between vehicle and infrastructure training to build a workforce ready to keep the EV industry moving forward.""

According to the U.S. Department of Energy, more than 6 million clean-energy jobs will be created by 2035, with electric vehicles representing one of the fastest-growing segments. Yet only a fraction of today's workforce has the skills required to build and maintain these systems. By combining expertise in both vehicle electrification and charging infrastructure, Legacy EV and SmarterHelp are helping bridge that gap and accelerate workforce readiness for the clean-energy transition.

The new bundled training solution will be available to workforce boards, community colleges, and training organizations nationwide beginning in Q1 2026.

Perhaps most regrettably, Congress members no longer accept inquiries, suggestions, or criticism from persons residing out of state or out of district.

Perhaps most regrettably, Congress members no longer accept inquiries, suggestions, or criticism from persons residing out of state or out of district.","James Madison tried to warn us. He foresaw a grave danger to our fragile republic. No, it wasn’t an overreaching, dictatorial President. It was the people’s representatives themselves who might shred the untested constitutional fabric of the nascent United States.

Members of Congress could destroy it by neglecting the good of the country in favor of narrow, self-serving ends. Unity would collapse into endless internecine strife. Madison sounded this alarm in Federalist No. 10: he foresaw the inevitable emergence of “factions”—political parties “united and actuated by some common impulse of passion, or of interest, adverse to the rights of other citizens, or to the permanent and aggregate interests of the community.”

This invidious but inevitable human inclination could only be held in check if elected representatives could transcend their parochial outlook by interacting with delegates from other states and regions, with other points of view. By doing so, they would become broadly knowledgeable about vital national issues such as interstate commerce, taxes, and defense, and then enact laws that would benefit the country as a whole. If this expanding of the political horizon did not occur, Congress would either grind to a halt in hopeless deadlock or—worse—one party would exercise monopoly power over minorities.

The checks on congressional power embedded in the Constitution have so far prevented one of Madison’s fears from materializing: we see one such guardrail working—albeit messily—in the current impasse over federal expenditures. But a debilitating divisiveness has not been prevented. Today, Democrats and Republicans spend most of their time demonizing and blaming one another, stubbornly refusing to compromise. Most of the reasons for this are well understood—Citizens United, the loosening of restrictions on political contributions, the necessity of raising enormous amounts of money for campaigns, and the concomitant need to cater to well-to-do ideologues for contributions. But there is another, less apparent development that has dissuaded members of Congress from working together. This form of factionalism has infected Washington and isolated it. It has led lawmakers to think less and less about the People and focus more on the voters who elected them.

This represents a subtle but dramatic change from the ideal of national service. (The Constitution is vague about the duties and obligations of Congress, making this devolution possible.) It is evident, for example, in how Washington lawmakers see themselves differently. Whereas they once referred to their home states and districts as where they came from, they now affirm on their websites that this is whom they work for. If you visit the Capitol with a pass to your own representative or senator’s office, you won’t be welcomed in any others: they only serve their constituents. Perhaps most regrettably, Congress members no longer accept inquiries, suggestions, or criticism from persons residing out of state or out of district. (Campaign checks are welcomed, however.)

Half a century ago, you could write to Ted Kennedy, William Fulbright, Birch Bayh, and other Senate luminaries and not only would your letter be read, but you’d also receive a signed response addressing the issue you had raised. (I still treasure them, like papyrus scrolls.) In effect, your Congress is not the 435 members of the House and 50 members of the Senate: it has been reduced to just three lawmakers—two senators and a single House representative. In other words, your ability to potentially have influence on legislation has shrunk by over 99 percent. Constituents are fooling themselves if they think their representatives will personally read what they have written: the daily flood of emails and letters makes that impossible.

As their connections to the American people have been drastically reduced, members of Congress have increasingly focused on pleasing the people (voters) back home. Most of the tasks performed in their offices involve “casework”—fielding requests for tours and for flags flown over the Capitol, helping obtain government benefits, and providing guidance in applying for the service academies. Lawmakers also endear themselves by “bringing home the bacon”—obtaining federal funds for local organizations and projects, showing how they can “deliver.” But this assistance has nothing to do with passing laws. Even constituents can feel left out of that process as senators and representatives depend heavily on advice from lobbyists and contributions from special-interest groups and large donors to determine their votes. In this money-saturated climate, the “public interest” becomes difficult to discern, let alone honor. And it is no wonder that most ordinary Americans feel left out. Or that they become apathetic and disengage from politics.

But, for members of Congress, this new relationship has worked well. Making themselves popular by doing favors sets them apart from their colleagues in an increasingly unpopular branch of government. And serving constituent needs instead of the general good has been a winning strategy for legislators. In the 2024 election, for example, 96.6 percent of sitting representatives were returned to office. As one watchdog organization has sardonically put it, “Few things in life are more predictable than the chances of an incumbent member of the U.S. House of Representatives winning reelection.”

What, if anything, can be done to close this breach between lawmakers and the people? Given the makeup of the Supreme Court for the foreseeable future, there seems little likelihood of its overturning rulings allowing big money to have such an inordinate influence on elections. In order to change Congress’s ways, we will have to change the incentives that motivate its members’ behavior. Money is the most salient determinant. But how can “small” donors hope to have a greater impact than big ones? The answer would be: by collectively backing candidates from all parts of the country and from both parties who are committed to overcoming partisan gridlock and getting things done. Voters need to be proactive and empower themselves rather than passively let self-serving political organizations and wealthy contributors set the agenda and choose candidates for them. This goal could be accomplished through an online, interactive people’s forum dedicated to informing the public about candidates’ views, providing feedback to politicians, and donating to ones favoring legislative accomplishment over ideology. As such a forum expands, office seekers would become more broadly aware of public opinion and responsive to it. Money will still speak. But if it is going to continue to dominate electoral politics, isn’t it better to double down on this game than to throw in the towel and walk away?

John V. H. Dippel, an independent historian, has written several books on various topics in modern American and European history. In the late 1960s, he successfully petitioned several Senators to take up the cause of increasing First Amendment rights for members of the U.S. military. He welcomes the chance to lay out the case for doing so now through The Fulcrum.

Most of the tasks performed in their offices involve “casework”—fielding requests for tours and for flags flown over the Capitol, helping obtain government benefits, and providing guidance in applying for the service academies. Lawmakers also endear themselves by “bringing home the bacon”—obtaining federal funds for local organizations and projects, showing how they can “deliver.” But this assistance has nothing to do with passing laws. Even constituents can feel left out of that process as senators and representatives depend heavily on advice from lobbyists and contributions from special-interest groups and large donors to determine their votes. In this money-saturated climate, the “public interest” becomes difficult to discern, let alone honor. And it is no wonder that most ordinary Americans feel left out. Or that they become apathetic and disengage from politics.

But, for members of Congress, this new relationship has worked well. Making themselves popular by doing favors sets them apart from their colleagues in an increasingly unpopular branch of government. And serving constituent needs instead of the general good has been a winning strategy for legislators. In the 2024 election, for example, 96.6 percent of sitting representatives were returned to office. As one watchdog organization has sardonically put it, “Few things in life are more predictable than the chances of an incumbent member of the U.S. House of Representatives winning reelection.”

What, if anything, can be done to close this breach between lawmakers and the people? Given the makeup of the Supreme Court for the foreseeable future, there seems little likelihood of its overturning rulings allowing big money to have such an inordinate influence on elections. In order to change Congress’s ways, we will have to change the incentives that motivate its members’ behavior. Money is the most salient determinant. But how can “small” donors hope to have a greater impact than big ones? The answer would be: by collectively backing candidates from all parts of the country and from both parties who are committed to overcoming partisan gridlock and getting things done. Voters need to be proactive and empower themselves rather than passively let self-serving political organizations and wealthy contributors set the agenda and choose candidates for them. This goal could be accomplished through an online, interactive people’s forum dedicated to informing the public about candidates’ views, providing feedback to politicians, and donating to ones favoring legislative accomplishment over ideology. As such a forum expands, office seekers would become more broadly aware of public opinion and responsive to it. Money will still speak. But if it is going to continue to dominate electoral politics, isn’t it better to double down on this game than to throw in the towel and walk away?

""Their only avenue out of this is to get some kind of a waiver of liability, make the cases go away, bar the courthouse doors, get a 'get out of jail free card.'""

Dozens of cases modeled on successful actions against the tobacco industry in the 1990s are playing out in state courts nationwide -- including claims of injuries, failure to warn, and even racketeering, meaning acting like a criminal enterprise.

Some have been dismissed, and none have yet gone to trial -- though crucially, the conservative-dominated Supreme Court has repeatedly declined to intervene and block them.

- 'They have no shame' -

In June, 16 Republican state attorneys general urged the Trump administration to enact a shield law to end such cases.

""Under the banner of 'global climate change,' they have effectively declared an all-out war on traditional American energy,"" their letter said, calling the lawsuits ""lawfare against the energy industry.""

It faulted the Supreme Court for not moving the cases to federal court, where companies believe they stand a better chance of winning, and cited a 2005 statute granting gunmakers a similar liability shield.

""They have no shame,"" said Pat Parenteau, an emeritus professor of environmental law at the University of Vermont, pointing to the epidemic of gun violence. ""I mean, come on, that's your argument?""

Congress has yet to act, but observers see worrying signs it may be edging closer. A recent appropriations bill for the District of Columbia would bar the city from using funds to enforce consumer protection laws ""against oil and gas companies for environmental claims.""

And just last week, more than 100 House Republicans filed a friend-of-the-court brief in one Colorado case, urging the Supreme Court to ""put an end to these unconstitutional attempts to dictate national energy policy.""

AFP contacted Nebraska and West Virginia, which led the letter, as well as the Department of Justice, oil majors ExxonMobil, Shell, Chevron and BP, and the American Petroleum Institute. None responded.

- Coordinated campaign -

The Trump administration, for its part, has escalated attacks on Democrat-led states passing ""polluter pays"" laws -- suing for example New York and Vermont to block ""Superfunds"" that would require companies to pay billions toward climate and extreme weather resilience.

The Justice Department has also asked the Supreme Court to weigh in through a friend-of-the-court brief in the Colorado case, where the state's top court allowed Boulder County to proceed with its lawsuit against Suncor Energy.

A constellation of conservative legal scholars has joined what appears to be a coordinated push, including a FoxNews.com op-ed by John Yoo -- author of the Bush-era ""torture memos"" -- urging the Supreme Court to ""reaffirm federal authority over national energy.""

Results in the cases have so far have been mixed: oil firms have won dismissals in some states, while others have allowed cases to advance.

""There hasn't been a big verdict yet. It's not clear there's going to be a big verdict. And you've always got the Supreme Court lurking in the background,"" said Parenteau.

That may explain why Congress has hesitated to act, he added -- though ""given the craziness that's going on in America right now, anything's possible.""

Environmental groups have urged Democrats to hold firm, and this summer, the 3,000-member National Association of Counties passed a resolution opposing ""any legislation that would limit or preempt counties' access to courts or give companies immunity from lawsuits.""

Brigid Shea, commissioner for Texas' Travis County, who helped lead the resolution, told AFP local governments were being ""walloped"" by extreme weather. ""We have to protect our access to the courts,"" she said. ""This is fundamental to our democratic process.""

A professor of Earth and planetary sciences, Zaitchik's brow furrowed as he talked about the state of environmental health research in an era of extreme weather. In a nutshell: It's not good.

""In Baltimore, excessive rainwater pours into an aging infrastructure and underground water-flow channels that are, in many cases, unknown and complicated,"" he continued. ""The soil doesn't stay frozen as long in January, and it rains much more than it snows."" These conditions beget floods. And floods beget sewage backups and mold, which beget health problems, home-repair expenses, decreased property values, and stress.

But Baltimore faces additional challenges—many of them representative of those seen in dozens of other midsized industrial cities in the United States, Zaitchik said. Among the challenges: a stagnant population, rising temperatures and heat, and water and air pollution.

Remedies exist for these problems, and Zaitchik and his colleagues want to help devise solutions. They applied for and won a five-year, $25 million grant through the Department of Energy, one for which they teamed up with universities, utility companies, city agencies, and community organizations across the mid-Atlantic region to determine the best path forward. This past March, however, in the fourth year of their work, the federal government pulled back the funding.

Like hundreds of environmental scientists across the United States, Zaitchik received news from the DOE that his grant had been defunded—a brief phone call to say his work no longer aligned with the DOE's mission. The news didn't surprise him, considering the number of grants being canceled around him. ""But it enraged me [to see] the disrespect for our work, the loss of opportunity for our students, and, most importantly, the signal that these communities shouldn't have the science they need to thrive,"" Zaitchik said.

A troubling trend

Zaitchik's project is one of countless federally funded environmental health research projects across the country that have been terminated or scaled back over the past nine months. Federal actions have also reversed a number of climate-related policies and programs created to protect the public from environmental health hazards. According to Columbia University's Sabin Center for Climate Change Law, which tracks such efforts, this includes:

Putting out of commission (and no longer updating) several long-established data-gathering systems related to extreme weather, including the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's tracker of billion-dollar disasters

Issuing an executive order directing the attorney general to prevent states from enforcing policies that address extreme weather, environmental justice, pollution, and related topics

Rescinding policies that encourage the development of renewable energies like wind and solar

Exempting coal-fired power plants, chemical manufacturing plants, commercial sterilization facilities using ethylene oxide (a toxin linked to neurological and respiratory symptoms and cancer), and certain iron-ore processing sources from national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants for two years

The administration has also proposed canceling the finding that greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane harm human health—the so-called ""endangerment finding"" (2009) that enables the Environmental Protection Agency to regulate pollution from power plants, factories, oil and gas companies, cars, and other sources. If this finding were to be reversed—a move that requires approval from Congress—companies would be able to pollute as much as they want, without fear of fines and penalties. A move like this, scientists say, would increase the public's risk of heart and lung disease, as well as other ailments caused by pollutants.

""It's strange to be rushing head on into these hazards and say, 'Well, we're just going to close our eyes [to extreme weather] and not try to get ready. This will only hurt and cost more in the long run.""

Benjamin Zaitchik

Professor of Earth and planetary sciences, Johns Hopkins University

Moreover, these changes disproportionately affect people living in low-income areas, who are more likely to live near major roadways, ports, and factories, Zaitchik said.

The trickle-down effect puts the entire field of environmental science at stake, with a legion of scientists being forced to eliminate post-doctoral positions and reduce graduate student enrollment. Zaitchik said many grants have been canceled simply because they included words or language previously mandated by federal diversity requirements.

""Give me the chance, and I will write those words out of our project descriptions,"" he said. ""But allow us to train the next generation of scientists and continue work already underway.""

'A big unknown'

How extreme weather affects urban areas ""is currently a big unknown,"" said Zaitchik, principal investigator of the now-defunded DOE research project known as the Baltimore Social-Environmental Collaborative. Part of the DOE's Urban Integrated Field Lab, the overarching five-year project aimed to determine how extreme weather not just in Baltimore but also in Chicago; Beaumont-Port Arthur, Texas; and Phoenix affects each region's energy, water, and economics sectors. These cities already experience pressing challenges and ensuing costs and health risks from extreme weather, and multidisciplinary teams were put in place to gather data and use what they learn to protect each region's communities.

The teams span multiple institutions and organizations. In Baltimore, for instance, scientists and public health scholars from Johns Hopkins formed partnerships with teams from Morgan State University, Pennsylvania State University, Baltimore Gas and Electric, and the Baltimore City Office of Public Utilities—plus other agencies and community organizations. In other regions, partners ranged from Chicago State University, the University of Illinois–Urbana-Champaign, and Northwestern University to North Carolina A&T University, the University of Texas at Austin, Texas A&M University, Arizona State University, and the University of Arizona, along with an assortment of utility companies, city agencies, and community organizations.

For the projects in all four cities, the DOE defunded 75% of the grant's fourth year and 100% of its fifth year, essentially halting support for the work after investing in and putting in place the equipment, teams of people, and infrastructure to make it happen, Zaitchik said.

Darryn Waugh, professor of Earth and planetary sciences at Johns Hopkins, works on the project with Zaitchik. He ventured across Baltimore talking to community members and installing and maintaining weather-monitoring stations at churches, recreation centers, schools, and other public places. His goal: collect data on everything from temperature and humidity to wind, precipitation, and pollution—and use it to learn how extreme weather and air quality affect the region's health, economics, and energy supply. Previously, only one weather-monitoring station existed in Baltimore, at the Inner Harbor, and ""you cannot tell how heat and rainfall vary across the city from a single station,"" Waugh said.

Without data to paint a clear picture of what's happening, cities can't prepare for the powerful hurricanes and storms, extensive rainfall and droughts, wildfires, and other weather-related events that are already upon us, Waugh and Zaitchik said. They can't conduct financial analyses to determine the most cost-efficient remedies, and they can't predict the energy demands that are already shifting in what science confirms to be an era of extreme weather.

""Cities and states have budgets and can't fix everything,"" Zaitchik said. ""They have to prioritize, and that can't happen in the dark.""

Waugh also serves as principal investigator of a three-year, $1.5 million NASA grant to study air pollution in Baltimore neighborhoods with heavy traffic. These neighborhoods tend to be low-income areas where residents neither own cars nor contribute to the pollution—but nevertheless can suffer the health-related consequences, Waugh said.

Unlike the DOE grant, which was defunded but not completely terminated, ""we received a stop-work notice on the NASA grant because it involved an environmental justice angle to help communities of color and communities in need,"" he explained, referring to the federal government's executive order issued this past January to cease all environmental-justice-related work across the United States, regardless of the specifics.

""We spent years planning the steps, building the systems and teams, and doing the rigorous work it takes to apply for and receive funding, only to have support for our grants up and ended, with no explanation or discussion,"" Waugh said. ""I've worked at Hopkins for 27 years and never seen anything like this.""

A series of setbacks

Cancelled grants at Johns Hopkins also include a three-year Environmental Protection Agency award for work to identify the components of biosolids— essentially ""sewage sludge""—used to fertilize crops across the country.

""Biosolids are processed human sewage sludge, and they've been contentious forever because of the potential health risks,"" Keeve Nachman, a professor in environmental health and engineering in the university's Bloomberg School of Public Health, said. ""Many of the chemicals in biosolids are both unknown and unregulated, and there are concerns that people being exposed to those chemicals are possibly getting sick.""

Workers who transport biosolids from wastewater treatment plants and spread them on farms experience the most exposure, Nachman said. But given that biosolids are used to fertilize the food we eat, and the food animals eat, and given that runoff from farms can get into our drinking water, most people are exposed at some level, he explained. And the risks and consequences remain unknown.

Carsten Prasse, the grant's principal investigator and an associate professor of environmental health and engineering at JHU's Whiting School of Engineering, worked with Nachman and Sara Lupolt, an assistant scientist in environmental health and engineering, to interview employees of farms that use biosolids. Their biggest finding: Workers face a potentially high level of exposure to toxic chemicals through biosolids, but the EPA doesn't know how much—and hasn't factored workers into their risk assessments and safety guidelines on biosolids. This means, for instance, that farm workers use personal protective equipment inconsistently. And when the machines they use to spread biosolids get clogged with sewage sludge and break down (which happens routinely), they often resort to cleaning the equipment by hand—and risk direct exposure to harmful chemicals.

Prasse and his team, including post-doctoral fellows, doctoral candidates, and other students in his lab, conducted a simulated experiment that involved growing crops on a plot of land and applying biosolids as a fertilizer. Next, they collected samples to determine the chemical makeup and conducted controlled studies to investigate the exposure level to biosolids on crops and workers. Funding for the work was terminated, however, right as Prasse started to identify and analyze the chemicals—in other words, right as his team inched toward their first results.

""We use around 80,000 chemicals in our homes in household products—detergents, cosmetics, personal care products, pharmaceuticals,"" Prasse said. ""All of these things go down the drain, and most aren't really removed in wastewater."" In the case of biosolids, he continued, ""they contain not just bacteria but everything flushed down the toilet like prescription drugs, pesticides, and industrial chemicals like PFAS"" that are known to cause health problems. ""All of this sticks to the organic material of biosolids.""

The halt in funding is unfortunate for many reasons, Prasse said, including his team's unique ability to identify the array of chemicals—and the quantity of each chemical—in soil and plant samples. In his lab, Prasse uses high-resolution mass spectrometry, a state-of-the-art analytical chemistry technique, to measure the mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) of ions with utmost precision and zero in on the elemental composition of compounds. Now, however, his use of the tool is being cut short, owing to the EPA's decision to stop funding the grant.

Both Prasse and Nachman have had other environmental health-related grants descoped or terminated this past year, despite findings that their research can lead to cost-cutting measures and public health safety. ""In the case of air pollution, every dollar spent on the Clean Air Act results in a $25 to $30 return on investment in terms of health preventions or in terms of disease avoidance,"" Nachman said. ""I mean, that's stunning. How many programs do we have where we get that kind of return on investment?

""This isn't money thrown away,"" he continued. ""It's money that has high return and tremendous societal benefit.""

Zaitchik and Waugh shared similar sentiments, struggling to comprehend the rationale. After all, the grant cancelations and scaled-back funding coincide with a clear uptick in extreme weather, meaning that time is of the essence to gather the data and do the work needed to prepare, they explained.

""It's strange to be rushing head on into these hazards and say, 'Well, we're just going to close our eyes [to extreme weather] and not try to get ready,'"" Zaitchik said. ""This will only hurt and cost more in the long run.""",https://api.hub.jhu.edu/factory/sites/default/files/styles/soft_crop_1300/public/2025-10/Darryn%20Waugh_JHZ9962.jpg,N,,2025-10-15 07:02:05.016482

Three: “Energy Costs Are Up Because We Burn Less Coal” — No, Not Really Yes, energy prices have risen — but across the board.","My sincere thanks to Senator Brian Helton for joining Talkline Tuesday. Debate is essential — and in an energy state like West Virginia, more debate on energy policy isn’t just healthy, it’s necessary.

Before diving in, I’d suggest reading my earlier commentary on this topic or catching Tuesday’s interview with Senator Helton (above).

Energy is a complicated subject; details matter — good or bad, that’s the way it is.

And apologies in advance for a bit of a lengthy piece today. My pen just wouldn’t stop.

Where We Differ

Fundamentally, Senator Helton and I disagree.

He believes requiring utilities to run coal plants at least 69 percent of the time — even when they’re not the least-cost option — would deliver a macro-economic boost to West Virginia, including roughly 3,500 new jobs.

I believe his legislation would increase power bills for West Virginians who already struggle to afford them, while doing little to curb renewables as he desires and potentially harm the state’s natural gas industry in the process.

Decide for yourself; here’s my case.

One: Markets, Not Politics, Should Drive Decisions

Markets are the best arbiters of economic decisions — not politics. Helton’s bill would take markets out of the decision-making process 69 percent of the time.

He argues this would “level the playing field” for coal. But the data shows coal’s challenge isn’t unfair competition — it’s economics.

According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, electricity produced from natural gas ran about $26.50 per MWh (July 2025), based on Henry Hub pricing. It’s important to note Henry Hub pricing doesn’t account for any typical “negative basis” – essentially a lower price than Hub – on locally sourced West Virginia gas.

Electricity produced from Central Appalachian coal tallied $36.69 per MWh. That’s a significant $10 gap or 40% difference.

Common sense check: if you’re driving down the road and gasoline at one station is $2.80 a gallon and $2.00 at the other – 40 percent cheaper – where would you stop?

There’s more.

Gas plants typically operate at 50-plus percent thermal efficiency; coal units, in the low 30s. That makes coal significantly more expensive on a per-MWh basis than natural gas.

As someone with knowledge of power plant operations pointed out to me, you need pulverizers and other equipment that must be powered to crush coal to make it useable in a boiler. Gas plants don’t require fly ash removal equipment and the operating costs that come along with it. The list goes on. With natural gas, you just pump it in from a pipe. Translation: more variable cost with coal.

Because PJM dispatches generation based on marginal cost — mostly driven by fuel, heat rate and other variable costs and efficiencies — gas plants are called upon more often. They’re cheaper, and customers want the cheapest reliable power.

Helton goes further saying renewables are subsidized creating an unfair environment for coal. That’s true. Most renewables enjoy investment or production tax credits made available by the Inflation Reduction Act. But those credits help investors cover the upfront costs of creating wind or solar farms, they don’t – by market rules governing bid calculation – play into establishing marginal costs – they don’t drive energy output price one way or another. It’s fair to say these credits would decrease upfront capital costs and drive capacity costs or the cost of physical equipment (fixed).

All told, Helton’s proposal would ignore these economic and physical realities, forcing coal plants to run even when they’re uneconomic compared to other available units.

My premise in a nutshell: If you need a law to make a plant run, the market already told you it’s not the most economical plant. Listen to it.

Two: “At Least We’d Use Our Coal” — Not So Fast

Helton argues using our coal will displace wind or solar – a “Green New Deal” scam in his words.

That sounds good politically, but it’s not what would actually happen.

According to PJM’s independent market monitor, natural gas set the locational marginal price (LMP) — the price that clears the market — about 74% of the time last year. Coal set it 13%, and all other sources, including renewables, set pricing the remaining 12–13%.

If West Virginia coal units are forced to run uneconomically, the generation most likely displaced wouldn’t be solar or wind — it would be natural gas as it sets the price the majority of the time.

Remember: wind and solar have zero fuel cost. The wind and sun are free. That means when they’re available, they’ll almost always be dispatched.

Helton is right that renewables aren’t as reliable — the sun doesn’t always shine, and the wind doesn’t always blow — but PJM already accounts for that. Renewables are only credited for about 10–15% of their nameplate capacity in the capacity market. In other words, 100 MW of solar is treated as 10–15 MW of dependable capacity — far less than gas, coal, or nuclear. That means renewables do not earn nearly as much capacity revenue as plants that use the former fuel sources.

Three: “Energy Costs Are Up Because We Burn Less Coal” — No, Not Really

Yes, energy prices have risen — but across the board. Using a more expensive fuel more often won’t fix that. It will make it worse.

According to Helton, AEP testified that part of the increase in rates comes from West Virginia’s declining population. That’s true. Fixed costs — poles, transformers, power plants — are spread over fewer customers. Fewer customers to cover the same nut means each customer must pay more.

But Helton confuses those fixed costs with marginal ones.

Electricity is priced on marginal cost – the cost to produce the next required MWh to keep the grid running. Running coal plants 69% of the time won’t change those fixed expenses – running plants 100 percent wouldn’t either, just as not running them at all wouldn’t.

It all just means ratepayers will pay more than they otherwise would for electricity on top of the increasing fixed cost burden. A double whammy!

Another reason for increased electricity prices not noted in Helton’s argument: we’re using more electricity. AI needs more juice. Demand increases mean price increases, especially when supply is constrained via regulation. Building new generation is a massive, slow undertaking.

Four: If It’s a Good Bet, the State Should Take the Risk

Forget my previous points for a moment.

Helton believes his plan would be good for West Virginia. He wants more coal jobs. That’s understandable and I’m not questioning his or others’ sincerity who believe the same.

But at what expense? Are 3,500 coal jobs worth higher electricity bills for the (estimated) more than 1 million customers AEP and First Energy serve? Is that gain worth possible displacement of natural gas jobs? If gas-fired plants run less, you don’t need as much gas, so you don’t need as many people to bring it out of the ground. A job added in one industry is ok if it costs a job in another?

And what about economic development? Why would the “next” Nucor choose West Virginia if our power costs are artificially higher than in neighboring states? They wouldn’t.

I remain steadfast. The legislature should vote red on the bill if it comes to the floor. It may pass the Senate, but my conversations with House members lead me to believe it would be dead on arrival in that chamber.

That being said, if Helton and his colleagues believe in the plan — if this plan would indeed net boost the economy on the whole — then the state should take all the risk, not ratepayers.

If lawmakers want to require coal plants to run for fixed periods of time, they should also require that any added costs above market price of using non-economically dispatched generation be paid from the state’s Rainy Day Fund, not through higher utility bills or new taxes.

If the plan works as well as promised, those new jobs and tax revenues will replenish the fund, no? If it doesn’t, ratepayers wouldn’t be left holding the bag, the state would.

That’s a fair ask. Such an added provision wouldn’t put Toby and Edith directly on the hook – they didn’t ask for more risk or higher bills – as the proposal does now.",https://wvmetronews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/metronews-plug.jpg,N,,2025-10-15 13:09:44.973433

Violet Ikonomova is an investigative reporter at the Free Press focused on government and police accountability in Detroit.","In 2018, as thousands of Detroit households faced water shutoffs or tax foreclosures, a then-31-year-old Councilmember Mary Sheffield stood before city hall to unveil the “People’s Bills,” a sweeping package of housing affordability and other proposals designed to protect the city’s most vulnerable residents.

The headline-grabbing plans were among some of the boldest from a Detroit City Council member in recent memory, according to several political watchers. But they drew swift resistance from Mayor Mike Duggan’s more fiscally conservative regime. With a council majority then in Duggan’s corner, the proposals would yield mixed results, ending in a blend of wins, losses and political compromise.

An apt metaphor for Sheffield’s political career: Political observers say Sheffield’s achievements are notable for a council member who was for years in the political minority in a city with a strong-mayor form of government and law department that serves both the mayor and the council.

Former Councilmember Raquel Castañeda-López, who served with Sheffield for her first two terms, said Sheffield struck a balance between policy ambition and coalition-building, both on the council and in the community.

“She was better and more successful at collaborating than I was,” said Castañeda-López, who has not endorsed a candidate for mayor. “All of us have made promises we couldn’t fulfill. But … sometimes when legislation doesn’t happen, you’re able to make change in other ways.”

In her 12 years as a council policymaker, Sheffield often aimed high and got some of what she wanted, but was forced to scale back parts of her most ambitious populist visions amid pressure from the mayor’s office. Now, as a frontrunner for the city’s top job as she faces off against the Rev. Solomon Kinloch of Triumph Church, she says she may revive some of those proposals that previously stalled — if she wins.

Not surprisingly, her opponent has taken a harsher view of her council tenure, accusing Sheffield of “12 years of failed leadership” and “delivering headlines without delivering progress.” The pastor has never held elected office and does not have a comparable record to scrutinize.

However, current and former council members who spoke with the Free Press said Sheffield consistently followed through when possible, and helped elevate visibility around issues she couldn’t legislate.

“She is a person, if she puts something out there, she believes in it and I think is willing to die on that sword getting it across the finish line,” Councilmember Fred Durhal, who ran against Sheffield for mayor in the primary and has since endorsed her, said.

Sheffield’s achievements include key ordinances to increase housing stability and improve working conditions for those employed by city contractors or certain industries. Sheffield also has notched wins with ordinances that required compromise, like a 50% parking ticket rate reduction for Detroiters who pay early.

But Sheffield never introduced promised ordinances to increase Detroit hiring on publicly funded construction projects and her proposal to tie water rates to household incomes — which she once called her “most crucial” initiative. She also has thus far come up empty handed in her quest to reimburse property owners who were overtaxed by the city.

In response to Free Press questions, the now-council president said she has spearheaded approximately two dozen successful ordinances, resolutions and budget appropriations. Of proposals she could not get off the ground, Sheffield blamed legal obstacles raised by Duggan’s administration, but said they still helped increase awareness of the socioeconomic issues affecting Detroiters.

“When I came to council, these were issues that people didn’t want to talk about,” she said. “I’m very proud we passed a majority of them. And on those we didn’t, we pushed the conversation.”

Wins

Sheffield took office in 2014 as the youngest-ever Detroit councilmember, and in her second term unfurled a grassroots and union activist-guided agenda that put her at odds with budget-conscious and development-friendly Duggan, who was then supported by a council majority. Things shifted in Sheffield’s third term, when a number of newcomers joined the council and voted her president, and an infusion of federal pandemic relief funds made a broad range of initiatives possible. Duggan has since endorsed Sheffield for mayor.

Sheffield has led the passage of two key ordinances to address the drivers of tax foreclosure, including a 2023 measure targeting inflated property assessments and a 2018 measure easing barriers to a property tax exemption for the poor that has helped more than double the number of tax-exempt households in the city.

In 2022, she spearheaded an ordinance to provide free legal representation to Detroiters facing eviction after reporting found 1 in 5 Detroit renters face eviction each year, often by landlords who themselves operate illegally. The Right to Counsel program has since boosted the percentage of those with lawyers from 4% before the pandemic to up to 70% this year, those involved say.

Sheffield also led the creation of a 2023 “responsible contracting” ordinance that gives preference to contractors who offer employee benefits and meet other criteria, and a 2021 “industry standards boards” ordinance aimed to improve conditions for workers employed in certain industries, like the city’s stadiums or arenas.

In 2021, she won an ordinance increasing transparency around surveillance technologies after the city was sued at least three times by people who alleged they were wrongfully arrested by Detroit police using facial recognition software.

Political push-pull

Other proposals fell short of goals, typically through compromise with the administration.

In 2017, Sheffield sought to require developers receiving city incentives to designate a portion of rental units as affordable for households earning as little as 50% of the region’s median income. The Duggan administration, however, won an amendment raising that threshold to 80% — or $56,600 for an individual — far above what the average Detroiter earns.

Sheffield sought to counteract the ordinance’s limitations by attaching an “affordable housing trust fund” for those living at as little as 30% area median income. She has since grown the fund to $15 million by capturing 40% of city commercial land sales. If elected mayor, she says she would raise the percentage collected to at least 90% and revisit the requirements on developers.

Her effort to repay city property owners after a 2020 news report found they were overtaxed by a collective $600 million also has involved some political jockeying. The Duggan administration has interpreted state law to mean they can’t be repaid. And Sheffield, in 2022, requested a separate legal opinion from Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel on the issue. She was rebuffed, and now says she’ll push to change the law in Lansing if elected mayor.

As an alternative to repayment, Sheffield in 2022 led the creation of a package of city programmatic and discount offerings for those who were overtaxed, like half-off Detroit Land Bank Authority homes and first dibs on affordable housing.

The plan represented another political tug of war: Duggan, two years earlier, had proposed a $6 million package that would have applied to those overtaxed from 2010 – 2013, but Sheffield rejected it, calling its price tag and eligibility years inadequate. The plan Sheffield ultimately helped pass was funded at the same dollar amount, but with eligibility expanded through 2016. (Residents have until the end of the year to apply for the offerings; approximately 700 residents have already done so or are in the process.)

Meanwhile, at least one high-profile Sheffield effort has been stymied without the Duggan factor. A task force Sheffield helped establish to recommend reparations for Detroiters harmed by historic racism is now a year behind schedule after problems involving one of her appointees who helped create the group.

Proposals left behind

While Sheffield’s movements on housing and other issues made headlines, two “People’s Bills” were never introduced.

A marquee plan to tie water rates to household income was dropped after Duggan said it would violate state law. Sheffield later said she developed a workaround — treating discounted rates as “bad debt” — but ultimately abandoned that too, citing the same legal concerns. She said the fight then moved to Lansing, where a state bill she supports now mirrors her original proposal.

Duggan, meanwhile, launched the Lifeline water assistance program in 2022, calling it the city’s “first income-based water affordability” program. The program, however, relied on pandemic relief funds that have since run out. Sheffield said she continues to push for state funding to sustain it.

Sheffield also never introduced an ordinance to expand a Duggan executive order requiring publicly funded construction projects to give a majority of work hours to Detroiters. Her 2018 proposal would have lowered the investment threshold for the requirement to kick in from $3 million to $500,000, but, she said, was ultimately blocked by a legal interpretation that the City Council can’t set contracting terms.

Still, Sheffield pointed to the administration’s eventual decision to ensure the hiring mandate applied to demolition projects as a result of her efforts. If elected mayor, she said she would only revive the proposal once she can ensure contractors actually comply — according to a recent BridgeDetroit report, none of the 35 tracked projects currently do.

Advocates split, politicos say she excelled

Advocates are divided on Sheffield’s record. Some credit her with keeping critical issues in the spotlight, even when legislation stalled.

“She was good at keeping water affordability in the news,” said Sylvia Orduño, a local organizer with the People’s Water Board Coalition. “Making it part of the ‘People’s Bills’ emphasized that water and sanitation is a human right.”

Others were less convinced.

“She ain’t done nothing,” said Tahira Ahmad, a member of the Detroit Coalition for Property Tax Justice, who said she was overtaxed by $30,000 but can’t benefit from the city’s current compensation offerings. “It’s just all about a political game with her.”

Former council member Sheila Cockrel, also unaffiliated in the mayor’s race, said Sheffield brought a rare level of policy focus to her council role.

“I have watched Mary as a member of council and council president approach the position with a clear intellectual policy structure to her work,” Cockrel said, referring to the “People’s Bills.” “She actually had a frame of reference for the work she brought forward — and she named it and moved to execute.”

Both Castañeda-López and Durhal said Sheffield’s high-profile agenda may have invited an unwarranted degree of scrutiny.

“It’s almost like the more you perform, the more that’s demanded of you,” Castañeda-López said. “There’s so much pressure and expectation for you to just know everything and fix everything … until you’re in the role, it’s really hard to understand the inner workings.”

The carmaker announced on 14th October 2025 plans to invest $13bn over four years in its US operations, marking the largest single capital commitment in its century-long American history. The investment promises to reshape the company's North American manufacturing footprint - adding five new vehicle programmes, reopening a shuttered Illinois assembly plant, and creating more than 5,000 jobs across four states in the industrial Midwest.

Francesco Ciancia returns to lead Stellantis global production

Stellantis has appointed Francesco Ciancia as Global Head of Manufacturing, reuniting with an executive whose international experience in lean production and transformation will shape its future operations.

The scale of the commitment is remarkable, not merely for its size, but for its timing. Whilst rivals have hedged their manufacturing strategies, dispersing investments across multiple continents, Stellantis has opted for production concentration. The plan targets a 50% increase in annual finished vehicle production capacity, complemented by 19 product refreshes spanning its entire US assembly network through 2029.

This represents a decisive and significant recalibration of the OEM's global manufacturing strategy, elevating US production from a regional priority to a cornerstone of worldwide competitiveness.

""This investment in the US – the single largest in the Company's history – will drive our growth, strengthen our manufacturing footprint and bring more American jobs to the states we call home,"" said Antonio Filosa, Stellantis CEO and North America COO. ""As we begin our next 100 years, we are putting the customer at the center of our strategy, expanding our vehicle offerings and giving them the freedom to choose the products they want and love.""

The investment arrives at a moment of strategic inflection for Stellantis. Having weathered the consolidation that created the company from the merger of Fiat Chrysler and PSA Group, the OEM now confronts questions about its long-term positioning in the world's second-largest automotive market. Mr Filosa's comments suggest an answer rooted in manufacturing presence rather than import dependency.

The anatomy of a $13bn manufacturing pledge

Tariffs, trade shifts, and EV turbulence: How Trump’s second term is reshaping North American auto manufacturing

North American vehicle manufacturing is undergoing major changes. These are in response to political actions, wider market factors and some interesting decisions by major vehicle companies

The financial architecture of Stellantis's commitment extends beyond simple factory investment. The $13bn envelope encompasses research and development expenditure, supplier ecosystem development, and manufacturing infrastructure modernisation. The integrated approach reflects contemporary automotive economics, where vehicle programmes demand coordinated investments across design, engineering, and production systems, hearkening to the enhanced Design for Manufacture (DfM) systems that put Chinese automakers far ahead of their 'Western' contemporaries.

Yet the announcement's true significance lies in its geographic concentration. Rather than dispersing capital across its global network, Stellantis has chosen to concentrate resources in four adjoining states: Illinois, Ohio, Michigan, and Indiana. This clustering strategy promises operational efficiencies through supplier proximity, logistics optimisation, and workforce mobility. It also carries political resonance, concentrating job creation in states that have experienced decades of manufacturing employment decline.

The product portfolio underlying the investment spans multiple segments and powertrain architectures. Five new vehicle programmes will join 19 product refreshes, creating what the company describes as a ""regular cadence"" of launches through 2029. This rhythm of introductions aims to maintain product competitiveness whilst avoiding the feast-or-famine cycle that has plagued automotive manufacturers in previous decades.

""Accelerating growth in the US has been a top priority since my first day. Success in America is not just good for Stellantis in the US — it makes us stronger everywhere,"" Filosa said.

From closure to resurrection at Belvidere, Illinois

Perhaps no element of the investment carries greater symbolic weight than the planned resurrection of the Belvidere Assembly Plant. Stellantis intends to invest more than $600m to reopen the facility, which will expand production of the Jeep Cherokee and Jeep Compass for the American market.

The vehicle producer anticipates the reopening will create approximately 3,300 jobs, with initial production launch expected in 2027. The Belvidere reopening reverses one of the more contentious manufacturing decisions in recent Stellantis history.

The facility's closure had become emblematic of the challenges facing industrial communities in the American Midwest, where automotive employment has contracted sharply over the past two decades. Its revival transforms the plant from a symbol of industrial decline into an anchor of regional economic revitalisation.

The economic calculus supporting Belvidere's resurrection reflects broader shifts in automotive manufacturing. Rising logistics costs, supply chain fragility exposed during pandemic disruptions, and growing political pressure for domestic production have altered the economics of global manufacturing networks. What appeared uneconomical several years ago now presents compelling returns, particularly for vehicles serving primarily domestic markets.

Reconfiguring the Toledo, Ohio production ecosystem for increased flexibility

Ohio emerges as a second major beneficiary of the investment programme. With nearly $400m in capital commitment, Stellantis plans to produce an all-new midsize truck at the Toledo Assembly Complex, where it will share production lines with the Jeep Wrangler and Jeep Gladiator. The programme, originally allocated to Belvidere, could create more than 900 jobs. Production launch is anticipated in 2028.

The flexible assembly line: How vehicle production learned to hedge its bets

Market uncertainty has forced manufacturers to abandon fixed production lines. Honda, BMW and Volkswagen are investing billions in systems that can switch between combustion, hybrid and electric vehicles by the hour.

The Toledo investment illustrates the company's approach to manufacturing flexibility. By consolidating multiple vehicle programmes within single facilities, Stellantis aims to achieve economies of scope whilst maintaining the ability to adjust production volumes in response to market demand. The strategy reflects lessons learned from previous cycles, when dedicated single-product facilities struggled during market downturns.

Beyond the new truck programme, Stellantis confirmed its intention to proceed with previously announced Toledo investments. These include advanced technologies and product enhancements for both the Wrangler and Gladiator, alongside expanded component production at the Toledo Machining Plant. The integrated approach treats the Toledo complex as an ecosystem rather than a collection of discrete facilities.

Michigan's dual-powertrain gambit

Michigan's allocation within the investment programme reflects the industry's technological uncertainty. Stellantis plans to develop an all-new range-extended electric vehicle and internal combustion engine large SUV for production at the Warren Truck Assembly Plant beginning in 2028. The company will invest nearly $100m to retool the facility, with the new programme anticipated to add more than 900 jobs to a plant currently assembling the Jeep Wagoneer and Grand Wagoneer.

The dual-powertrain strategy hedges against technological and regulatory uncertainty. By developing both range-extended EV and traditional internal combustion variants simultaneously, Stellantis positions itself to respond to market preferences that remain unclear. The approach acknowledges that whilst regulatory pressure favours electrification, consumer adoption patterns continue to diverge from policy ambitions.

Stellantis also expects to invest $130m preparing the Detroit Assembly Complex at Jefferson for production of the next-generation Dodge Durango, reaffirming a commitment announced in January. Production launch is anticipated in 2029, extending the facility's production timeline and securing employment for its workforce.

Kokomo, Indiana's four-cylinder engine and 'strategic powertrain' play

The investment programme extends beyond vehicle assembly to powertrain manufacturing. Stellantis confirmed plans to make additional investments exceeding $100m across several Kokomo, Indiana facilities to produce the all-new GMET4 EVO four-cylinder engine beginning in 2026. The programme will add more than 100 jobs, ensuring American production of what the company characterises as a 'strategic powertrain'.

The four-cylinder engine investment merits attention for its strategic implications. At a moment when industry discourse emphasises electrification, Stellantis has committed substantial capital to advanced internal combustion technology. The GMET4 EVO designation suggests evolutionary improvements in efficiency and emissions performance, positioning the engine as a bridge technology during the extended transition to electrification.

Read - Analysis: Carmakers face flux with flexible production as labour crisis deepens

Fourth annual survey reveals workforce challenges remain paramount whilst production flexibility emerges as new complexity. Early data suggests fundamental shift in how manufacturers approach capacity and agility in uncertain times.

The decision to locate four-cylinder production in America rather than importing engines from lower-cost manufacturing locations reflects changing economics. Currency fluctuations, logistics costs, and tariff considerations increasingly favour regional manufacturing for regional markets. The Kokomo investment also strengthens the company's bargaining position in future trade negotiations, demonstrating domestic manufacturing commitment.

Stellantis's American footprint now encompasses 34 manufacturing facilities, parts distribution centres, and research and development locations across 14 states. These operations support more than 48,000 employees, 2,600 dealers, and nearly 2,300 suppliers in thousands of communities nationwide. The October announcement builds upon previously announced actions from January 2025, suggesting a sustained commitment to American manufacturing expansion rather than a one-time capital deployment.

The $13bn commitment represents more than financial engineering. It signals a fundamental reassessment of global manufacturing strategy, elevating American production from cost centre to competitive advantage. Whether this wager on the industrial heartland delivers promised returns will determine not merely Stellantis's future in America, but its positioning in the global automotive hierarchy.",https://image.automotivemanufacturingsolutions.com/1584705.jpg?imageId=1584705&x=0&y=12.5&cropw=100&croph=71.67&panox=0&panoy=12.5&panow=100&panoh=71.67&width=1200&height=683,N,,2025-10-15 08:06:08.272862

Rather than doubling down on a single path, Stellantis’ Stellantis investment strategy is betting that the road ahead is multi-energy, not EV exclusive.","Stellantis has unveiled a bold $13 billion investment plan for its U.S. operations over the next four years, a move that signals a sharp recalibration of its Stellantis investment priorities. Instead of doubling down on a full EV push, the company is directing major capital toward internal combustion engines (ICE), hybrid and range-extended powertrains, and flexible platforms that can pivot among multiple energy sources. This strategic pivot has broad implications for the automaker’s financial outlook, the competitive auto industry, and EV stocks.

A New Strategic Direction: Why Stellantis Investment Is Shifting

Since the merger of Fiat Chrysler and PSA, Stellantis has positioned itself as an industry leader in electrification, pledging massive capital toward battery electric vehicles (BEVs). But the latest plan reveals a rethink: only one of five new vehicle programs under the $13B package is described as a range-extended EV, while the rest lean toward ICE, hybrids, and multi-energy architectures.

Stellantis’ CEO Antonio Filosa emphasizes that the strategy is not abandoning electrification, but rather optimizing flexibility. A key driver is the lackluster EV demand across large segments and the increasingly stringent qualification rules for battery tax credits. Many buyers remain hesitant to adopt full BEVs, especially in truck and SUV markets.

By anchoring the $13 billion toward plant reopenings, engine investments, hybrid platforms, and adaptable lines, Stellantis hedges its bets. The approach is pragmatic, giving the company optionality to pivot as regulations, incentives, and consumer tastes evolve.

Where the Money Goes: Breakdown of the $13 B U.S. Investment

The investment is spread across multiple states and product lines. Here’s a regional and program-level view:

Illinois & Midwest (Belvidere, Kokomo, etc.)

Reopening the Belvidere Assembly Plant (Illinois) with over $600 million investment, intended to produce Jeep Cherokee and Compass models domestically, creating ~3,300 jobs.

A new four-cylinder engine (GMET4 EVO) will be built in Kokomo, Indiana, starting in 2026, with over $100 million in investment.

Ohio / Michigan

A new midsize truck program moves to Toledo, Ohio, with a nearly $400 million investment.

Allocation of $130 million in Detroit’s Jefferson plant to produce the next-gen Dodge Durango (ICE or hybrid) by 2029.

The Warren Truck Assembly Plant (Michigan) will be retooled for a range-extended EV and an ICE large SUV by 2028.

R&D, Supplier & Infrastructure

Upgrades to parts suppliers, battery line intersections, and tooling to support both ICE and electrified platforms.

19 product refreshes and new powertrain programs through 2029.

In sum, the portfolio tilts toward hybrid and ICE growth, with electrification playing a supporting yet cautious role.

Impacts on Stock & Auto Market Dynamics

1. Stellantis Investment and Stock Market Signals

Investors and stock research teams are interpreting the pivot with mixed signals. On one hand, the $13B infusion sends a message: Stellantis is doubling down on profitability rather than an EV arms race. But critics argue that the shift could leave the company vulnerable should full electrification accelerate faster than expected.

In after-hours trading, Stellantis shares jumped ~4% following the announcement. Analysts are now reevaluating future earnings growth, free cash flow, and margin assumptions, particularly as the company delays its next strategic update to Q2 2026.

This repositioning places Stellantis somewhere between aggressive EV bets and cautious legacy bets, a middle ground that may attract investors seeking balance in stock market volatility across the auto sector.

2. Competitive Landscape & EV Stocks

Other automakers are also rethinking pure EV trajectories:

General Motors is amplifying its hybrid commitment in North America while extending EV programs.

Ford is pushing hybrid versions of trucks and delaying full BEV domination.

Pure EV plays like Tesla remain benchmarks, yet face scaling and margin pressures.

Stellantis’ flexibility may give it a competitive advantage when EV stock sentiment cycles, especially if supply chain or regulatory risk upend rigid strategies.

3. Risks of Being Too Conservative

The biggest risk? Falling behind in a rapidly electrifying world. If lithium-ion battery costs plunge or charging infrastructure improvement accelerates, those betting heavily on ICE or hybrid could suffer.

Stellantis’ ability to adjust pace will be tested, especially in Europe, where emissions standards and zero-emissions mandates loom. Already, the company backed away from hydrogen vehicle development to focus on EVs and hybrids.

Why Stellantis Is Betting on Flexibility

This $13 billion plan signals a deeper philosophy, not to pick one technology winner, but to stay versatile across energy sources. Several strategic rationales explain this:

Consumer hesitancy: EV adoption still lags in many U.S. markets, especially in trucks and rural areas.

Regulatory ambiguity: Rules around battery credits, emissions, and mandates keep shifting.

Margin stability: ICE and hybrid platforms have mature supply chains and more predictable margins.

Execution risk: Building BEV capacity is capital-intensive and risky; mistakes are costly.

Optionality: If EV demand surges later, Stellantis can scale those projects while still monetizing existing platforms.

Rather than doubling down on a single path, Stellantis’ Stellantis investment strategy is betting that the road ahead is multi-energy, not EV exclusive.

Looking Ahead: What to Watch

Timing of launches: The GMET4 engine in 2026 and new vehicles (2028–2029) will reveal how execution plays out.

EV tax credit eligibility: Changes in battery sourcing rules will influence product viability.

Market response: Consumer adoption curves may validate or penalize this bet.

Regulatory shifts: EU and U.S. mandates toward zero emissions could force faster pivots.

Stock moves in the auto sector: Investor rotation into or out of EV stocks may shift sentiment for Stellantis.

Stellantis is essentially pressing pause on all-in EV urgency, preferring to build a resilient, adjustable platform that can flex with disruption.

Conclusion

Stellantis’ decision to channel its investment emphasis away from pure electric vehicle programs and toward multi-energy, flexible platforms is a bold move. It bets on adaptability over ideology, allowing them to hedge risk and hold options. In doing so, the company may appeal to investors wary of all-electric swings, even as it must guard against falling behind if the EV wave accelerates far beyond projections.

For those tracking AI stocks or market sectors tied to energy transition, Stellantis now presents an interesting case of industrial reinvention rather than disruption. As stock research updates flow in, this $13 billion pivot could become a defining moment in the auto investment narrative.

The progress report, Delivering on the UAE Consensus: Tracking progress toward tripling renewable energy capacity and doubling energy efficiency by 2030 also highlights that energy efficiency is an equally great concern.
While renewable energy investments grew by 7% in 2024, actual disbursements remain far below the levels required to build robust project pipelines and accelerate construction.
As to supply chains, fair and transparent trade practices must be ensured for critical renewable energy technologies and international co-operation pursued to safeguard trade corridors for key materials and components.
Furthermore, strategic investment in modernising and expanding electricity grids is the essential foundation for integrating new capacity and strengthening energy security.","In 2024, global renewable capacity additions reached an unprecedented 582 GW. Yet this is still not enough to stay on track for the COP28 UAE Consensus target of tripling renewables to 11.2 TW by 2030. Meeting that goal now demands a staggering 1 122 GW of added capacity every year from 2025 onward, requiring annual growth to accelerate to 16.6% through the decade, according to the second official tracking report on the landmark energy goals set by the UAE Consensus at COP28.

The progress report, Delivering on the UAE Consensus: Tracking progress toward tripling renewable energy capacity and doubling energy efficiency by 2030 also highlights that energy efficiency is an equally great concern. Global energy intensity improved by just 1% in 2024, far below the 4% annual gains needed to meet the UAE Consensus goal and keep the 1.5°C target alive.

The report calls for urgent action to:

integrate renewable targets into national climate plans (NDC 3.0) ahead of COP30 in Belém;

double collective NDC ambition to align with the global renewables goal; and

scale investment in renewables to at least USD 1.4 trillion per year in 2025–2030 –more than doubling the USD 624 billion invested in 2024.

The world’s major advanced and emerging economies must take the lead, according to the recommendations of the new report. G20 nations are projected to account for over 80% of global renewables by 2030, with the richest developed economies of the G7 expected to shoulder a leadership role by raising their share to around 20% of global capacity within this decade.

Major global economies must also deliver on climate finance, meeting the USD 300 billion annual floor of the new collective quantified goal (NCQG) and scaling up towards the aspirational USD 1.3 trillion confirmed at COP29 in Azerbaijan.

Beyond renewables, the report underlines the urgent need for investment in grids, supply chains, and clean-tech manufacturing for solar, wind, batteries and hydrogen.

While renewable energy investments grew by 7% in 2024, actual disbursements remain far below the levels required to build robust project pipelines and accelerate construction. As to supply chains, fair and transparent trade practices must be ensured for critical renewable energy technologies and international co-operation pursued to safeguard trade corridors for key materials and components.

Furthermore, strategic investment in modernising and expanding electricity grids is the essential foundation for integrating new capacity and strengthening energy security. Between now and 2030, an estimated USD 670 billion must be directed each year towards grids, with further investment required to rapidly scale up energy storage solutions, facilitate renewable integration and safeguard grid stability.

The Trump administration’s bias against clean energy technologies blinds it to economic reality.
The most significant global clean energy investment in 2024 was in solar energy; at $450 billion, that’s double the global investments in coal.
Today, ​​hydro, wind, and solar energy comprise 30 percent of China’s energy generation, with more wind and solar than coal.
These Chinese clean energy investments carry obvious climate benefits.","Until this year, America was set to embark on its largest investments in history toward clean and affordable energy and good-paying jobs. Congress included more than $350 billion in tax credits, appropriated grants and loans for domestic clean energy projects and manufacturing as part of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). In 2021, Congress passed the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL), which also appropriated $60 billion to modernize our nation’s energy infrastructure.

​​​The Trump administration has now tossed that progress out the window.

​​​​​​​During the first days of the government shutdown, the Department of Energy (DOE) announced it would halt almost $8 billion in electrical grid upgrades and new spending on a range of clean energy technologies, from renewables to carbon capture.

DOE is also ​​expected to cut tens of billions more in energy infrastructure projects in the coming weeks. This is in addition to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) cutting the Solar for All ​​program, which would have provided ​​billions of dollars in clean energy investments that help low-income communities reduce energy costs. Instead, it plans to invest millions in our nation’s oldest coal plants as part of President Donald Trump’s efforts to bring back “​​beautiful” coal.

The Trump administration’s efforts are both confounding and counterproductive. Ripping funds away from grid infrastructure, manufacturers, and energy producers will ​​delay reliable cheap energy for millions of Americans suffering from high energy prices and shut the U.S. out of a booming international clean energy market.

Across the country, in both red states and blue states, public and private stakeholders alike have clamored for the clean energy funding appropriated in these bills. When I was a senior official at the ​​Office of Management and Budget (OMB) during President Joe Biden’s administration, ​​we found that most new clean energy IRA and BIL programs were heavily overprescribed. The Trump administration’s rescissions of appropriated and obligated funds are blocking these critical investments just as they are starting to flow into communities.

While the potential climate benefits of the IRA and the BIL have received significant attention, the economic benefits expected to flow from these two laws have too often been buried in the broader climate battle between the political parties. Both laws promoted energy diversification and technology-neutral solutions. Implementing both laws promised lower energy costs, stronger economic growth, and a challenge to China’s dominance over global clean energy supply chains.

For instance, both the IRA and BIL greatly expanded the DOE’s ​​Loan Programs Office, providing billions for loan guarantees to diverse clean technologies such as nuclear, microgrids, and natural gas pipelines. The IRA also created technology-neutral energy tax credits, which, for the first time, would have incentivized investments in emissions reductions rather than in specific technologies. In addition, the IRA created a Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, which authorized regional energy infrastructure banks to leverage private investments in low- and zero-emission energy technologies for capital-starved communities.

Even technology-targeted efforts were focused on quickly bringing clean, cheap energy to market and giving U.S. manufacturers a leg-up in global markets. The IRA’s new EPA Solar for All program, for instance, provided​​ funds for states, Tribal governments, and local jurisdictions to support low-income solar projects, while the BIL’s Hydrogen Hubs created new economic development centers in clean hydrogen across the country.

The Trump administration’s bias against clean energy technologies blinds it to economic reality. In a recent ​​interview with Breitbart, Department of Energy Secretary Chris Wright called investments in renewable energy, transmission line expansions, and battery technologies one of the “greatest malinvestments” in human history. Yet, global investments in these technologies are booming. According to ​​​​International Energy Agency (IEA)’s World Energy Investment report, approximately $2.2 trillion in global investments went toward renewables, nuclear, transmission, storage, low-emissions fuels, efficiency, and electrification. That​​ is a trillion dollars more than a decade ago and a trillion more than the year’s combined oil, gas, and coal investments. The most significant global clean energy investment in 2024 was in solar energy; at $450 billion, that’s double the global investments in coal.

The largest global investor in both coal and solar is China. Republicans often point to Beijing’s plan to add 94.5 gigawatts of new coal capacity to justify doubling down on coal. But China’s coal investments are part of a broader strategy focused on diversification, stability, and economic opportunity. China has limited domestic natural gas resources, and ​its ​nuclear capacity is about 40 percent lower than U.S. generation. Along with population pressures, global markets, and political volatility in coal-rich Xinjiang, all of these factors shape China’s choices.

There is still time for Congress and the administration to reverse course, but every day leaves the U.S. further behind. Unlike the Trump administration, China invests in all energy sources while modernizing its energy system. In addition to adding nuclear and coal generation capacity, China is making historic investments in wind, solar, battery storage, grid modernization, and electrification. According to a ​​2025 report by the International Society for Energy Transition Studies and Ember ​​​​​Energy Research (​EMBER), China spent $625 billion on clean energy in 2024 and more than ​​doubled its wind and solar generation capacity over three years to 1,408 gigawatts. Today, ​​hydro, wind, and solar energy comprise 30 percent of China’s energy generation, with more wind and solar than coal. The same ISETS/EMBER report found that China also tripled its energy storage capacity over the past three years, commissioning more battery storage in 2024 than the U.S. and Europe combined. It also ​​invested the equivalent of ​​$600 billion in grid modernization and electrification in 2024 alone.

These Chinese clean energy investments carry obvious climate benefits. President Xi Jinping recently announced that China would cut peak greenhouse gas emissions by up to 10 percent in the next decade. That is despite Beijing’s ongoing coal investments, and at a time when most countries fail to meet their greenhouse gas emission targets. State support and larger production scale help Chinese manufacturers reduce costs, cut domestic energy prices, and strengthen their competitive advantage overseas.

According to the Climate Leadership Council’s analysis of data from a 2024 IEA Energy Technology Perspectives report, Chinese exports of clean energy technologies to emerging markets increased 125 percent over three years, reaching $96 billion by 2023. In comparison, U.S. exports only reached $10 billion. Chinese global dominance is moreover growing, with China’s clean energy exports projected to surpass $340 billion by 2035—on par with 2024 oil export revenues generated by Saudi Arabia and the UAE combined.

Every dollar withheld from modernizing our energy system is a gift to our economic rivals. Shelving Biden-era investments delays much-needed, cheap energy for American households and businesses. It’s time for Congress to intervene. Doing so will reassert U.S. leadership and grow our economy.",https://i0.wp.com/washingtonmonthly.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AP25237567887218-scaled.jpg?fit=2560%2C1920&quality=89&ssl=1,N,,2025-10-15 05:58:49.532671

Yet despite these natural advantages, high production costs, scarce affordable financing, limited government support, and weak industrial policies continue to constrain the continent’s manufacturing ambitions.
Emerging projects like South Africa’s 300-megawatt Seraphim solar panel manufacturing plant suggest that African countries may yet capture a foothold in the solar manufacturing value chain.
Instead, he suggested, African economies could focus on assembly or specialized products that complement Chinese manufacturing.
The answer will determine how — and how much — the continent can benefit from the solar manufacturing value chain in the years ahead.","China’s manufacturing dominance remains tightly bound to Africa’s struggle for energy access. The continent holds the raw materials essential for producing renewable energy technologies, yet its factories lack the scale and efficiency to compete with China’s vast industrial base.

As a result, African nations remain reliant on Chinese-made equipment even as they seek to climb the manufacturing value chain.

WiSolar, a solar energy firm operating in South Africa and Nigeria, illustrates this dynamic. Founded in 2016 as an inverter Original Equipment Manufacturer, the company eventually shifted its production to China, citing the prohibitive costs of manufacturing locally and the competitive advantages of China’s industrial ecosystem.

Tin, Copper, And Silicon Reserves For Solar Panel Production

Tonye Irims, WiSolar’s founder and chief executive, points out that Africa’s solar potential is vast, underpinned by its abundant reserves of tin, copper, and silicon, essential materials for solar panel production. Yet despite these natural advantages, high production costs, scarce affordable financing, limited government support, and weak industrial policies continue to constrain the continent’s manufacturing ambitions.

Emerging projects like South Africa’s 300-megawatt Seraphim solar panel manufacturing plant suggest that African countries may yet capture a foothold in the solar manufacturing value chain. Seraphim, officially known as Jiangsu Seraphim Solar System Co., Ltd., produces both rooftop solar modules and the photovoltaic cells that power them, with some units made in South Africa sold as far away as the United States.

Still, the goal need not be to build industries that compete head-on with China. “If you talk to these Chinese manufacturers, you know it’s very cost-effective to produce in China,” said Yixian Sun, an associate professor of international development at the University of Bath. “But if they see benefits in investing locally — if host governments offer incentives and stable policies — there’s a strong incentive to explore new manufacturing markets.”

Small Solar Panels Tailored to Household Use

Given the complexity of producing solar panels from raw materials to finished products, Dr. Sun added, it remains unrealistic for countries with limited industrial bases to start from scratch. Instead, he suggested, African economies could focus on assembly or specialized products that complement Chinese manufacturing. “Maybe we can do some assemblage that helps Chinese manufacturers lower export costs, while creating local jobs and encouraging governments to offer tax incentives,” he said.

Such arrangements could also open space for local innovation. In Pakistan, for instance, small solar panels tailored to household use are made domestically because they are too low-margin for Chinese firms to produce efficiently. “Similarly, different African countries may find niches to specialize in, while Chinese companies can offer technology and expertise,” Dr. Sun noted.

Resources, Incentives and Policies to Sustain Industrial Development

Muyi Yang, a senior energy analyst at the global think tank, Ember, agreed that a few regional manufacturing hubs may eventually serve the entire continent. “There isn’t a single country that has a completely clean-energy equipment supply chain,” he said. “Africa will likely see a few hubs emerge to provide equipment and facilities across borders. That’s a more realistic scenario.”

Even in cases where manufacturing is unfeasible, Yang said, countries can still gain valuable know-how. “There will be technological spillover, because you need local staff for installation, operation, and maintenance,” he said. Some equipment — such as large solar floaters — may even be cheaper to produce locally because of high shipping costs. “That creates demand for complementary industries to grow,” he added.

Ultimately, the question for African policymakers is whether they have the resources, incentives, and coherent policies to sustain industrial development. The answer will determine how — and how much — the continent can benefit from the solar manufacturing value chain in the years ahead.",https://chinaglobalsouth.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AFP__20250220__cfoto-chinapvm250220_npUVX__v1__HighRes__ChinaPvManufacturingIndustry-768x448.jpg,N,,2025-10-15 11:03:25.827792

The next day, the Trump Administration announced the termination of 321 awards, claiming $7.5 billion in cuts for clean energy projects. Inside Climate News recently reported that many of these awards were already past their end date.

Empire Clean Cities, which promotes the advancement of alternative fuels and alternative-fuel vehicles to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, was among the organizations that had its funds cut.

The Manhattan-based nonprofit will lose more than 90 percent of the funds for its $1.7 million award. So far, Empire Clean Cities had received only $162,631 of its award for a project designed to reduce emissions in Hunts Point in the Bronx, according to federal spending data. Largely due to truck traffic, this neighborhood has an annual child asthma hospitalization rate double the citywide average.

“It’s where folks live and work, and so they see every day the impact of truck traffic emissions on their air quality, on their health,” said Joy Gardner, the executive director of Empire Clean Cities. “This was a real opportunity to make a drastic change in just the general quality of life.”

Hunts Point attracts a high volume of freight traffic partly due to its proximity to food centers, including the Hunts Point Food Distribution Center. The city estimates that the center distributes around 4.5 billion pounds of food every year.

Empire Clean Cities is on the cusp of publishing an electrification plan for Hunts Point, with engagement from local businesses, communities and city agencies. The plan would offer a pathway to electrification for vehicles operating in the neighborhood—and subsequently help alleviate the health issues many residents face.

Though Gardner said the plan is likely to still be published, other aspects of the plan could be delayed or may not happen at all. The nonprofit planned to install six fast-charging electric ports in the neighborhoods, for personal and freight vehicles, according to Gardner.

Empire Clean Cities also planned to provide technical assistance to businesses looking to electrify their truck fleets and information sessions for community members who might want to buy an electric vehicle. According to federal spending data, the nonprofit would “undertake an extensive suite of community outreach activities designed to break down the knowledge barriers preventing [electric vehicle] adoption in the neighborhood.”

“It’s really disappointing not to be able to take this over the finish line, especially with just a year left on the grant,” said Gardner. “We would have been able to do a tremendous amount with that.”

In a statement about the grant cancellations, New York Governor Kathy Hochul said “These cuts directly impact local businesses and major companies, putting workers out of jobs, shuttering factories, and slowing our state’s economic progress.”

In response to questions from Inside Climate News, Ken Lovett, Hochul’s senior communications advisor on energy and environment, wrote that the announcement “came as no surprise given the Trump administration’s full-on assault on clean energy.”

The Trump Administration announced the termination of 321 grants on October 2. An Inside Climate News analysis of federal government spending data for the awards found that only 188 were still active, according to their stated end dates, at the end of September.

Once ICN subtracted money already sent to recipients from the sums obligated to be spent, we calculated a total of $4.87 billion in cuts, roughly two-thirds of the dollar amount announced by the Department of Energy.

For recipients based in New York state, 20 awards were still active when the Trump administration announced the cuts. After accounting for the money already distributed, the state lost out on about $146 million.

But for Hochul, the grant cuts seem to be just the latest setback to her plans to deliver on the state’s lofty climate goals and address energy concerns. She has recently admitted that New York is unlikely to meet its climate targets, drawing the ire of many residents.

Hochul says she remains committed to reducing emissions in the state and has invested considerable funds toward that goal. She recently allocated $1 billion to clean energy projects and emission-reduction efforts and has directed the state-owned utility, the New York Power Authority, to build at least one new nuclear plant by 2040.

Hochul’s Predicament

At a Brooklyn church in early September, the advocacy group Public Power NY hosted a People’s Hearing for Public Renewables, where officials, environmentalists and a few dozen New York residents discussed the state’s renewable energy plans and expressed disappointment with Hochul’s progress.

“We have a movement behind us that is fighting for something better,” said state senator Jabari Brisport, who represents a district in Brooklyn. “We have a governor who wants to drag her feet.”

New York’s Climate Act requires the state to achieve a 40 percent reduction from 1990 levels in economy-wide greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and an 85 percent reduction by 2050. The act also requires that 70 percent of the state’s electricity come from renewable sources by 2030.

Residents were advocating for the New York Power Authority to build 15 gigawatts of renewable energy by 2030, which they view as necessary to meet the state’s goal of net-zero emissions from the electricity grid by 2040. Currently, the utility plans to build 7 gigawatts of renewable energy, despite state law requiring it to fill all gaps in electricity generation left by the private sector.

“Hurricane Ida completely destroyed my district,” said former Democratic U.S. Rep. Jamaal Bowman, whose district included White Plains and Yonkers. “We need a governor with human-centered leadership… and if not, we need a new governor.”

Much of the focus on achieving these climate goals has been on electrifying building heating and cooling with heat pumps and moving away from gas systems. In 2023, the state passed the All-Electric Building Act, which mandated that most buildings use electric appliances, and the all-electric standard was written into the state building code in July.

The legislation effectively requires most new buildings to be completely electric—so no gas heating or cooking. A similar law was passed in New York City in 2021.

At a recent press conference, Wright, the federal energy secretary, alluded to the “many productive dialogues” he has had with the governor, and said that two proposed gas pipelines, which would pass through the state and which state officials have rejected in the past, were “already planned” and would “lower the cost of heating.”

There has been speculation, fueled by a May post on X by Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum, that Hochul “would move forward on critical pipeline capacity.” The implication was that this was a trade-off for allowing the Empire Wind offshore wind project south of Long Island in the Atlantic Ocean to proceed after the administration halted construction.

Within a month, two previously rejected gas pipelines—the Constitution pipeline and the Northeast Supply Enhancement pipeline, or NESE—entered the regulatory process once again. Hochul has denied that she has made a deal with the White House, but the Trump Administration has said that she “caved” and agreed to allow the pipeline construction, according to Politico’s E&E News.

The Constitution pipeline, which the state rejected in 2016, would run from Pennsylvania’s Marcellus shale fracking sites to upstate New York. The NESE pipeline would extend an existing pipeline, building off the coast of New Jersey and Staten Island to eventually connect with existing pipes in Queens, and add gas infrastructure to Pennsylvania. The state has rejected it three times.

In July, National Grid, the gas utility that serves Staten Island, Long Island and parts of Brooklyn and Queens, added the NESE pipeline to its long-term gas plan as an addendum.

The utility has to file a long-term gas plan as a result of a dispute with former governor Andrew Cuomo. The heart of the 2019 dispute was, ironically, an earlier proposal for the NESE pipeline, which the Department of Environmental Conservation had rejected due to its potential impacts on water quality.

The rejection led to a standoff between the utility and state officials, with National Grid refusing to connect customers to gas lines. The dispute only ended because Cuomo threatened to suspend the utility’s license to operate in the state. In the end, National Grid agreed to periodically file a long-term gas plan for review by the state’s Public Service Commission, which regulates utility rates.

The NESE Pipeline Resurfaces

While reviewing the utility’s plan for the future last month, members of the Public Service Commission found that the NESE project would help the state meet the energy needs of its residents and businesses, particularly in the wake of Winter Storm Elliott in 2022. A report by the Federal Energy Regulator Commission found that some areas of New York were at extreme risk of experiencing gas shutoffs at one point during the storm.

But many New Yorkers were dismayed by the commission’s choice, which has no regulatory authority over the pipeline, but which many believe could signal to the Department of Environmental Conservation that the pipeline is necessary and that it should approve its water permit.

“We are in a week-by-week, hour-by-hour, fight to hold [Hochul] off and keep her from approving this thing,” said Pete Sikora, the climate and inequality campaigns director with New York Communities for Change, about the fight to stop the NESE pipeline.

Several public officials, including Staten Island Borough President Vito Fossella and U.S. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, spoke out against the pipeline, as did the city of New York. Water quality concerns and fears of substantial rate increases abound.

“The governor is willing to put the law off to the side in order to appease fossil fuel interests, big private business interests… and for New York families to foot the bill for that,” said Kim Fraczek, the executive director of Sane Energy, a nonprofit organization that is advocating for the replacement of gas infrastructure with renewable energy. “Our costs will only increase, and that’s for ratepayers and for businesses.”

A report by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, an energy research think tank, estimated that the pipeline would cost $1.25 billion—almost $200 million more than what National Grid had said—due to construction inflation. Even if National Grid’s figures are correct, ratepayers would suffer a substantial monthly increase.

National Grid has predicted that the pipeline will cost ratepayers an additional $7.50 per month if approved. But it has also argued that the pipeline could help lower electricity bills by reducing the price of natural gas, which powers many of the state’s electricity plants.

Hochul is also experiencing pressure from the other side of the aisle. Secretary Chris Wright recently criticized the state’s Climate Act, which requires the state to have a net-zero emissions electricity grid by 2040, calling it “totally nuts.”

“The longer and more aggressively [net-zero] is pursued, the more you elevate your energy prices and impoverish your citizens,” Wright told journalists at the press conference in Long Island earlier this month. “Let’s build more energy infrastructure to drive down the cost of energy here in New York state, across New England and across our country.”

Whether the Climate Act drives the state’s high energy prices remains a subject of debate. A recent Public Service Commission report found that cost recovery for Climate Act measures accounted for anywhere from 5 to 9.5 percent of a residential customer’s monthly electric bill—but consistently 2 percent or less of their gas bill—in 2024.

Another factor contributing to higher rates has been large-scale improvements in gas infrastructure. Last year, residents in downstate New York experienced rate hikes when National Grid began a $5 billion system upgrade, which included replacing “leak-prone” pipes across the region.",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2200914586.jpg,N,,2025-10-15 05:59:11.623634

The Township of Schaumburg, Illinois, a suburb northwest of Chicago, debuted its new fleet of electric paratransit buses at an open house event on Oct. 1.

The Township’s first transit electrification project includes four electric buses, five fast chargers and an intelligent charging management system with remote monitoring.

“Through thoughtful fiscal planning, inter-governmental cooperation and working with EV experts, the Township of Schaumburg is able to keep older adults and people with disabilities independent,” while also reducing the vehicles’ environmental impact, Township Supervisor Timothy Heneghan said in a statement.

Dive Insight:

Electric transit and paratransit fleets have grown in recent years, aided by federal funding for low- or zero-emission transit buses. Such funding through the Federal Transit Administration’s Buses and Bus Facilities and Low or No Emission Bus competitive grant programs has continued under the Trump administration, with a $1.5 billion funding round in May.

The New York Metropolitan Transportation Authority launched a pilot program last year, adding 15 electric vans to its paratransit fleet. The San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency plans to transition its paratransit fleet to be all-electric over 20 years and Pace Suburban Bus, which serves the Chicago region, debuted its first electric paratransit vehicle last year.

But Red Tractor called the watchdog's decision ""fundamentally flawed"" and argued that the scheme's focus was animal welfare not environmental standards.
It said that Red Tractor had failed to provide ""sufficient evidence"" that its farms met ""basic"" environmental laws and had a good environmental outcome to substantiate the claims in the ad.
Jim Mosley, CEO of Red Tractor, told the BBC: ""They believe that we have implied an environmental claim.
When asked if that meant Red Tractor does not know if its farms are complying with environmental law, he said: ""Correct"".","A TV advert by Red Tractor, the UK's biggest certifier of farm products on supermarket shelves, has been banned for exaggerating the scheme's environmental benefits and misleading the public.

The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) ruled the organisation had provided ""insufficient evidence"" that its farms complied with basic environmental laws to substantiate the claims in its ad.

Environmental group River Action, which brought the complaint in 2023, said the ruling showed the scheme was ""greenwashing"" and urged supermarkets to stop using it.

But Red Tractor called the watchdog's decision ""fundamentally flawed"" and argued that the scheme's focus was animal welfare not environmental standards.

The environmental charity River Action took issue with the ad, which ran for a further two years, and complained to the watchdog that it suggested to consumers that Red Tractor farms will ""ensure a high degree of environmental protection"".

The charity pointed to a report by the Environment Agency, released in 2020, which looked at how many breaches of environmental law there were on Red Tractor farms in the previous five years. The report concluded that these farms were ""not currently an indicator of good environmental performance"".

After more than two years of investigation - one of the longest running - the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) upheld the complaint.

It said that Red Tractor had failed to provide ""sufficient evidence"" that its farms met ""basic"" environmental laws and had a good environmental outcome to substantiate the claims in the ad.

It also ruled that as a result the advert was ""misleading"" and ""exaggerated"" the benefits of the scheme.

River Action welcomed the decision by the ASA and called on supermarkets to act.

""What this shows is that for their environmental credentials Red Tractor has been misleading the public and their suppliers,"" said Amy Fairman, head of campaigns at River Action. ""So, we're looking for suppliers like supermarkets to really examine and take stock of what is on their shelves.""

She added that challenging such adverts was important because of the risk to the environment from agricultural pollution.

In 2022, the Environment Audit Committee concluded that agriculture was one of the most common factors preventing rivers from being in good health - affecting 40% of them. The risks to the environment include from slurry and pesticide runoff.

But Red Tractor, which assures 45,000 farms in the UK, have pushed back strongly, calling the finding by the ASA ""fundamentally flawed"".

Jim Mosley, CEO of Red Tractor, told the BBC: ""They believe that we have implied an environmental claim. Nowhere in the voiceover or the imagery is any environmental claim actually made.""

He argued that the ASA only found a minority of people would think the advert meant Red Tractor farms had good environmental standards, and in fact the scheme is focused on other issues.

""Red Tractor's core purpose is food safety, animal welfare, and traceability. Whilst we have some environmental standards, they are a small part. And as a consequence, we leave that entirely to the Environment Agency to enforce environmental legislation,"" said Mr Moseley.

This funding will lead to the creation and manufacturing of five new models by 2029, with upgrades to plants in Illinois, Ohio, Michigan, and Indiana. The initiative also includes launching a new four-cylinder engine and reopening the Belvidere Assembly Plant in Illinois, enabling increased output of the Jeep Cherokee and Jeep Compass for American consumers. Altogether, the plan is expected to generate over 5,000 new jobs.

In contrast to earlier multibillion-dollar commitments, this investment is not centered on electric vehicles.

Among the five upcoming vehicles, one will be a range-extended electric model — combining a battery with a gasoline generator for longer driving range — set to be built at the Warren Truck Assembly Plant in Michigan starting in 2028. Stellantis also intends to manufacture a large, new gasoline-powered SUV at the same facility.

Other planned products include the next-generation Dodge Durango, which will be assembled at the Detroit Assembly Complex in 2029; a new midsize pickup truck to be produced at the Toledo Assembly Complex in Ohio; and a brand-new four-cylinder engine, the GMET4 EVO, scheduled for production at the Kokomo, Indiana, plant beginning in 2026.

Second, lawmakers should pass state-level community reinvestment acts to require insurance companies to invest in climate risk reduction and resiliency.
It is time for insurance companies to become part of the solution rather than part of the problem.
As we foresee a new cycle of neighborhood decline driven by bluelining, we must apply time-proven policy tools to insurance companies.","Escalating climate risks and natural disasters, as well as insurance companies’ opportunism, are causing upheaval in the homeowners’ insurance market, leading to a crisis in availability and affordability, and a new wave of exclusion called “bluelining.” That’s when financial institutions like banks, credit facilities, and insurance companies steeply increase prices or withdraw services from communities that have high levels of environmental risk.

Unlike historical redlining, where lenders denied financial services to people who lived in predominately Black neighborhoods, the geographic exclusion of bluelining is not directly based on race. However, bluelining is often happening in the footprints of redlining. If left unchecked, it could replicate old patterns of disinvestment and decline in communities that already are most socially vulnerable and have limited resources to cope with ever-increasing disasters like fires, flooding, and other extreme weather.

At the Consumer Federation of America and The Greenlining Institute, we have worked for decades to improve oversight of financial institutions like insurance companies, and mitigate the harms caused by redlining. We are sounding the alarm on this new frontier of climate-driven financial exclusion and offering a few policy tools to better respond to it.

The Emergence of Bluelining

People who live in formerly redlined neighborhoods are disproportionately Black and Hispanic. Because of decades-long inequitable access to capital and resources, many redlined communities also have an older, more vulnerable housing stock, and greater exposure to environmental and natural disaster risk. These formerly redlined neighborhoods face higher climate risk due to proximity to hazardous industrial sites, less tree canopy, and an overall underinvestment from both public and private actors in resilient infrastructure, leaving them especially vulnerable to climate-driven financial discrimination.

As a result, bluelining has the potential to exacerbate disinvestment. It leaves communities that have long been denied adequate investment—communities that are now bearing the brunt of climate impacts—without the financial resources to withstand and recover from storms and other weather-related events.

Insurance companies are at the forefront of bluelining today, effectively making determinations about which communities remain insurable and have a future and which communities will not. Without insurance, it is impossible to get a mortgage, and when people can’t get mortgages, the value of homes in that neighborhood plummet.

But bluelining also has implications beyond the availability of property insurance. When insurance coverage is insufficient, mortgage lenders and securitizers—notably Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac, which hold the credit risk of most U.S. mortgages—are exposed. And while insurance companies may be the first to begin withdrawing from climate-vulnerable areas, other financial institutions are starting to follow in deciding where to originate a mortgage or loan, and at what price.

This risk is finally being recognized at the highest levels. In February, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell testified in front of the Senate banking committee in reference to high-risk communities. “If you fast forward 10 or 15 years, there are going to be regions of the country where you can’t get a mortgage. There won’t be ATMs. You know, the banks won’t have branches and things like that,” Powell said.

As insurance companies and lenders increasingly factor climate risk into their business strategies, communities may witness a resurgence of racial and economic exclusion that mimics redlining practices. And as this financial and climate ripple effect intensifies, we may see a new cycle of neighborhood decline.

How Bluelining Will Shape Neighborhood Decline

Bluelining not only makes it hard for individual households to get insurance; it affects entire communities. In the highest-risk communities with the most expensive insurance premiums and lowest level of insurance availability, more and more homeowners are going underinsured and uninsured. An analysis of 2021 American Housing Survey data from the US Census Bureau shows that 1 in 13 homeowners in the United States are uninsured. Homeowners of color are disproportionately at risk.

Those without insurance are at risk of losing their homes and possessions in just one storm or disaster. Over time, this means that neighborhoods with many uninsured homes will have more vacant housing or housing in disrepair. The lessons from depopulated cities show us thatthis vacancy often leads to a downward spiral in surrounding property value and undermines the local tax base. As a 1968 Congressional report concluded, “Communities without insurance are communities without hope.”

When companies blueline communities and restrict access to insurance and mortgages, more residents and businesses may be forced to leave, accelerating a cycle of depopulation. While the last century saw suburbanization, this one may be defined by climate migration, as people flee vulnerable areas for safer ground. Amid this mass exit, the families left behind will be those with the fewest financial resources to move. They’ll be forced to live with crumbling infrastructure and dwindling support.

Without proactive, equitable climate and insurance policy, these trends could mirror and extend the legacies of redlining—deepening racial and economic disparities.

Fighting Back

If these trends become the norm, the challenges of housing disinvestment, shrinking tax bases, and unavailability of financial services are likely to reemerge in climate-impacted places. To prevent this, policymakers must ensure that communities, especially historically marginalized communities, are not left without protection, resources, or a voice in shaping their futures.

As history risks repeating itself, we can start to meet this moment by retooling policies first developed in response to redlining and apply them to the insurance industry.

First, insurance companies should be required to annually disclose their pricing, underwriting, denials, and claim payouts in every census tract, akin to what the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act requires financial institutions to do. There is a severe lack of publicly available data on insurance access and pricing. While laudable efforts in the recent past by the Federal Insurance Office and the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee have aimed to close this gap, they have not led to consistent and robust transparency into property insurance.

By contrast, to prevent redlining, since 1975 mortgage lenders have been required to annually disclose data on every mortgage application they receive. This has provided critical transparency and accountability of the mortgage industry and allowed regulators and the public to detect potential discrimination before it takes hold. As homeowners’ insurance increasingly determines who can own a home and where, insurers should be required to report homeowners’ insurance data in the same manner as mortgage lenders. Such transparency can help prevent unfair discrimination in pricing and access, both between different communities and within communities, where it is targeted at the most vulnerable homeowners. State insurance commissioners should work alongside the Federal Insurance Office to enforce and coordinate this data collection and distribution.

Second, lawmakers should pass state-level community reinvestment acts to require insurance companies to invest in climate risk reduction and resiliency. Examples like California’s Organized Investment Network and the 25-year-old Massachusetts Insurance Company Community Investment Initiative offer voluntary frameworks for directing insurer investments into environmental, housing, and other underfunded needs.

States should launch these kinds of initiatives to ensure that insurance companies become partners in reducing risk and safeguarding communities, rather than only being in the business of profiting from risk. Indeed, insurance companies have extensive investment portfolios, which are a key contributor to their financial bottom line, but many of their investments are exacerbating climate change and driving up costs for communities and homeowners. It is time for insurance companies to become part of the solution rather than part of the problem. With appropriate oversight, state-level community reinvestment acts can drive much-needed investment dollars into resilient communities and housing, while helping lower overall risk and ultimately, the premiums homeowners must pay.

As we foresee a new cycle of neighborhood decline driven by bluelining, we must apply time-proven policy tools to insurance companies. Insurance companies must be held accountable to where and with whom they do business—their decisions increasingly drive the future of homeowners and communities—and must also become investment partners in risk reduction. To prevent bluelining, transparency and investment are critical first steps.",https://shelterforce.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Insurance-Map.jpg,N,,2025-10-15 07:02:21.257544

This issue was raised during the thematic session “Maximising the Economic and Social Benefits of the Electric Vehicle Transition” at the Indonesia International Sustainability Forum (IISF) 2025 on Saturday, October 11.

“The transition to electric vehicles is not only an environmental agenda, but also one of economic independence for the nation.","Jakarta – The transition to electric vehicles (EVs) is increasingly seen as the golden key for Indonesia in realising a green economy. Not only does it have the potential to reduce carbon emissions, but the electrification of transportation is also believed to create hundreds of thousands of new jobs and ease the burden of national energy subsidies.

This issue was raised during the thematic session “Maximising the Economic and Social Benefits of the Electric Vehicle Transition” at the Indonesia International Sustainability Forum (IISF) 2025 on Saturday, October 11. The forum highlighted that the transition to electric vehicles is not merely a matter of technology, but also an interconnected economic, social, and fiscal strategy.

“Transportation electrification is the path to an efficient, independent, and low-emission energy system. Its impact is not only on reducing pollution, but also on fiscal efficiency through savings in fuel subsidies and the creation of green jobs,” said Ahmad Faisal Suralaga, Director of Downstream Strategy and Governance at the Ministry of Investment/BKPM.

Promote fiscal reform and energy efficiency

According to Faisal, downstreaming in the electric vehicle sector is now seen not only as an increase in export value but also as a creator of a sustainable industrial ecosystem. To date, more than 10,000 workers have been absorbed by ongoing downstreaming projects.

Meanwhile, Head of the Center for Industry, Trade, and Investment at INDEF, Andry Satrio Nugroho, believes that fiscal policy plays a vital role in accelerating the adoption of electric vehicles. One instrument that is considered adequate is the application of emission taxes, which can cover up to 111 per cent of potential state revenue losses due to EV incentives.

“With the emissions tax scheme, high-pollution vehicles are subject to disincentives, while low-emission vehicles are not burdened. This is not only fair, but also fiscally efficient,” said Andry.

INDEF analysis notes that the burden of energy subsidies and compensation for fossil fuel vehicles reaches Rp308 trillion per year, which is far greater than the potential loss of state revenue from electric vehicle incentives, estimated at only around Rp14.7 trillion.

Deputy Coordinator of the Secretariat for the National Energy Downstreaming and Security Acceleration Task Force, Dimas Muhamad, said that the success of the EV transition must rely on human innovation, not solely on natural resources.

A similar view was expressed by Gonggomtua Sitanggang, Director of the Southeast Asia Institute for Transportation and Development Policy (ITDP), who emphasised the economic benefits of electrifying public transportation.

According to him, the use of electric buses can save up to 30 per cent in operational costs, reduce residents’ mobility costs, and expand the reach of transportation services. “The ITDP study shows that the benefit-cost ratio (BCR) of public transportation electrification in Jakarta can reach 2.4. This means that every Rp1 invested generates Rp2.4 in economic and social benefits,” said Gonggomtua.

From an industry perspective, R Hanggoro Ananta from the Indonesian Electric Motorcycle Industry Association (AISMOLI) said that the transition to EVs will open up significant job opportunities in the manufacturing, conversion, and technology research sectors. Currently, AISMOLI oversees 57 member companies that are active in various lines of the electric vehicle industry. With the increasing adoption of EVs nationally, this sector is projected to create more than 150,000 new jobs by 2030.

“The transition to electric vehicles is not only an environmental agenda, but also one of economic independence for the nation. This is an opportunity to produce thousands of technicians and green workers who are ready to face the era of sustainable industry,” said Hanggoro. (Hartatik)

The project will cost nearly $100 million for retooling and add more than 900 jobs at the plant in suburban Detroit, which currently assembles the Jeep Wagoneer and Grand Wagoneer.
“As part of this announcement, we will move one model from Canada to the U.S.,” a Stellantis spokesperson said.
“Canadian auto jobs are being sacrificed on the Trump altar,” Unifor President Lana Payne said in a statement.
Stellantis said it would add 900 jobs in Toledo to make the truck there, and it plans to continue with investments in Toledo that it announced previously.","In Michigan, the Warren Truck Assembly Plant will make a new SUV, available as either a range-extended electric vehicle or a gasoline-powered model, starting in 2028, Stellantis said. The project will cost nearly $100 million for retooling and add more than 900 jobs at the plant in suburban Detroit, which currently assembles the Jeep Wagoneer and Grand Wagoneer.

Stellantis also plans to invest $130 million to prepare the Detroit Assembly Complex – Jefferson plant for production of the next-generation Dodge Durango, reaffirming a commitment from January. Production of that vehicle is anticipated to launch in 2029. The UAW previously had expressed concern that Durango production would leave the U.S.

“This investment in the U.S. — the single largest in the Company’s history — will drive our growth, strengthen our manufacturing footprint and bring more American jobs to the states we call home,” Stellantis CEO Antonio Filosa said in a statement. “As we begin our next 100 years, we are putting the customer at the center of our strategy, expanding our vehicle offerings and giving them the freedom to choose the products they want and love.”

Stellantis said it plans to reopen an Illinois assembly plant in in 2027, affirming an earlier commitment to do so. But instead of building a midsize Ram pickup, the plant, which has been offline since 2023, will make the Jeep Compass and Cherokee that were slated to be built outside the U.S.

The Ram pickup now will be assembled in Toledo, Ohio, starting in 2028.

“A year ago, Stellantis was on a fast-track to moving their U.S. operations out of the country,” UAW President Shawn Fain said in a statement. “Their decision today proves that targeted auto tariffs can, in fact, bring back thousands of good union jobs to the U.S. Wall Street and supposed industry experts said this was impossible. But race to the bottom created by free trade is finally coming to an end.”

Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said in a statement celebrating the Michigan investment, ""Over the last few years, Stellantis has expanded in Michigan, and we will continue working with them to make it easier to manufacture in Michigan by investing in workforce development, cutting red tape, incentivizing R&D, and increasing government efficiency.""

The news follows General Motors’ commitment in June to spend $4 billion to increase U.S. manufacturing.

Stellantis’ $13 billion total includes R&D spending and supplier costs. After Filosa became CEO in June, he set a “clear priority” for his team to grow the company in the U.S., where sales and profits had been declining.

“The only way we know to consistently grow in such a competitive market is to launch the right product with the right brands, the right tech and the right powertrain,” Filosa said. “So how we do that? First, we decided to put our customer at the center of everything we do. We actually started listening to him and her and to engage a lot our dealers. That’s how we came out with our growing plan.”

The product launches announced Oct. 14 “will be in addition to a regular cadence of 19 refreshed products across all U.S. assembly plants and updated powertrains planned through 2029,” Stellantis said.

The company plans to invest $600 million to reopen the Belvidere Assembly Plant in Illinois to produce the Cherokee and Compass for the U.S., with one nameplate starting in 2027 and the other in 2028. This will create about 3,300 new jobs.

Both nameplates were previously made in Belvidere, with the Compass moving to Mexico in 2016 and the Cherokee being discontinued when the plant was idled in 2023.

Jeep is reviving the Cherokee this fall as a hybrid built in Mexico.

When Belvidere reopens, Filosa said it will be the primary source of Cherokees and Compasses for the U.S. Stellantis no longer plans to make the redesigned Compass in Brampton, Ontario, after halting work to retool the Canadian plant in February.

“As part of this announcement, we will move one model from Canada to the U.S.,” a Stellantis spokesperson said. “We have been in Canada for over 100 years, and we are investing there. We are adding a third shift to the Windsor Assembly Plant to support increased demand of all versions of the Chrysler Pacifica and the new Sixpack-powered Dodge Charger Scat Pack and R/T models. Canada is very important to us. We have plans for Brampton and will share them upon further discussions with the Canadian government.”

The move upset the Canadian auto union Unifor, which urged the government to help ensure jobs at the Brampton plant are not lost.

“Canadian auto jobs are being sacrificed on the Trump altar,” Unifor President Lana Payne said in a statement. “Stellantis cannot be allowed to renege on its commitments to Canadian workers, and governments cannot stand by while our jobs are shifted to the United States. Saving Brampton Assembly must now be this country’s top priority, sending a strong message to any corporation thinking they can take the same egregious actions.”

Nearly $400 million is going toward assembly of the new midsize pickup in Ohio, joining the Jeep Wrangler and Gladiator. Stellantis said it would add 900 jobs in Toledo to make the truck there, and it plans to continue with investments in Toledo that it announced previously.

Stellantis also confirmed a January announcement to make upgrades at several Kokomo, Ind., plants for a new four-cylinder engine to be made starting in 2026. The automaker said it will add more than 100 jobs and invest more than $100 million “to ensure that the U.S. will be the manufacturing home of this strategic powertrain.”

“This is a phenomenal testament to the recent work that has been done to strengthen the company’s relationship with dealers, while strengthening its overall presence in U.S. sales and production,” said Michael Bettenhausen, chairman of the Stellantis National Dealer Council.",https://s3-rd-prod.crainsdetroit.com/styles/1200x630/s3/SSTELLANTIS-MAIN_i_6_0.jpg,N,,2025-10-15 03:00:13.637579

Western North Carolina is home to a number of working writers; stop by one (or more!)","In September 2024, Hurricane Helene devastated Western North Carolina. The storm’s high winds barreled into the southern Appalachians on the heels of a thousand-year rain event. The French Broad River — which normally runs through Asheville at about half a foot — swelled to a staggering 27 feet. Hurricane-force winds tore down trees, and much of the area was without power and other basic utilities for weeks. A year later and haunting evidence of the storm still lingers.

Asheville, like much of the region, has struggled to rebound. This summer, hotel lodging demand was down about 10% from the same time last year. Employment in the hospitality industry is down by about the same amount. Tourist attractions like Chimney Rock State Park shuttered for repairs, and restaurants have struggled to turn a profit as visitors have stayed away.

But Asheville is climbing back. Trails are clear, shops and attractions are open again, and the music and food scenes hum with Asheville’s singular energy. Whether you’re passing through or planning a long weekend, you can spend in good conscience as you help a mountain city get back on its feet.

Farms and Markets

On Saturday morning, head to the University of North Carolina at Asheville campus for the North Asheville Tailgate Market, a producer-only farmers market with more than 70 vendors each week. Upwards of 80% of the market vendors earn their living from the crafts and products they make and sell. Budget plenty of time to sample vegan and dairy cheeses, browse native plants, and gawk at the vegetable bounty. Look out for Black Trumpet Farm’s dazzling mushrooms, Asheville Tea Company’s local blends, and Conjure Craft Chocolate’s gift-worthy bars.

The River Arts District, once full of galleries, shops, bars, and restaurants on the banks of the French Broad, was among the neighborhoods Helene damaged most. The River Arts District Farmers Market, in operation for more than two decades, has since relocated to New Belgium Brewing, where, on Wednesday afternoons from 3 to 6 p.m., you can shop from more than 30 local craftspeople and farmers who grow what they sell. East, West, and downtown Asheville, as well as neighboring towns Black Mountain, Weaverville, and Enka-Candler, also host tailgate markets with local producers. If market days don’t line up with your stay, browse the WNC Farmers Market, a vast emporium open daily, for local relishes, pickles, seasonal produce, fudge, and baked goods.

Restaurants and Chefs

Stop by Chef Meherwan Irani’s Indian street-food restaurant Chai Pani, which won a James Beard Award for Outstanding Restaurant in 2022, and don’t miss the vegetarian kale pakora chaat. Another Beard award winner, Chef Katie Button’s downtown restaurant Cúrate, whose name means “heal yourself,” has been serving Spanish tapas and curated wines for more than a decade. Chef Silver Iocovozzi and his husband, Cherry Iocovozzi, opened Neng Jr.’s in 2022. In short order, the Filipino restaurant earned Best New Restaurant nods from Bon Appétit, Esquire, and The New York Times. Make a reservation as soon as you can; the cozy, intimate space has only 18 seats.

Another 18-seat restaurant making waves well beyond city limits? Good Hot Fish, Chef Ashleigh Shanti’s modern fish camp, serves fish sandwiches, shrimp burgers, and “trout bologna and cheese” in the South Slope Brewing District. Make it part of a brewery-hopping tour of the neighborhood. There are several within walking distance, including Burial Beer Co. and The Funkatorium, which showcases sour beers. Nearby Antidote Cocktail Lounge is worth a visit, too ( Here’s a video on how to mix their “Savory Sailor” cocktail at home.). Find more funky flavors at Anoche, with its extensive collection of tequila and its sultry, smoky cousin, mezcal.

Ali Casparian, the executive director of Bounty & Soul, a local food justice organization, recommends restaurants and food businesses that prioritize local sourcing, sustainability, and community care. A few favorite restaurants include Posana, for its seasonal, locally sourced menu and commitment to sustainability; Chestnut, which has led Asheville’s composting and local food movement since the early 2000s; and The Blackbird, where modern Southern dishes highlight the Carolinas’ seasonal bounty. These spots, Casparian says, “reflect the values of our region.”

Venture about 20 minutes east of Asheville to Black Mountain to try South African cuisine at Bush Farmhouse, whose menu features produce grown on site, and Annie’s Cafe & Produce, a garden-to-table restaurant that has doubled as a relief kitchen after local disasters like Helene. (Read more about Annie’s efforts after Helene here.) The menu offers plenty of vegan and vegetarian options. Another destination worth the drive is Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.’s Mills River Taproom, about 20 minutes south of downtown Asheville. The sprawling brewery, set along a river, is a Disneyland for hopheads. A stage hosts local and touring acts, and the restaurant serves modern American cuisine and bar bites. Enjoy seasonal and year-round brews while you walk around the vegetable garden and admire hops vining on trellises, or in an Adirondack chair with a lush forest view.

Back in town, other consistently good standbys include Mehfil for Indian food; El Que Pasa, an unassuming strip-mall joint for Mexican; Tall John’s, a neighborhood tavern in the historic Montford area; and plant, a vegan bistro fit for special occasions.

Coffee and Tea

Stop into one of Dobrá Tea’s two locations for a midafternoon pick-me-up that doubles as an experience itself. Slip off your shoes and settle onto a cushion before you browse a thick menu of loose-leaf tea varieties from all over the world. Enjoy a vegan (or non-vegan) treat and linger over a pot of tea as you take in the tea house ambiance.

Asheville has no shortage of coffee shops. Three of the best are Rowan Coffee, with two artfully designed locations downtown and in West Asheville; Pollen Coffee + Flower Shop, where you can order a latte along with a bouquet of fresh blooms; and Farewell, which serves wine and light bites in addition to coffee-shop classics.

Things to Do and Places to Be

Asheville has a famously vibrant music scene. Look for local bands like Empire Strikes Brass and The Get Right Band gigging around town, or catch a show at The Grey Eagle, The Orange Peel, or Asheville Yards. (Check livemusicasheville.com for daily show listings.)

Attend an author event or just browse at Malaprop’s, one of the South’s best independent bookstores. Don’t miss the cookbook section, which has beautifully designed new releases, including vegetarian and vegan books. For curated used and local books, stop in at West Asheville’s Bagatelle Books, then get another physical-media fix across the street at Harvest Records.

Shop for secondhand outdoor gear at Second Gear, which relocated after Helene flooded its riverside space, then put your finds to good use in the mountains that surround the city. Walk the trails and check out a fascinating bonsai display at the North Carolina Arboretum, then joyride and take in stunning vistas on the nearby Blue Ridge Parkway. Chase waterfalls: Looking Glass Falls,Triple Falls, and Skinny Dip Falls are popular options, but get off the beaten track and you’ll likely discover waterfalls of your own.

Local Books

The city of Asheville and the spooky, atmospheric ambiance of the Southern Appalachians have inspired writers for generations. Thomas Wolfe, one of the city’s most famous literary sons, wrote the 1929 classic Look Homeward, Angel based on his own coming of age. William R. Forstchen’s One Second After is a terrifying post-apocalyptic thriller about a man trying to save his family after a terrorist attack sends his small North Carolina town back to a dark age. Ron Rash’s story collection Nothing Gold Can Stay spans from the Civil War to the present day and all the stories are set in Appalachia. His novel Serena tells the story of a newlywed couple who set out to build a timber empire in the area in 1929; the effort and their relationship bring shocking, violent twists. Wilma Dykeman’s 1955 nonfiction book The French Broad profiles the eponymous river, and Denise Kiernan’s The Last Castle dives into the sprawling Biltmore Estate and its effect on the city. Annette Clapsaddle is the first member of the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians to publish a novel; her 2020 book, Even as We Breathe, follows a Cherokee man as he leaves his people on the Qualla Boundary in 1942 and seeks a job at Asheville’s glamorous Grove Park Inn. Western North Carolina is home to a number of working writers; stop by one (or more!) of Asheville’s several independent bookshops and ask the booksellers for their latest recommendations.",https://bluedotliving.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ASHEVILLE-fall-color-milepost-399-02-JaredKay-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-10-15 07:02:56.191655

The promise of new engineering techniques for geothermal energy — heat from the Earth itself — has attracted rising levels of investment to this reliable, low-emission power source that can provide continuous electricity almost anywhere on the planet. That includes ways to harness geothermal energy from idle or abandoned oil and gas wells. In the first quarter of 2025, North American geothermal installations attracted $1.7 billion in public funding — compared with $2 billion for all of 2024, which itself was a significant increase from previous years, according to an industry analysis from consulting firm Wood Mackenzie.

As an exploration geophysicist and energy engineer, I’ve studied geothermal systems’ resource potential and operational trade-offs firsthand. From the investment and technological advances I’m seeing, I believe geothermal energy is poised to become a significant contributor to the energy mix in the U.S. and around the world, especially when integrated with other renewable sources.

A May 2025 assessment by the U.S. Geological Survey found that geothermal sources just in the Great Basin, a region that encompasses Nevada and parts of neighboring states, have the potential to meet as much as 10 percent of the electricity demand of the whole nation — and even more as technology to harness geothermal energy advances. And the International Energy Agency estimates that by 2050, geothermal energy could provide as much as 15 percent of the world’s electricity needs.

Geothermal energy taps into heat beneath the Earth’s surface to generate electricity or provide direct heating. Unlike solar or wind, it never stops. It runs around the clock, providing consistent, reliable power with closed-loop water systems and few emissions.

Geothermal is capable of providing significant quantities of energy. For instance, Fervo Energy’s Cape Station project in Utah is reportedly on track to deliver 100 megawatts of baseload, carbon-free geothermal power by 2026. That’s less than the amount of power generated by the average coal plant in the U.S., but more than the average natural gas plant produces.

But the project, estimated to cost $1.1 billion, is not complete. When complete in 2028, the station is projected to deliver 500 megawatts of electricity. That amount is 100 megawatts more than its original goal without additional drilling, thanks to various technical improvements since the project broke ground.

And geothermal energy is becoming economically competitive. By 2035, according to the International Energy Agency, technical advances could mean energy from enhanced geothermal systems could cost as little as $50 per megawatt-hour, a price competitive with other renewable sources.

Types of Geothermal Energy

There are several ways to get energy from deep within the Earth.

Hydrothermal systems tap into underground hot water and steam to generate electricity. These resources are concentrated in geologically active areas where heat, water and permeable rock naturally coincide. In the U.S., that’s generally California, Nevada and Utah. Internationally, most hydrothermal energy is in Iceland and the Philippines.

Some hydrothermal facilities, such as Larderello in Italy, have operated for over a century, proving the technology’s long-term viability. Others in New Zealand and the U.S. have been running since the late 1950s and early 1960s.

Enhanced geothermal systems effectively create electricity-generating hydrothermal processes just about anywhere on the planet. In places where there is not enough water in the ground or where the rock is too dense to move heat naturally, these installations drill deep holes and inject fluid into the hot rocks, creating new fractures and opening existing ones, much like hydraulic fracturing for oil and gas production.

A system like this uses more than one well. In one, it pumps cold water down, which collects heat from the rocks and then is pumped back up through another well, where the heat drives turbines. In recent years, academic and corporate research has dramatically improved drilling speed and lowered costs.

Ground source heat pumps do not require drilling holes as deep, but instead take advantage of the fact that the Earth’s temperature is relatively stable just below the surface, even just six or eight feet down — and it’s hotter hundreds of feet lower.

These systems don’t generate electricity but rather circulate fluid in underground pipes, exchanging heat with the soil, extracting warmth from the ground in winter and transferring warmth to the ground in summer. These systems are similar but more efficient than air-source heat pumps, sometimes called minisplits, which are becoming widespread across the U.S. for heating and cooling. Geothermal heat pump systems can serve individual homes, commercial buildings and even neighborhood or business developments.

Direct-use applications also don’t generate electricity but rather use the geothermal heat directly. Farmers heat greenhouses and dry crops; aquaculture facilities maintain optimal water temperatures; industrial operations use the heat to dehydrate food, cure concrete or other energy-intensive processes. Worldwide, these applications now deliver over 100,000 megawatts of thermal capacity. Some geothermal fluids contain valuable minerals; lithium concentrations in the groundwater of California’s Salton Sea region could potentially supply battery manufacturers. Federal judges are reviewing a proposal to do just that, as well as legal challenges to it.

Researchers are also finding new ways to use geothermal resources. Some are using underground rock formations to store energy as heat when consumer demand is low and use it to produce electricity when demand rises.

Some geothermal power stations can adjust their output to meet demand, rather than running continuously at maximum capacity.

Geothermal sources are also making other renewable-energy projects more effective. Pairing geothermal energy with solar and wind resources and battery storage are increasing the reliability of above-ground renewable power in Texas, among other places.

And geothermal energy can power clean hydrogen production as well as energy-intensive efforts to physically remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, as is happening in Iceland.

Geothermal Potential in the U.S. and Worldwide

Currently, the U.S. has about 3.9 gigawatts of installed geothermal capacity, mostly in the West. That’s about 0.4 percent of current U.S. energy production, but the amount of available energy is much larger, according to federal and international engineering assessments.

And converting abandoned oil and gas wells for enhanced geothermal systems could significantly increase the amount of energy available and its geographic spread.

One example is happening in Beaver County, in the southwestern part of Utah. Once a struggling rural community, it now hosts multiple geothermal plants that are being developed to both demonstrate the potential and to supply electricity to customers as far away as California.

Those projects include repurposing idle oil or gas wells, which is relatively straightforward: Engineers identify wells that reach deep, hot rock formations and circulate water or another fluid in a closed loop to capture heat to generate electricity or provide direct heating. This method does not require drilling new wells, which significantly reduces setup costs and environmental disruption and accelerates deployment.

There are as many as 4 million abandoned oil and gas wells across the U.S., some of which could shift from being fossil fuel infrastructure into opportunities for clean energy.

Challenges and Trade-offs

Geothermal energy is not without technical, environmental and economic hurdles.

Drilling is expensive, and conventional systems need specific geological conditions. Enhanced systems, using hydraulic fracturing, risk causing earthquakes.

Overall emissions are low from geothermal systems, though the systems can release hydrogen sulfide, a corrosive gas that is toxic to humans and can contribute to respiratory irritation. But modern geothermal plants use abatement systems that can capture up to 99.9 percent of hydrogen sulfide before it enters the atmosphere. And the systems do use water, though closed-loop systems can minimize consumption.

Building geothermal power stations does require significant investment, but its ability to deliver energy over the long term can offset many of these costs. Projects like those undertaken by Fervo Energy show that government subsidies are no longer necessary for a project to get funded, built and begin generating energy.

Despite its challenges, geothermal energy’s reliability, low emissions and scalability make it a vital complement to solar and wind — and a cornerstone of a stable, low-carbon energy future.
