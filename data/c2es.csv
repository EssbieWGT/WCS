To Lewis, coauthor of the Industrious Labs report, that’s a weak excuse, because hydrogen production by other companies would have ramped up to supply the facility.
Meanwhile, Cliffs’ Cleveland Works continues to spew emissions that drive climate change and harm human health.
Industrious Labs’ report notes the unit’s lining is nearing the end of its useful life.
Cleveland Works also leverages much of the waste heat from its industrial activities to make electricity.","Cleveland has big ambitions to reduce its planet-warming emissions. But a massive steelmaking facility run by Cleveland-Cliffs, one of Ohio’s major employers, could make it difficult for the city to see those plans through.

The plant emits roughly 4.2 million metric tons of greenhouse gases each year, complicating Cleveland’s effort to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, according to a report released by advocacy group Industrious Labs this summer. The plant is the city’s largest single source of planet-warming pollution.

Cleveland’s climate action plan is ​“bold and achievable,” said Hilary Lewis, steel director for Industrious Labs. But ​“if they want to achieve those goals, they have to take action on this Cleveland Works facility.”

As a major investment decision looms over an aging blast furnace at the facility, it’s unclear whether the company will move to cut its direct greenhouse gas emissions — or opt to reinvest in its existing coal-dependent processes.

Cliffs’ progress in reducing its nationwide emissions earned it recognition as a 2023 Goal Achiever in the Department of Energy’s Better Climate Challenge. As this year began, the company was set to slash emissions even further through projects supported by Biden-era legislation — the Inflation Reduction Act and the 2021 infrastructure law.

Then the Trump administration commenced its monthslong campaign of reneging on funding commitments for clean energy projects, including ones meant to ramp up the production of ​“green” hydrogen made with renewable energy. In June, Cliffs’ CEO Lourenco Goncalves backed away from a federally funded project to convert its Middletown Works in southwestern Ohio to produce green steel, saying there wouldn’t be a sufficient supply of hydrogen for the plant.

To Lewis, coauthor of the Industrious Labs report, that’s a weak excuse, because hydrogen production by other companies would have ramped up to supply the facility. “[Cliffs was] going to need so much hydrogen that they would be creating the demand,” she said.

Meanwhile, Cliffs’ Cleveland Works continues to spew emissions that drive climate change and harm human health. Industrious Labs’ modeling estimates that pollution from Cleveland Works is responsible for up to 39 early deaths per year, more than 1,700 lost work days, and more than 9,000 asthma cases. Cleveland ranks as the country’s fifth-worst city for people with asthma, according to the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America.

A road map for cutting carbon

Cleveland Works’ Blast Furnace #6 is a hulking vessel that removes impurities from iron ore by combining it with limestone and coke, a form of coal that burns at very high temperatures. Industrious Labs’ report notes the unit’s lining is nearing the end of its useful life.

To Industrious Labs, this presents an opportunity: The company could replace the old infrastructure with equipment that can process iron ore with natural gas or hydrogen instead of coal. Investing in this technology, called direct reduction, would cut the plant’s greenhouse gas emissions by more than 30% if natural gas is used. Using green hydrogen would slash emissions even more, the Industrious Labs team found.

The alternative is to just reline the furnace, which was the course Cliffs chose for the Cleveland facility’s Blast Furnace #5 in 2022.

Relining might provide small emissions cuts when measured per ton of steel, due to increased efficiencies, Lewis said. But ramped-up production from running more ore through the furnace could offset those reductions or even increase total emissions.

Cliffs did not respond to Canary Media’s repeated requests for comment for this story, and it has not yet publicly announced its plans for Blast Furnace #6.

To put itself on track with Cleveland’s emissions goals, however, the company would need to do more than just convert Blast Furnace #6 to the direct reduction process, Industrious Labs said.

The next step in the road map the group laid out would be for Cliffs to process refined iron ore into steel with an electric arc furnace — which can run on carbon-free power — instead of using the current basic oxygen equipment. Investing in green-hydrogen-based direct reduction and an electric arc furnace, instead of relining Blast Furnace #6, would increase emissions cuts to 47%, according to the Industrious Labs report.

Later steps would use direct reduction of iron and an electric arc furnace to refine and process the ore that is currently handled by Blast Furnace #5. Completing that work would cut Cleveland Works’ greenhouse gas emissions by 96%, according to the report.

What happens now?

The Industrious Labs analysis appears to lay out a credible decarbonization pathway, although not necessarily the only one, said Jenita McGowan, Cuyahoga County’s deputy chief of sustainability and climate. Cuyahoga County, which includes Cleveland, also has a goal of net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 and is in the process of finalizing the latest version of its climate action plan.

“My question about the paper is how feasible it truly is that Cleveland-Cliffs will deploy it in the near future,” McGowan said. Policy uncertainties at the federal level further complicate matters, she added.

For now, the city and county seem to be taking a pragmatic approach, focusing on achievements to date and encouraging future cuts wherever companies will make them.

But getting to net-zero for the industrial sector ​“will require more fundamental changes … [which] will take place over decades, rather than over a few years,” Cleveland’s climate action plan says. It also notes that low-carbon steel costs 40% more to produce compared to standard methods, ​“making it difficult for steelmakers to justify the investment in clean production.”

Cuyahoga County’s draft climate plan highlights Cliffs’ energy-efficiency improvements, including Cleveland Works’ use of some iron from the firm’s direct reduction plant in Toledo, Ohio. Cleveland Works also leverages much of the waste heat from its industrial activities to make electricity. The facility recently boosted that combined-heat-and-power generation by about 50 megawatts, the plan notes. That replaces electricity the plant would otherwise need from the grid, a majority of which still comes from fossil fuels.

Faster emissions reductions are certainly better, McGowan said. But the county also wants to make sure companies can stay in business as they decarbonize — especially Cliffs, one of the largest sources of commerce at the city’s port.

In Lewis’ view, decarbonizing Cleveland Works earlier rather than later would be a smart business move for Cliffs. ​“I think the biggest thing is staying competitive,” Lewis said.

One of Cliffs’ largest markets is supplying high-quality steel for automobiles, including electric vehicles, she added. In March, Hyundai announced plans to invest $6 billion in a new plant in Ascension Parish, Louisiana, that will produce low-carbon steel. As automakers face global pressure to source cleaner metal, Cliffs could find itself left behind, Lewis suggested.",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/Cleveland-Works.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=13828c7e6c4ea00a78f2116944b9d7bf,N,,2025-09-18 07:59:26.320654

Texas moved first, as state lawmakers try to protect residents in the data-center hotspot from another deadly blackout, like the winter storm in 2021 when dozens died.

Now the concept is emerging in the 13-state mid-Atlantic grid and elsewhere as massive data centers are coming online faster than power plants can be built and connected to grids. That has elicited pushback from data centers and Big Tech, for whom a steady power supply is vital.

Like many other states, Texas wants to attract data centers as an economic boon, but it faces the challenge of meeting the huge volumes of electricity the centers demand. Lawmakers there passed a bill in June that, among other things, orders up standards for power emergencies when utilities must disconnect big electric users.

That, in theory, would save enough electricity to avoid a broad blackout on the handful of days during the year when it is hottest or coldest and power consumption pushes grids to their limits or beyond.

Texas was first, but it won’t be the last, analysts say, now that the late 2022 debut of OpenAI’s ChatGPT ignited worldwide demand for chatbots and other generative AI products that typically require large amounts of computing power to train and operate.

“We’re going to see that kind of thing pop up everywhere,” said Michael Webber, a University of Texas engineering professor who specializes in energy. “Data center flexibility will be expected, required, encouraged, mandated, whatever it is.”

Data centers are threatening grids

That’s because grids can’t keep up with the fast-growing number of data center projects unfolding in Texas and perhaps 20 other states as the U.S. competes in a race against China for artificial intelligence superiority.

Grid operators in Texas, the Great Plains states and the mid-Atlantic region have produced eye-popping projections showing that electricity demand in the coming years will spike, largely due to data centers.

A proposal similar to Texas’ has emerged from the nation’s biggest grid operator, PJM Interconnection, which runs the mid-Atlantic grid that serves 65 million people and data-center hotspots in Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania.

The CEO of the Southwest Power Pool, which operates the grid that serves 18 million people primarily in Kansas, Oklahoma and other Great Plains states, said it has no choice but to expand power-reduction programs — likely for the biggest power users — to meet growing demand.

The proposals are cropping up at a time when electricity bills nationally are rising fast — twice the rate of inflation, according to federal data — and growing evidence suggests that the bills of some regular Americans are rising to subsidize the gargantuan energy needs of Big Tech.

Analysts say power plant construction cannot keep up with the growth of data center demand, and that something must change.

“Data center load has the potential to overwhelm the grid, and I think it is on its way to doing that,” said Joe Bowring, who heads Monitoring Analytics, the independent market watchdog in the mid-Atlantic grid.

Data centers might have to adjust

Big Tech is trying to make their data centers more energy efficient. They are also installing backup generators, typically fueled by diesel, to ensure an uninterrupted power supply if there’s a power outage.

Data center operators, however, say they hadn’t anticipated needing that backup power supply to help grid operators meet demand and are closely watching how utility regulators in Texas write the regulations.

The Data Center Coalition, which represents Big Tech companies and data center developers, wants the standards to be flexible, since some data centers may not be able to switch to backup power as easily or as quickly as others.

The grid operator also should balance that system with financial rewards for data centers that voluntarily shut down during emergencies, said Dan Diorio of the Data Center Coalition.

Nation’s largest grid operator has a proposal

PJM’s just-released proposal revolves around a concept in which proposed data centers may not be guaranteed to receive electricity during a power emergency.

That’s caused a stir among power plant owners and the tech industry.

Many questioned PJM’s legal authority to enforce it or warned of destabilizing energy markets and states scaring off investors and developers with uncertainty and risk.

“This is particularly concerning given that states within PJM’s footprint actively compete with other U.S. regions for data center and digital infrastructure investment,” the Digital Power Network, a group of Bitcoin miners and data center developers, said in written comments to PJM.

The governors of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Illinois and Maryland said they worried that it’s too unpredictable to provide a permanent solution and that it should at least be accompanied by incentives for data centers to build new power sources and voluntarily reduce electricity use.

Others, including consumer advocates, warned that it won’t lower electric bills and that PJM should instead pursue a “bring your own generation” requirement for data centers to, in essence, build their own power source.

A deal is shrouded in secrecy

In Indiana, Google took a voluntary route.

Last month, the electric utility, Indiana & Michigan Power, and the tech giant filed a power-supply contract with Indiana regulators for a proposed $2 billion data center planned in Fort Wayne in which Google agreed to reduce electricity use there when the grid is stressed. The data center would, it said, reduce electricity use by delaying non-urgent tasks to when the electric grid is under less stress.

However, important details are being kept from the public and Ben Inskeep of the Citizens Action Coalition, a consumer advocacy group, said that leaves it unclear how valuable the arrangement really is, if at all.

A new way of thinking about electricity

To an extent, bumping big users off the grid during high-demand periods presents a new approach to electricity.

It could save money for regular ratepayers, since power is most expensive during peak usage periods.

Abe Silverman, an energy researcher at Johns Hopkins University, said that data centers can and do use all the electricity they want on most days.

But taking data centers off the grid for those handful of hours during the most extreme heat or cold would mean not having to spend billions of dollars to build a bunch of power plants, he said.

“And the question is, is that worth it? Is it worth it for society to build those 10 new power plants just to serve the data centers for five hours a year?” Silverman said. “Or is there a better way to do it?”",https://cc-production-uploads-bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2024/12/shutterstock_2502153963MainWEB.png,N,,2025-09-18 06:58:07.371046

For example, you could deduct up to $2,000 for a heat pump, a heat pump water heater, or a biomass stove or boiler, and then take an additional $1,200 for insulated doors, windows, skylights or weather stripping. Or, you could use the deduction on electrical components required to update the breaker box in your kitchen to allow for replacing a gas range with an induction model.

The caps and maximums do not apply to fuel cells, solar energy systems, geothermal heat pumps, battery storage, or small wind turbines. For these products, you can deduct up to 30 percent of the total cost, with no price cap or maximum deduction.

Some credits apply only to existing homes or to primary residences; some are only available in certain locations; and some are not available to renters.

Review the program requirements and the tax form instructions from the Internal Revenue Service before you make a purchase. Better still, have an accountant or your tax preparer help you.

And of course, save your receipts.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/09/18/multimedia/18re-calculator-tax-credits-gvhp/18re-calculator-tax-credits-gvhp-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-09-18 05:57:54.330020

Each of these factors reinforces the momentum, making heat pumps less of a niche and more of a new normal.
Final Takeaway So, why are heat pumps surging in popularity across America?","In just a few years, heat pumps have gone from a niche technology to one of the fastest-growing choices for American households.

Manufacturers are now shipping millions of units each year, and for the first time, heat pump sales have overtaken gas furnaces.

This shift reflects more than just a trend — it’s a fundamental change in how Americans heat and cool their homes.

One Device, Year-Round Comfort

The biggest reason behind this surge is simple: value. Heat pumps provide both heating in the winter and cooling in the summer.

Instead of generating heat, they move it, which makes them far more efficient than many traditional systems. For a homeowner replacing an old furnace or adding air conditioning, getting two systems in one makes heat pumps an attractive option.

Technology Has Caught Up

Not long ago, heat pumps were considered impractical in colder regions because they struggled in freezing weather.

That’s no longer true. Advances in compressor technology, refrigerants, and system design have created “cold-climate heat pumps” that can reliably warm homes even when outdoor temperatures plunge well below freezing.

Installers, too, are gaining more experience, which means better system design and fewer issues. Today’s heat pumps aren’t just an option for the South — they’re spreading to the Northeast and Midwest as well.

Incentives Make Them Affordable

Government support has been another game changer. Federal tax credits, state programs, and utility rebates are reducing the upfront cost of installing a heat pump.

For many homeowners, these financial incentives mean the difference between sticking with an old furnace and upgrading to a more efficient, modern system.

When you add in the fact that heat pumps can lower monthly energy bills — especially for households currently using oil or propane — the financial case becomes even stronger.

Regional Adoption Patterns

Heat pump adoption isn’t evenly spread across the country. In the South and Southeast, where winters are mild and air conditioning is essential, heat pumps are already a standard choice. In some states, more than a third of homes rely on them.

In colder regions, adoption has been slower, but momentum is building thanks to improved technology and generous state-level programs. Builders of new homes are also installing heat pumps at much higher rates than before, which means adoption will continue to grow.

More Than Just Comfort — Climate and Energy Goals

Beyond personal savings, heat pumps are helping meet bigger goals. As the U.S. grid brings in more renewable energy, electrifying home heating becomes an effective way to cut carbon emissions.

Heat pumps replace the need for on-site combustion of fossil fuels, improving indoor air quality and reducing environmental impact.

For many households, this added benefit is a powerful motivator. Choosing a heat pump isn’t just about saving money — it’s about future-proofing a home.

—–The U.S. Department of Energy has pointed to heat pumps as a central part of the nation’s transition toward a low-carbon energy system. With rising demand, better technology, and stronger policy support, heat pumps are on track to become a standard household choice by the 2030s.—

Barriers That Still Exist

Despite the momentum, there are still challenges. Upfront installation costs can be high, particularly if electrical panels or ductwork need upgrades.

In some states, high electricity rates make payback periods longer. And not every installer is trained to size and install heat pumps properly, which can affect performance.

There’s also an equity issue: renters and lower-income households often have fewer opportunities to switch, since decisions depend on landlords or financing options.

Why the Trend Will Continue

Even with these barriers, the direction is clear. Heat pumps are gaining ground because they solve real problems: they reduce energy bills, offer year-round comfort, and align with climate goals.

With technology improving and policies pushing toward electrification, their share of the market is expected to keep climbing.

Builders are increasingly installing them in new homes, homeowners are taking advantage of rebates, and more installers are recommending them. Each of these factors reinforces the momentum, making heat pumps less of a niche and more of a new normal.

Final Takeaway

So, why are heat pumps surging in popularity across America? Because they deliver on multiple fronts. They’re efficient, practical, increasingly affordable, and ready for climates where they once struggled.

At the same time, they help households save money and reduce their environmental impact.

For millions of Americans, that combination of comfort, cost savings, and sustainability makes the choice clear: the future of home heating and cooling is electric, and heat pumps are leading the way.

FAQs About Heat Pumps

1. Do heat pumps work in cold weather?

Yes. Modern cold-climate heat pumps can operate efficiently even below freezing, thanks to advanced compressors and refrigerants.

2. Are there tax credits for installing heat pumps?

Yes. The Inflation Reduction Act offers homeowners federal tax credits of up to $2,000, plus additional rebates depending on income and state programs.

3. How long does a heat pump last?

With proper maintenance, most heat pumps last 15–20 years, similar to traditional HVAC systems.

4. Are heat pumps expensive to run?

While upfront installation can cost more, their high efficiency often results in lower monthly bills, making them cost-effective in the long run.

5. Do heat pumps reduce carbon emissions?

Absolutely. By using electricity instead of fossil fuels, and with the grid increasingly powered by renewables, heat pumps are one of the most effective ways to lower household carbon footprints.

MADISON, Gov. – Tony Evers joined 17 other governors this week in calling on Congress to extend enhanced premium tax credits under the Affordable Care Act, ACA, warning that failure to act could result in higher premiums and loss of coverage for millions of Americans, including more than 276,000 Wisconsinites.

In a joint letter sent to congressional leadership, the governors emphasized that the ACA’s enhanced credits, set to expire at the end of 2025, lowered marketplace premiums by an average of 44 percent in 2024, according to the Center for American Progress. Without renewal, families could face thousands in added costs and widespread coverage losses.

Gov. Evers said the stakes are especially high for working families already struggling with rising costs.

“Far too many are feeling the pressure of rising costs, and folks should never have to choose between life-saving healthcare and getting their prescriptions or putting food on the table and keeping a roof over their head,” said Evers. “Now more than ever, we should be working to make healthcare more affordable and more accessible, not making it more expensive and harder for folks to get the care they need.”

The letter was addressed to House Speaker Mike Johnson, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, Senate Majority Leader John Thune, and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. It warns that if Congress fails to act swiftly, insurers will set 2026 rates without the enhanced credits, triggering a wave of sticker shock for consumers.

Gov. Evers also pointed to Wisconsin’s record-breaking ACA enrollment during the 2025 Open Enrollment Period, with more than 313,000 residents signing up for coverage on the individual marketplace, marking the highest enrollment in state history.

The governor credited the Biden, Harris Administration and Wisconsin’s congressional delegation, including Sen. Tammy Baldwin and Reps. Gwen Moore and Mark Pocan, for helping make coverage more affordable. In 2023, 88 percent of Wisconsin enrollees received premium subsidies, saving an average of $573.11 per month.

Evers also highlighted the success of the Wisconsin Healthcare Stability Plan, WIHSP, a bipartisan initiative signed into law in 2018 and extended through 2028. WIHSP has consistently lowered rates on the individual marketplace, reducing premiums by 14.5 percent in 2022 and 13.7 percent in 2023. Without WIHSP, rates on HealthCare.gov would have increased by 19.5 percent for the 2025 plan year, instead, they rose by just 8.2 percent.

Projected Premium Increases if Subsidies Expire

According to analysis by ACA Signups, if the enhanced subsidies expire at the end of 2025, Wisconsin residents could see average gross premiums increase by 19.9 percent in 2026. This estimate accounts for both the loss of enhanced subsidies and additional regulatory changes affecting affordability.

The Kaiser Family Foundation also estimates that nationally, premiums could rise by up to 75 percent for some enrollees, translating to an average increase of $700 per year. For Wisconsin’s 311,000 ACA enrollees, the financial impact could be substantial, especially for middle-income families who would again face the “subsidy cliff.”

Governor Points to Wisconsin Investments In Healthcare

Governor Evers also point to the final 2025-27 Biennial Budget, which was signed into law by Gov. Evers just a day before President Trump’s budget reconciliation bill was signed into law, secured an additional $1.1 billion to support healthcare access across Wisconsin, especially in rural communities, that would have been jeopardized had the President’s bill been enacted first.

“In addition to securing the additional $1.1 billion, the 2025-27 Biennial Budget signed into law by Gov. Evers made investments to support Wisconsin’s healthcare industry and ensure Wisconsinites have access to quality, affordable healthcare—especially in rural areas—with new efforts to bolster health systems across the state,” said Evers

Those investments included:

Continuing funding for BadgerCare;

Over $53 million to increase Medicaid reimbursement rates for personal care, obstetrics, private duty nursing, residential opioid treatment, and home health services, and more;

Fully funding the minimum fee schedule implemented by the Department of Health Services last biennium to help long-term care facilities avoid staffing cuts and closures;

$1.5 million in increased funding over the biennium for free and charitable clinics;

$7 million to support crisis intervention through the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline;

$2 million to support the WisCaregiver Career Program to help address the state’s shortage of certified nursing assistants and direct care professionals; and

$3.8 million to support Aging and Disability Resource Centers across the state, among many other critical provisions.

“I’ve always believed healthcare should not be a privilege afforded only to the healthy and the wealthy,” Evers said. “Wisconsinites should be able to get the healthcare they need when they need it.”

The full body of the governors’ joint letter is included below:

Speaker Johnson, Leader Jeffries, Leader Thune, and Leader Schumer,

We urge you to extend the Affordable Care Act’s enhanced premium tax credits. For millions of hard-working Americans, these subsidies are the only reason health insurance is still within reach in a country where the cost of living keeps going up.

If they expire, premiums will rise by thousands of dollars for many families, millions will lose coverage, and people will be forced to make impossible choices between paying for healthcare, rent, or groceries. Hard-working American families, older Americans not yet on Medicare, small business owners, and rural communities, where marketplace coverage is often the only option, will be hit the hardest.

The timing couldn’t be more urgent. Insurers are already setting 2026 rates. If Congress acts quickly, states can lock in lower premiums and spare families a wave of sticker shock this fall. If not, the damage will be felt for years.

This isn’t a partisan issue. It’s about protecting working people who are doing everything right but still struggling to get by. Extending these tax credits is one of the simplest, most effective steps Congress can take to keep healthcare affordable and provide real stability for millions of families.",https://vernonreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/aca-affrodable-care-act-adobestock_1088489180_editorial_use_only-by-tada-images.jpeg,N,,2025-09-18 08:00:02.623456

EV Realty does build and operate sites for passenger vehicles, such as the chargers it installed in a parking garage in Oakland, California, backed by power provider Ava Community Energy.
EV Realty is far from the only business building megawatt-scale truck-charging sites in California.
If anything, EV Realty has been ​“a little bit more slow and purposeful than others” in building its charging hubs, Sullivan said.
With dedicated charging in hand, freight companies and their customers can start to realize the underlying competitive economics of electric trucks, Sullivan said.","Electric trucks can beat diesel-fueled ones on the cost of moving freight from California’s seaports to its inland distribution hubs — as long as the battery-powered vehicles can reliably recharge at both ends of their route. That fact is spurring a boom in the construction of truck-charging depots across the state.

On Thursday, EV Realty, a San Francisco-based charging site developer, broke ground on what will be one of California’s biggest fully grid-powered, fast-charging depots for electric trucks so far.

The company’s site in San Bernardino, located in a region known as the Inland Empire that’s crowded with distribution warehouses, will pull about 10 megawatts of power from the grid once it’s up and running in early 2026. It will be equipped with 76 direct-current fast-charging ports, including a number of ultra-high-capacity chargers capable of refilling a Tesla Semi truck in 30 minutes or less.

EV Realty has more large-scale depots in the works, including another in San Bernardino, one in Torrance near the Port of Long Beach, and a fourth in Livermore in Northern California. Thursday’s groundbreaking was accompanied by the announcement that the company had raised $75 million from private equity investor NGP, which also led a $28 million investment in 2022.

With that cash infusion, along with last year’s debut of a joint venture with GreenPoint Partners to develop $200 million in charging hubs, ​“we are fully capitalized against an underwritten, five-year business plan,” EV Realty CEO Patrick Sullivan told Canary Media.

That plan includes ​“five to seven more projects of the scale we have in San Bernardino, plus some smaller, more built-to-suit projects,” he said.

EV Realty does build and operate sites for passenger vehicles, such as the chargers it installed in a parking garage in Oakland, California, backed by power provider Ava Community Energy. But the company isn’t in the business of setting up open public charging sites that depend on drive-by traffic to earn money back, Sullivan said.

Instead, it’s signing deals with major freight carriers and fleet owners that want a dedicated spot to get their trucks charged and back on the road as quickly as possible.

That’s why EV Realty’s 76 chargers at its San Bernardino site are all dedicated to specific customers, he said. Of those, 72 are committed to those paying monthly rates on multiyear contracts. ​“Our customers will have stalls and amounts of power that are theirs 24/7, and we will have customers basing their operations out of that site,” he said.

The remaining four chargers, including those offering high-voltage megawatt charging systems, are ​“pull-through” slots where trucks towing trailers can get a quick recharge. ​“That pricing will be more of a pay-as-you-go, per kilowatt-hour — but all those trucks are registered at our site,” he said.

EV Realty is far from the only business building megawatt-scale truck-charging sites in California. Big EV truck depots are springing up around Southern California’s massive port complexes and along its major freight corridors, built by startups such as Terawatt Infrastructure, Forum Mobility, Voltera, and WattEV; freight haulers like NFI Industries and Schneider National; and logistics operators such as Prologis.

Most of these depots are providing dedicated service to customers under contracts, but a few are starting to offer charging on a first-come, first-served basis. Greenlane, a joint venture of Daimler Truck North America, utility NextEra Energy, and investment firm BlackRock Alternatives, opened a 10-megawatt truck-charging site in Colton, a city neighboring San Bernardino, that’s meant to provide a more traditional ​“truck stop” service to vehicles needing to charge.

If anything, EV Realty has been ​“a little bit more slow and purposeful than others” in building its charging hubs, Sullivan said. But he insists that the broader truck-electrification project remains economically viable, despite the challenges erected by the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress.

There’s no doubt that electric trucking is experiencing a tough moment in California and across the country. The megalaw passed by Republicans in July cut short tax credits for commercial EVs and EV chargers that had been put in place by the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. This has weakened support for purchasing battery-powered vehicles, which still cost two to three times more than their fossil-fueled counterparts, even if EVs’ lower fueling and maintenance costs can make them cheaper in the long run.

This summer, Republicans and the Trump administration also revoked Clean Air Act provisions that permitted California and 10 other states to set mandates forcing manufacturers to sell increasing numbers of zero-emissions trucks. Last month, major truck manufacturers sued California, seeking to extricate themselves from a clean-vehicle partnership agreement.

Meanwhile, the Trump administration’s trade policies have thrown ​“sand into the works” of the U.S. freight industry, Sullivan said. Imports are set to decline significantly under President Donald Trump’s tariffs on foreign-made goods, and the on-again, off-again nature of his taxes has scrambled long-term planning.

“Carriers, trucking, transportation companies are at the very front lines of a global trade war,” Sullivan said. ​“You have no predictability on how you can utilize your assets.”

In the face of that uncertainty, cementing charging for electric trucks along established routes becomes more important than ever, he said. Like many of its charging depot competitors, EV Realty is inking partnerships with other parties in the broader freight-hauling industry, such as its August agreement with Prologis to share and streamline access and software systems across both companies’ networks.

With dedicated charging in hand, freight companies and their customers can start to realize the underlying competitive economics of electric trucks, Sullivan said. ​“A carrier bidding on freight on a lane is bidding whatever their marginal operating cost is, above or below the cost of fuel,” he said. ​“If you can move short and regional haul, point to point, with an EV, you’re bidding on a marginal cost that’s lower than diesel.”",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/EV-Realty-San-Bernardino-Mill-charging-site-artist-rendering-diagonal-aerial-building-foreground.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=92bd21149e43440c5846dea0ddf787b8,N,,2025-09-18 03:58:04.418309

There are currently 43 proposed carbon capture and sequestration projects in Louisiana, one of the few states to be awarded primary enforcement authority (or primacy) for the regulation of Class VI injection wells by the federal EPA. This means that, unlike many other states, the LDENR is in charge of the permit application review and approval process, allowing for more local control over proposed projects. Although the Hackberry approval is the culmination of a nearly 1.5-year permitting process, subsequent permitting actions should benefit from the LDNR's early rigorous review process, reducing future permitting timelines to less than one year.

Carbon capture and sequestration projects have become increasingly prevalent, offering stakeholders innovative strategies for managing CO2emissions. In a time when investors, customers, and governmental authorities often pressure industry to decrease CO2emissions, these projects present opportunities for companies to participate in domestic and foreign carbon reduction incentives. When paired with power generation facilities, carbon capture and sequestration can compound multiple benefits, contributing to national energy independence, producing clean, carbon-neutral energy, and creating credits eligible for sale in carbon markets worldwide

Carbon capture and sequestration projects involve capturing CO2before it is emitted from industrial facilities, transporting it to a permitted injection well, and injecting it deep underground for storage so that it cannot escape into the atmosphere. In addition to receiving a Class VI permit, before the capture, transportation, and injection of CO2may be carried out, emitting companies, operators, and landowners will enter into various agreements creating the necessary rights and obligations to undertake these activities and allocating the risks related thereto. Before entering into any such agreement, there are many issues all parties will need to consider, including ones raised by state officials.

Understanding the political headwinds, the varying regulatory regimes, and securing the appropriate legal services will be crucial to effectively navigating the risks in this new and complex environment.

The new policy and associated tariff revisions will require approval from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.
“Large loads want answers now.
“Most data center projects you hear about in the news today are hundreds of megawatts or even gigawatts in scale.
I think we can comfortably consider those to be large loads,” Webber said.","Dive Brief:

The Southwest Power Pool board of directors has approved a policy guiding the integration and interconnection of high impact large loads, or HILLs, such as data centers and manufacturing facilities, the grid operator announced Tuesday.

SPP plans to establish a 90-day study-and-approval process for interconnecting large loads, and said its HILLs process “enables early detection of system constraints, improves coordination across entities and prepares operators for real-time impacts.”

Peak load in SPP is expected to increase from 56 GW to 105 GW in the next 10 years, according to minutes from the board’s Sept. 4 meeting, where the HILLs policy was adopted. The new policy and associated tariff revisions will require approval from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.

Dive Insight:

With U.S. electricity demand poised to grow significantly after decades of stagnation, grid operators are seeking ways to speed the interconnection of new resources and loads.

PJM Interconnection has launched a fast-track stakeholder process to develop rules for interconnecting data centers, and aims to file a proposal with FERC by the end of the year. The Electric Reliability Council of Texas is working to implement new rules regarding data center interconnection that would require loads of 75 MW or more to participate in demand response programs.

“We’re striving to stay ahead of the game,” SPP Vice President for Engineering Casey Cathey said in a statement. “Large loads want answers now. They are motivated to invest and are looking for opportunities to connect to the grid now.”

The HILLs process will apply to interconnecting large loads that will be paired with new generation that is “either on-site or nearby,” SPP said, or for interconnecting large loads with current or planned generation. Load interconnections will be accelerated through integrated design, study, registration and operations.

“For developers, market efficiency and transparency are key benefits,” the grid operator said. The new approach supports “faster market entry, enhances price signals and allows these loads and supporting generation to have more confidence in expected costs and timelines.”

The HILLs policy was approved by the SPP board as Revision Request 696.

“This framework will maintain grid reliability and operational efficiency while balancing cost-effectiveness with expedited market deployment timelines,” according to the submission form.

According to RR 696, a load may be considered a High Impact Large Load if the point of interconnection is less than or equal to 69 kV and the HILL peak demand is greater than or equal to 10 MW, or if the interconnection point is greater than 69 kV and the HILL peak demand is greater than or equal to 50 MW.

As various grid operators study new large loads and the availability of grid resources to serve them, data center developers may find opportunity in building out smaller operations, Digital Power Optimization CEO Andrew Webber said in an email. The company, founded by Webber, builds and manages data centers.

“Most data center projects you hear about in the news today are hundreds of megawatts or even gigawatts in scale. I think we can comfortably consider those to be large loads,” Webber said. But smaller projects “can slip below those thresholds and perhaps create a smoother, less costly interconnection process.”

If a data center developer approaches a utility asking for 500 MW of firm power, it could cost $100 million in system upgrades and take five years or more, Webber said.

“If you ask that same entity for 35 MW or 58 MW (or whatever amount they have readily available) it can be much faster and without such significant system upgrade costs,” he said. “We think this is a massive overlooked opportunity.”",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/_OhCkyLeK0etZL5KhDYDlutR9NLD4fnmRvMz3c7yQjE/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0yMjE5NDgwMDE5XzEuanBn.webp,N,,2025-09-18 02:59:00.557150

As we now know, certain initiatives—including solar and wind energy technologies—took a large hit. This was due to the OBBBA significantly expediting phaseouts of clean energy tax credits established by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022.

Fortunately, other technologies that support thermal energy storage will continue to offer both environmental benefits from the technology itself and the benefits of tax credits. These solutions include mineral fiber ceiling panel options that harness the capability of phase change materials (PCM) to regulate room temperature without electricity or other power sources.

Given the impact of OBBBA, energy saving ceiling solutions may have an expanded role to play in building design, operation, and management decisions. One reason for this is that, tax incentive or not, the motivation for facility builders, owners, and operators to advance sustainability and decarbonization goals remains unchanged. The drive of a company or organization to be environmentally responsible will not vanish along with certain energy tax incentives. Still, the availability of tax credits can be an important consideration when looking at the overall design—and related budget—of a new construction or renovation project. Once again, this is where energy saving ceiling solutions can help.

How Energy Saving Ceilings Work

The built environment’s drive to decarbonize, save energy, and employ thoughtful use of resources presents architects and designers with a new set of requirements for new construction or renovations. Adding to the challenges is facility owners prioritizing elevated indoor environmental quality (IEQ) for occupants. This can mean everything from maintaining comfortable temperatures to achieving proper acoustics. These mandatories have turned the attention of architects and designers to ceiling panels with PCM. In addition to thermal energy storage allowing passive heating and cooling to keep a space at a comfortable 72 degrees F., these panels offer strong acoustical performance.

Although the use of PCM technology in ceiling panels is a recent innovation, its roots go back centuries. Consider an old-fashioned “icebox.” The ice (PCM) absorbs heat to keep the box contents cool. During this process the ice changes to a liquid, which will again solidify at temperatures of 32 degrees F., releasing heat.

To understand energy saving ceiling panels, think of the “ice” as PCM (basically comprised of salt and water) encased in the ceiling panel. When temperatures rise in a space with energy saving ceilings installed, the crystalized PCM gradually dissolves. During this process, it absorbs and stores heat to passively cool the space. As that space cools stored heat is released, the PCM in the ceiling panels re-solidifies, and the space warms up. Heat transfer happens around 72 degrees F., making energy saving ceilings effective for cooling and heating—supporting thermal comfort without mechanics, energy expenditure, or fossil fuels.

According to research estimates measured in laboratory tests, ceiling panels with PCM technology can reduce energy costs and consumption by as much as 15% (results may vary). In addition, energy saving ceilings offer advantages including:

Reduced reliance on fossil-fuel powered HVAC systems

Less wear on HVAC systems, an alternative to more costly HVAC system upgrades or replacements

Improved thermal comfort

Ability to enhance IEQ with features like acoustical sound blocking and absorption

Easy installation, little-to-no maintenance

Energy saving ceiling products also fit into the thermal comfort portion of the WELL Building Standard and can contribute to many LEED credits, including Materials & Resources, IEQ, and Energy & Atmosphere credits. Moreover, energy saving ceilings align with two key impact areas established with the recently introduced LEED v5—decarbonization that targets reduction in operational and embodied carbon and other emissions, and quality of life improvements in health, well-being, resilience, and equity for building occupants and their communities.

Up to 50% in Tax Credits Available Under the Inflation Reduction Act

In addition to energy-saving, lower maintenance, and other cost benefits realized over the lifetime of their use, PCM ceiling panels qualify for certain tax credits. Projects utilizing energy-saving ceiling panels may qualify for Investment Tax Credit (ITC) 48E. Because of their thermal energy storage properties, most projects using PCM ceiling panels may qualify for:

Up to 40% federal tax credit

Additional 10% tax credit if the project is deployed in an “Energy Community.” (i.e., a Brownfields site or fossil-fuel-dependent community)

As part of the process, it’s advisable to consult your tax advisor to confirm qualification of your project. In addition, talking with the ceiling manufacturer might reveal additional opportunities to help maximize tax savings opportunities when investing in energy-saving ceilings for a project. For example, when installing a ceiling, in addition to the energy saving ceiling panels, it’s possible the associated grid, trim, and labor may also qualify for tax credits under ITC 48E. Because these panels are made in the USA of domestic and global content, they also meet a requirement for additional tax savings.* Qualifying energy saving ceiling projects include those of taxpayers and non-taxpaying entities and span multiple sectors, including public, private, education, and 501 (c)(3) charitable organization.

From Building Optimization to Bottom-Line Improvements

In June, energy saving ceiling products were introduced into a leading energy-modeling resource (the IES Virtual Environmental software), used by engineers and architects to optimize whole-building performance. To become part of the software, these ceilings underwent a rigorous validation process involving hundreds of modeling studies. The inclusion of the PCM ceiling panels in this software further demonstrates their potential to support decarbonization priorities and offers a strong indication of the longevity they will enjoy as an energy-saving solution.

From government, corporate headquarters and nonprofit offices to healthcare, schools and college facilities—the applications in which energy saving ceilings can impact a building’s environmental objectives, energy-reduction criteria, IEQ requirements, and the bottom line are expansive. Moreover, the ramping up of energy saving ceiling validation and adoption couldn’t be better timed, as their use could help fill some of the “budgetary gap” left by OBBBA’s phaseout of tax credits on other energy technologies.

Rupert Mayer, a co-founder of Bright Saver, a California-based nonprofit partner that helps states and individuals set up plug-in solar systems, indicated at Wednesday’s press conference that there are 4 million portable solar units.
The portable solar panels also enabled freedom and independence in one’s backyard without government interference, Mayer said.
He said Bright Saver was talking to lawmakers across blue and red states to advance portable solar and help consumers experience its benefits.
In August, Pennsylvania legislators also began considering such a bill to facilitate widespread deployment of balcony solar.","While Vermonters look for ways to lower their energy costs, access to plug-in and portable solar panels could lower bills and carbon emissions, according to a new campaign launched in Montpelier on Wednesday.

Balcony solar, or miniature panels that can be set up on a patio or lawn, have gained popularity across Europe, and now Vermont is angling to become the second state to duplicate such a program. Sen. Anne Watson, D/P-Washington, chair of the Senate Natural Resources and Energy Committee, plans to introduce a bill during the 2026 legislative session to make plug-in solar panels available to Vermonters who can’t install a traditional net metering system, she said at a press conference.

“My goal is to make it as easy as possible for people to purchase and plug in one of these devices and start saving money, while also getting the electric utilities the information that they need to meet their own requirements,” Watson said.

The bill would propose removing current requirements like interconnection agreements with utilities and registration, as is currently required with solar installations 10 times as large, Watson said. Residents would only need to notify their electric companies that they had such a system under her bill, Watson said.

“Seeing Utah pass a bill like this unanimously, and in a bipartisan way, that support underscored how doable I think this bill is going to be,” Watson said. “It’s time for us to get out of the way, cut that red tape, and make it easy for Vermonters to access affordable solar.”

Such a project could make renewable energy more available to all Vermonters, according to Ben Edgerly Walsh, a lobbyist for the Vermont Public Interest Research Group, a state-based environmental advocacy group. While 20,000 Vermont families have benefitted from household solar through the state’s net metering program, Walsh said, hundreds of thousands have been left out, including those who rent or live in condos or mobile homes.

“One part of the solar market hardest to open up is renters, and people who can’t afford to have solar on their property,” Walsh said Monday.

But these smaller units, capped at 1.2 kilowatts under the proposed legislation, can be plugged into a normal wall outlet where electrons can start flowing into the house, helping to power appliances and energize light switches. They can also be connected to a battery that can save the energy for when it’s needed. Walsh estimated it could power about a fifth of a typical household, or save about $20 on a $100 electric bill.

The small systems are also more affordable because they don’t require the same installation costs and the logistics of connecting to the grid. One unit could cost Vermonters $1,500 to $2,000, Walsh estimated, which could be paid back in about three years before adding free power to a household for the life of the system.

In Germany, these systems now help power at least 1 million households, but those estimates could be three times as high, according to reporting by The New York Times. Rupert Mayer, a co-founder of Bright Saver, a California-based nonprofit partner that helps states and individuals set up plug-in solar systems, indicated at Wednesday’s press conference that there are 4 million portable solar units.

The portable solar panels also enabled freedom and independence in one’s backyard without government interference, Mayer said. He said Bright Saver was talking to lawmakers across blue and red states to advance portable solar and help consumers experience its benefits.

“It should be fairly non-controversial,” Walsh said of the initiative. “It just requires cutting a little red tape in a few places to make it possible.”

While such a move isn’t as precedent-setting as Vermont’s Climate Superfund Act or its attempt at a Clean Heat Standard, the state could be among the first to support balcony solar.

In Utah, a bipartisan bill passed unanimously this year to reduce restrictions and expand access to this small-scale, affordable solar option. Utah Republican Gov. Spencer J. Cox signed the bill into law in March. In August, Pennsylvania legislators also began considering such a bill to facilitate widespread deployment of balcony solar.

But while Utah’s bill became a success story, Vermont could see pushback.

“The Trump administration, they’ve doubled down on fossil fuels and they’re really doing all they can to upend the clean energy job sector,” said Johanna Miller, the energy and climate program director at the Vermont Natural Resources Council. But Miller said the 2020 Global Warming Solutions Act says the state has an obligation and an opportunity to help Vermonters move away from the burning of fossil fuels, the largest contributor to climate change.

“The sad truth is that climate and energy policy is one of the most polarized areas in a very polarized political environment,” Walsh said. But he added there are no subsidies for this program — the legislation only asked to make it easier to install these systems without requiring net metering or grid connection.

“For all the climate policies you can imagine us working on, this one is certainly the best set up for bipartisan support,” Walsh said.

Vermont recently lost a major solar investment when the federal government slashed $62.5 million the state was promised by the Solar For All program, following President Donald Trump signing his One Big Beautiful Bill in July.

The principles, developed alongside dozens of labor, public interest, and environmental organizations, marks the first time those groups have clearly defined what climate investments should, and should not, look like.

Read the Principles for Climate Solutions Investments: https://www.sierraclub.org/articles/2025/09/principles-financial-institutions-credible-investments-climate-solutions

The recommendations go beyond merely asking investors to support clean energy technologies, green manufacturing, and zero-emissions transportation, detailing how investors should also pursue opportunities that support community climate resilience, including investments in green, affordable housing, as part of any comprehensive climate strategy. In the process, these investments can help create green jobs in local communities.

“Climate change is the single greatest systemic risk facing our economy, and pension funds are on the front lines. Investing in the low-carbon transition is necessary to protect pensions from these risks. People’s retirement savings should not prop up polluting infrastructure that endangers the planet and pension benefits — it should fund investments that protect financial security, enable dignified retirements, and help people retire into safe, liveable, and economically resilient communities. Our guiding principles set a clear standard: credible climate investments must cut emissions, build resilient communities, and protect nature. Investors have a responsibility to put workers’ long-term security ahead of short-term profits,” said Jessye Waxman, Campaign Advisor in the Sierra Club’s Sustainable Finance campaign.

SETTING A NEW STANDARD

With these principles, climate and labor groups are setting a new standard for what constitutes credible investments in climate solutions. Some of the recommendations go beyond investor guidance coming out of places like Europe, where frameworks such as the EU Taxonomy allows some investments in gas infrastructure to qualify as “transitional” or “green” financing, even though such projects risk locking in future carbon emissions. The principles emphasize that investments in climate solutions must:

Prioritize real-world decarbonization by financing projects and companies driving measurable, real-world emissions reductions.

Facilitate the energy transition by building solar and wind capacity, as well as improvements in grid infrastructure, energy storage, and energy efficiency.

Protect nature and biodiversity, given that over half the world’s GDP depends on healthy ecosystems.

Support community climate resilience, including green housing, community adaptation, and pollution reduction, to protect workers and their communities.

Support economic resilience, including seeking out regional investments, creating green jobs, and supporting globally equitable climate finance.

Advance a just transition by supporting worker protections, investing in Indigenous stewardship, and prioritizing communities most harmed by climate change.

Provide credible transition finance by financing high-emitting companies only if they are implementing a credible transition plan.

The principles clarify that investments in carbon offsets, unbundled renewable energy credits, carbon capture and storage, gas infrastructure, data centers, and artificial intelligence, among other things, are not credible climate solutions investments.

QUOTES FROM ENDORSING ORGANIZATIONS

The principles are endorsed by 43 organizations, including the Labor Network for Sustainability, Action Center on Race and the Economy (ACRE), Americans for Financial Reform Education Fund, Public Citizen, and Third Act.

“Workers deserve benefits that benefit them. By making sustainable investments, pension funds can not only safeguard retirements, but safeguard our future against climate catastrophe by investing in clean energy, good jobs, and a just transition. Pensions are always about protecting workers' futures, and these principles ensure that investments go toward building a future that benefits all working people,” said Sydney Ghazarian, Strategic Campaigns Director, Labor Network for Sustainability.

“The principles lay out what public pensions need to do to meet the current moment and protect workers from systemic risks like climate change and economic inequality. In addition to clean energy and resilience, pensions should focus on systems-level solutions that include infrastructure, affordable housing, community development, credible transition finance, and much more,"" said Alex Martin, Climate Finance Policy Director at Americans for Financial Reform Education Fund.

One area of research has focused on the reservoirs of the Andean region, with five of Argentina’s hydroelectric power plants on the Limay River considered as a case study. These are the:

Alicurá (1000MW and capacity factor of 25%).

Piedra del Águila (1400MW and CF of 45%)

Pichi Picún Leufú (250MW and CF of 48%)

El Chocón (1200MW and CF of 29%)

Arroyito (120MW and CF of 68%)

Collectively generating 12,830GWh annually, these projects have an installed capacity of 3970MW, yielding an overall capacity factor of 37% (equivalent to less than 9 hours of operation per day).

As Dr Luis Juanico and Martin Ducos explain, in practice, “their effective generation capacity is significantly constrained by the availability of water resources, which are highly variable and generally scarce – a characteristic of all mountain rivers”.

Although designed to operate continuously, the average annual capacity factors of these plants reportedly range from 25% to 50% and typically operate to meet peak demand for 6 to 12 hours per day.

“This reflects a significant idle capacity – ranging from 50% to 75%, or 12 to 18 hours daily – in both the power transformation system and the National Interconnected System transmission line,” Juanico and Ducos add.

Furthermore, generation is influenced by seasonal and climatic variations such as a recent 35% reduction in generation at Piedra del Águila – driven by a sharp 55% decrease in the flow of the Collón Curá River, a tributary of the Limay.

Juanico and Ducos put forward two proposals in their research. The first doubles installed capacity by adding PV power equivalent to hydroelectric capacity, increasing energy production to 23,707GWh with an investment of US$1.925 billion. The second proposal aims for a higher capacity factor by doubling the PV capacity and adding a four-hour battery storage system. This results in a 92% capacity factor, increasing energy production to 31,899GWh, and requiring an investment of US$4.431 billion.

Although this is a significant increase in cost, the authors add that in comparison installing two nuclear reactors (1800MW each) to generate a similar amount of energy would require an investment and construction timeframe eleven times greater.

Efficient Cooling Source. The reservoirs offer an abundant supply of crystal-clear, low-mineral water with an annual average temperature of 11°C, significantly cooler than the 21°C average of the Paraná River near Buenos Aires.

Secure and Isolated Locations. The remoteness of the hydroelectric sites, combined with existing security measures, ensures high levels of protection.

Clean Air Environment. The absence of soot and pollution guarantees ideal operating conditions for sensitive AI equipment.

According to the authors, both proposals have clear benefits of abundant solar resources – the Andean Patagonia region boasts a high solar resource potential, especially during the summer months when water availability for hydroelectric generation is low; plus low-cost land – the land adjacent to the reservoirs is available at minimal expense due to its remote

desert location.

The authors also believe this synergy could help mitigate Argentina’s frequent summer electricity shortages. In addition, the high modularity and simplicity of solar PV farms allow for rapid deployment and potential operation in under a year because complex infrastructure, such as power stations and high-voltage lines, is already in place.

The proposal could also be replicated in other Andean basins in Argentina, such as the reservoirs in the provinces of Mendoza (Los Reyunos, El Tigre, Agua del Toro, Nihuil I, II, III, and Potrerillos), San Juan (Ullum, Caracoles, Punta Negra, and La Olla), Salta (Cabra Corral), among others. Furthermore, Juanico and Ducos say it could also encompass other Latin American countries, many of which have hydroelectric plants at the foothills of the Andes with significant

solar resources.

Ecuadorian experience

A similar study has been looking at the potential for co-locating FPVs with existing hydropower plants in Ecuador.

As a country that is heavily reliant on hydropower, and with approximately 80% of its electricity generated by hydroelectricity in 2023, Ecuador is facing energy challenges, particularly when the availability of hydro plants is reduced during the dry seasons. And although planned blackouts have been implemented in various provinces to conserve water supplies in reservoirs since October 2023, this hasn’t prevented unforeseen blackouts. A nationwide outage on 19 June 2024 lasted over three hours. Caused by a failure in the Milagro–Zhoray transmission line, it was compounded by a storm that affected two of Ecuador’s largest hydropower plants – Coca Codo Sinclair and Agoyán – during which sediment washed into the facilities, forcing the turbines to shut down.

As Rodriguez-Gallegos et al state in the journal Solar: “Ecuador’s heavy reliance on hydropower for electricity generation, combined with recent blackouts caused by prolonged dry seasons, underscores the importance of diversifying energy sources. The integration of FPVs with HPPs offers a promising opportunity to enhance energy security by reducing dependency on a single energy source.”

Their findings reveal that out of 70 HPPs in Ecuador, 11 present favourable conditions for large-scale FPV deployment. Among these were the 40MW Cumbayá project which exhibited the most suitable conditions, supporting a maximum FPV capacity of 17MWp. Marcel Laniado de Wind HPP (213 MW) and Mazar HPP (170 MW) were also identified as optimal candidates, each with potential FPV capacities equal to their installed hydropower capacities.

Furthermore, the authors add their results show that FPV systems can not only contribute additional electricity to the grid but also improve HPP performance by reducing water evaporation from reservoirs and maintaining generation capacity during dry seasons, when solar irradiation is

typically higher.

And although their study primarily aims to provide scientific evidence on the potential of FPV-HPP co-location, the authors hope it can also ‘serve as a springboard for future research’, helping to guide Ecuadorian government authorities and investors in adopting FPV technology to strengthen the country’s energy infrastructure.

Benefits of floating photovoltaics

Rodriguez-Gallegos et al give an insight into the benefits of floating photovoltaics when installed at existing hydropower plants.

Infrastructure efficiency

Since HPPs are already fully connected to the electrical grid, the same infrastructure can be used by FPV systems to feed electricity into transmission lines. This reduces FPV installation costs and optimises the use of existing grid capacity by increasing the total energy output. Additionally, other shared infrastructure, such as access roads, can be utilised for both HPP and FPV systems, simplifying installation and maintenance.

Water conservation

FPV systems partially block sunlight from reaching the water surface, reducing evaporation, helping to retain more water in reservoirs which can then be used to generate electricity during times of need.

Seasonal synergy

HPPs often face challenges during prolonged dry seasons due to reduced water availability in their reservoirs. FPV systems can help offset this by generating more electricity during dry periods, which are typically associated with high solar irradiance. Conversely, during the rainy season, while FPV energy production may decline, HPPs can generate ample electricity due to increased water availability. This seasonal complementarity enhances overall energy reliability.

Increased capacity

Expanding the energy production of HPPs often requires constructing additional dams, which can raise environmental concerns. While FPV systems also have environmental impacts that must be assessed, they may offer a more environmentally friendly alternative for boosting total energy production by leveraging existing water surfaces without the need for new infrastructure.

Environmental benefits

By shading parts of the water, FPV systems can reduce or prevent algae blooms, which can improve water quality and the overall ecological conditions of the reservoir.",https://www.waterpowermagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/09/shutterstock_2591400633.jpg,N,,2025-09-18 07:59:48.487184

More native plants mean more rest stops and nesting grounds for pollinators like birds, butterflies and bees, which have faced serious population declines in recent decades.
Astilli, the Littleton homeowner, remade her backyard with native plants a few years ago, goldenrod, sunflowers, rudbeckia, purple poppy mallow, Rocky Mountain bee plant and more.","LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) — When Lena Astilli first bought her home outside of Denver, she had no interest in matching the wall-to-wall green lawns that dominated her block. She wanted native plants, the kind she remembered and loved as a child in New Mexico, that require far less water and have far more to offer insects and birds that are in decline.

“A monoculture of Kentucky bluegrass is not helping anybody,” Astilli said. After checking several nurseries before finding one that had what she wanted, she has slowly been reintroducing those native plants to her yard.

Though Astilli was replacing grass just last month, it remains ubiquitous in American yards. It’s a tradition that began more than two centuries ago with the landed gentry copying the landscaping of Europe’s wealthy, and grass now dominates as the familiar planting outside everything from single-family homes to apartment complexes to office parks and retail malls.

“In the absence of simple directions and guidance about what to do with their landscape, they default to lawn because it’s easy,” said Mark Richardson, executive director of the Ecological Landscape Alliance, a nonprofit that promotes sustainable landscaping.

Yet that grass is problematic in deserts and any place with limited water, such as the American West, where it won’t do well without irrigation. As climate change makes the world hotter and triggers more extreme weather, including drought, thirsty expanses of groomed emerald are taxing freshwater supplies that are already under stress.

Enter xeriscaping, landscaping aimed at vastly reducing the need for irrigation, including by using native or drought-tolerant plants. (Denver Water says it coined the term in 1981 by combining “landscape” with the Greek word “xeros,” which means dry, to encourage reduced water use.)

Reasons to think about ripping up that lawn

The average U.S. family uses 320 gallons (1,211 liters) of water every day, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. Nearly a third of that is devoted to outdoor water use. It’s even more for people with thirsty plants in dry places.

“Potable water is going to become harder and harder to come by,” said Richardson. “Lawn reduction is a fantastic way to limit the use of water in the landscape.”

His group isn’t keen on grass even in areas like the Northeast or Midwest, where drought and water use aren’t as problematic as in the West. Less lawn means fewer pesticides and fertilizers washing into rivers. More native plants mean more rest stops and nesting grounds for pollinators like birds, butterflies and bees, which have faced serious population declines in recent decades.

“We can bring nature back into our urban and suburban areas,” said Haven Kiers, associate professor of landscape architecture at University of California-Davis. “Improving biodiversity, creating habitat is going to be a huge thing for the environment.”

It’s also better for the people using the yard, Kiers said.

“So many studies show that spending time in nature and gardening, all of this is really good for you,” Kiers said. “When they’re doing that, they’re not talking about mowing the lawn.”

Taking the first steps

Kiers says the only thing more intimidating than an expanse of lawn is an expanse of unplanted dirt. Her top recommendation: take it slowly. It also mitigates the cost, because she said paying someone to do it all at once can cost tens of thousands of dollars.

If you’ve got beds along the outside of the house, expand them. If you’ve got a path leading to the front door, put shrubs or flowers on either side of it. If you don’t have shade, plant a tree, and if you’ve got a tree already, create a bed around it. All of these steps reduce the lawn space.

There are also financial incentives and rebates in several states to make the transformation more affordable. Sometimes they’re offered by a city, county, state, water agency or local conservation organizations, so searching for the programs available with the municipalities and companies near you is a good place to start.

Looking for landscaping ideas? “If you want to see good examples of horticulture at its finest, visit a public garden,” Richardson said. Kiers recommended finding a master gardener or a community garden volunteer, because they’ll often provide expertise free of charge.

What’s in Lena’s yard?

Astilli, the Littleton homeowner, remade her backyard with native plants a few years ago, goldenrod, sunflowers, rudbeckia, purple poppy mallow, Rocky Mountain bee plant and more. Some green lawn remains for her dog and child to romp.

Late this summer, she was getting her hands dirty converting the front yard to xeriscaping. With the help of Restorative Landscape Design and its owner, Eryn Murphy, Astilli was replacing grass with plants like bee balm, evening primrose, scarlet gilia, prairie dropseed and tall thimbleweed.

In a break from the work, Murphy reeled off a few of the different possible looks for low-water landscaping: a gravel garden with perennials, lush prairie, a crevice or rock garden with tiny plants growing in the stone features, a cactus garden.

“Really the sky is the limit in terms of your creativity and your aesthetic,” she said. “It’s just about using plants that are supposed to be here.”

Murphy said an ever-drier West due to climate change will require people to “do something” as lawns become less and less viable.

The Conversation is an independent and nonprofit source of news, analysis and commentary from academic experts.

Some major oil companies such as Shell and BP that once were touted as leading the way in clean energy investments are now pulling back from those projects to refocus on oil and gas production. Others, such as Exxon Mobil and Chevron, have concentrated on oil and gas but announced recent investments in carbon capture projects, as well as in lithium and graphite production for electric vehicle batteries.

National oil companies have also been investing in renewable energy. For example, Saudi Aramco has invested in clean energy while at the same time asserting that it’s unrealistic to phase out oil and gas entirely.

But the larger question is why oil companies would invest in clean energy at all, especially at a time when many federal clean energy incentives are being eliminated and climate science is being dismantled, at least in the United States.

Some answers depend on whom you ask. More traditional petroleum industry followers would urge the companies to keep focused on their core fossil fuel businesses to meet growing energy demand and corresponding near-term shareholder returns. Other shareholders and stakeholders concerned about sustainability and the climate — including an increasing number of companies with sustainability goals — would likely point out the business opportunities for clean energy to meet global needs.

Other answers depend on the particular company itself. Very small producers have different business plans than very large private and public companies. Geography and regional policies can also play a key role. And government-owned companies such as Saudi Aramco, Gazprom and the China National Petroleum Corp. control the majority of the world’s oil and gas resources with revenues that support their national economies.

Despite the relatively modest scale of investment in clean energy by oil and gas companies so far, there are several business reasons oil companies would increase their investments in clean energy over time.

The oil and gas industry has provided energy that has helped create much of modern society and technology, though those advances have also come with significant environmental and social costs. My own experience in the oil industry gave me insight into how at least some of these companies try to reconcile this tension and to make strategic portfolio decisions regarding what “green” technologies to invest in. Now the managing director and a professor of the practice at the Ray C. Anderson Center for Sustainable Business at Georgia Tech, I seek ways to eliminate the boundaries and identify mutually reinforcing innovations among business interests and environmental concerns.

Diversification and financial drivers

Just like financial advisers tell you to diversify your 401(k) investments, companies do so to weather different kinds of volatility, from commodity prices to political instability. Oil and gas markets are notoriously cyclical, so investments in clean energy can hedge against these shifts for companies and investors alike.

Clean energy can also provide opportunities for new revenue. Many customers want to buy clean energy, and oil companies want to be positioned to cash in as this transition occurs. By developing employees’ expertise and investing in emerging technologies, they can be ready for commercial opportunities in biofuels, renewable natural gas, hydrogen and other pathways that may overlap with their existing, core business competencies.

Fossil fuel companies have also found what other companies have: Clean energy can reduce costs. Some oil companies not only invest in energy efficiency for their buildings but use solar or wind to power their wells. And adding renewable energy to their activities can also lower the cost of investing in these companies.

Public pressure

All companies, including those in oil and gas, are under growing pressure to address climate change, from the public, from other companies with whom they do business and from government regulators — at least outside the U.S. For example, campaigns seeking to reduce investment in fossil fuels are increasing along with climate-related lawsuits. Government policies focused on both mitigating carbon emissions and enhancing energy independence are also making headway in some locations.

In response, many oil companies are reducing their own operational emissions and setting targets to offset or eliminate emissions from products that they sell — though many observers question the viability of these commitments. Other companies are investing in emerging technologies such as hydrogen and methods to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere

Some companies, such as BP and Equinor, have previously even gone so far as rebranding themselves and acquiring clean energy businesses. But those efforts have also been criticized as “greenwashing,” taking actions for public relations value rather than real results.

How far can this go?

It is even possible for a fossil fuel company to reinvent itself as a clean energy operation. Denmark’s Orsted — formerly known as Danish Oil and Natural Gas — transitioned from fossil fuels to become a global leader in offshore wind. The company, whose majority owner is the Danish government, made the shift, however, with the help of significant public and political support.

But most large oil companies aren’t likely to completely reinvent themselves anytime soon. Making that change requires leadership, investor pressure, customer demand and shifts in government policy, such as putting a price or tax on carbon emissions.

To show students in my sustainability classes how companies’ choices affect both the environment and the industry as a whole, I use the MIT Fishbanks simulation. Students run fictional fishing companies competing for profit. Even when they know the fish population is finite, they overfish, leading to the collapse of the fishery and its businesses. Short-term profits cause long-term disaster for the fishery and the businesses that depend on it.

The metaphor for oil and gas is clear: As fossil fuels continue to be extracted and burned, they release planet-warming emissions, harming the planet as a whole. They also pose substantial business risks to the oil and gas industry itself.

Yet students in a recent class showed me that a more collective way of thinking may be possible. Teams voluntarily reduced their fishing levels to preserve long-term business and environmental sustainability, and they even cooperated with their competitors. They did so without in-game regulatory threats, shareholder or customer complaints, or lawsuits.

Their shared understanding that the future of their own fishing companies was at stake makes me hopeful that this type of leadership may take hold in real companies and the energy system as a whole. But the question remains about how fast that change can happen, amid the accelerating global demand for more energy along with the increasing urgency and severity of climate change and its effects.

But in the Inland Empire, many of the region’s largest employers have already secured major solar systems in recent years, underscoring both the benefits and the stakes.

From Loma Linda University Health’s new two-megawatt microgrid to Esri’s campus-wide rooftop arrays and Kaiser Permanente’s solar-plus-storage hospital system in Ontario, institutions are betting on clean energy for predictable costs, resilience and sustainability.

Why it matters: Their investments highlight what’s at risk for smaller adopters as federal and state incentives shrink. With new federal legislation reshaping incentives, projects like these highlight the value of local, reliable power that can cut costs and keep running during emergencies.

Case study: Loma Linda University Health

Loma Linda University Health has unveiled a renewable microgrid system that will power its Faculty Medical Clinics with clean, reliable energy while reducing costs and supporting long-term sustainability.

After three years of planning and 18 months of construction, the system became fully operational on Aug. 22. It includes 3,622 solar panels capable of generating up to two megawatts of power and a one-megawatt Tesla battery that can store excess energy and provide up to six hours of emergency backup power.

Installed atop the P4 parking garage and above physician parking, the panels also provide shade and support 10 electric vehicle charging stations.

With the microgrid, the clinics can generate 87 percent of their daily electricity needs, saving an estimated $500,000 to $1.5 million annually depending on utility rates. The locked-in energy contract will provide consistent pricing at 15 cents per kilowatt hour for the next 30 years, compared to current Southern California Edison rates of 17 to 24 cents.

“Our solar panel infrastructure strengthens our ability to care for the community, even during emergencies,” said Ricardo Peverini, president of the Loma Linda University Faculty Medical Group. “It reduces our environmental footprint, makes our operations more resilient and saves resources that we can reinvest into patient care. It’s a healthier future for our patients, our staff and our region.”

Who else went solar locally?

Loma Linda’s system is one of several major projects completed in the region over the past five years:

Esri (Redlands): Installed 1.8 megawatts of rooftop panels across its headquarters campus.

University of Redlands: Announced a two-phase campus-wide solar build in 2024.

Kaiser Permanente Ontario Medical Center: Completed a 2-MW solar canopy system with 9 MWh of battery storage in 2025.

Amazon Air Hub at San Bernardino International Airport: Opened in 2021 with rooftop solar as part of its design.

Altus Power / San Manuel Landing (San Bernardino): Launched a 1.6-MW rooftop system in 2024.

In 2022, the city of Redlands passed new rules for distribution warehouse developers requiring rooftop solar as part of the conditions of approval.

As organizations have been adopting solar power, individuals have also been able to take advantage of tax rebates on renewable energy installations through the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act.

Zoom out to national policy

While projects like Loma Linda’s showcase the potential of renewable energy, the national policy landscape is moving in the opposite direction. The “One Big Beautiful Bill,” signed into law in July 2025, stripped away many of the clean-energy incentives that previously fueled solar adoption across the country.

Key changes include the elimination of the residential solar tax credit after Dec. 31, 2025. This credit meant that homeowners could get up to 30% off the cost of solar and energy-efficient equipment or installation. Not only do these technologies help reduce climate pollution, they can also make energy bills more affordable.

The law also reduced corporate incentives, scaling back the 30 percent investment tax credit that had helped businesses offset the cost of large solar and storage projects.

A separate incentive for heat pumps and insulation is also ending on Dec. 31, 2025. The incentive is called the Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit and provides up to $2,000 off heat pumps, water heaters, biomass stoves or boilers on your tax bill. Up to $1,200 was also offered for home upgrades including insulation, doors and windows.

California’s net metering program was recently reduced under NEM 3.0, meaning homeowners exporting energy back to the grid get paid much less than in the past.

The legislation also pulled funding from programs such as Solar For All, which provided millions to help low-income communities adopt clean energy solutions.

What they’re saying: Supporters of eliminating the incentives argue that the tax credit was inflating the price of solar. A report by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) examined the issue of solar financing. In April 2024, it found that some lenders include “substantial markups and fees” that can increase the loan principal by 30 percent or more above the cash price.

“Lenders frequently bake these fees (commonly referred to within the industry as ‘dealer fees’) into the loan principal but often do not indicate that these fees are a markup from the total cash price that consumers pay for the system installation.”

Those opposed to cutting the credit argue that it has been vital in supporting wider adoption of solar panels. A survey by EnergySage warned that eliminating the incentive will result in major market disruption, including job losses and shuttered small businesses.

“An overwhelming 92.3 percent of solar installers reported that cutting the tax credit would harm or dramatically harm their businesses, with nearly two-thirds expecting ‘dramatic harm.’ When asked what their first change would be if the tax credit were eliminated, almost 6 percent said they would exit the industry.”

What’s still available: Despite the cuts, Californians still have options. The federal 30% Residential Clean Energy Tax Credit remains in place for systems installed and commissioned through the end of 2025. Commercial projects can still claim a 30% credit if they begin construction by July 2026.

At the state level, the California Public Utilities Commission’s Self-Generation Incentive Program (SGIP) has $280 million in funding for residential solar and storage in disadvantaged communities. The Disadvantaged Communities – Single-Family Solar Homes (DAC-SASH) program is another resource that continues to help qualifying low-income households.

California also maintains its property tax exclusion for solar, ensuring rooftop systems do not increase homeowners’ tax bills.

Even with policy headwinds, large-scale projects across Redlands, Loma Linda and San Bernardino show how institutions have used solar to cut costs, build resilience and reduce emissions. For households and smaller businesses, the question now is how many opportunities remain before the incentives disappear.",https://www.communityforwardredlands.com/content/images/2025/09/Rooftop-Solar-Install_zstockphotos.png,N,,2025-09-18 05:58:09.156992
,EVs,2025-09-18 00:29:11+00:00,Denver Gazette,End of federal EV subsidies will hurt Colorado sales - Denver Gazette,Scott Weiser,,,,,https://www.denvergazette.com/2025/09/17/end-of-federal-ev-subsidies-will-hurt-colorado-sales/,"“Newly released data … shows that in the 3rd quarter of 2024, Colorado passed California to become the top state in the country for EV sales,” the office said in a December 2024 news release.
The Colorado Energy Office reported in July that in the first quarter of 2025, EV sales remained strong at 26% of total automobile sales.
The 2023 Colorado EV Plan from the Energy Office, Department of Transportation, and Public Health and Environment, wants to see a near-100% light-duty EV market share by 2050.
But we do believe that, unlike other states, there will continue to be an electric vehicle market here.” He added, “At one point last year we were one-out-of-every three cars with electric.
We are estimating this year that the new vehicle market is going to be about 220,000 vehicles, and that is on the trajectory we were on prior to COVID.”","With a ticking clock on Gov. Jared Polis’ 2019 aspirations to put 940,000 electric vehicles on Colorado highways by 2030, his plan hit a major pothole when President Donald Trump ordered cancellation of the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act Clean Vehicle Tax Credits.

On Sept. 30, the federal tax credits worth up to $7,500 per purchase will vanish. The cutoff, passed by Congress in July, threatens to stall the state’s EV goals just as sales data show a pre-deadline buying frenzy that is masking deeper uncertainties in the market, according to industry experts.

The subsidy has been providing up to $7,500 for qualifying new battery electric vehicles or plug-in hybrid electric vehicles with a manufacturer’s suggested retail price up to $80,000 and up to $4,000 for used EVs priced under $25,000.

In 2024, Colorado surged ahead of California to claim the nation’s top spot for EV sales, with battery electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids capturing 25.3% of new vehicle purchases — 9,446 units in that period alone, according to the Colorado Energy Office.

“Newly released data … shows that in the 3rd quarter of 2024, Colorado passed California to become the top state in the country for EV sales,” the office said in a December 2024 news release.

But today, EV registrations have plunged 32.5%.

Polis kicked off his “ambitious plan” with an executive order upon taking office in January 2019.

He framed EVs as the backbone of Colorado’s net-zero emissions goal for transportation by 2050.

“Colorado’s national leading progress in electric vehicle adoption is a key part of our ambitious efforts to achieve net-zero emissions in transportation by 2050,” Polis stated in the December 2024 release.

The end of the Biden subsidies hits at a precarious moment for EV buyers.

Colorado’s state EV incentives have decreased from $5,000 to $3,500, effective Jan. 1, 2025. Meanwhile, the Vehicle Exchange Colorado program offers rebates of up to $6,000 to income-qualified buyers who trade in old gas-guzzlers — but only 45 such deals have closed in the third quarter of 2025 so far.

Utility subsidy programs for low-income buyers, such as Xcel Energy’s $5,500 for new EV buyers, persist but pale in comparison to the federal lifeline.

A Sept. 3 rush saw buyers flood dealerships to lock in credits via pre-deadline payments, even for post-October deliveries. Still, Matthew Groves, president of the Colorado Automobile Dealers Association, warned: “Fewer discounts will inevitably slow Colorado’s red-hot EV market.”

“So, who’s really going to suffer here is middle and lower-income Americans, because a lot of people who were buying the more expensive EVs were never using that credit in the first place,” Groves told The Denver Gazette.

Groves also said the upper-end market is largely unaffected due to income and sale price restrictions.

While Groves believes there will be a slump in EV purchases after the federal credits expire, he’s confident that the EV market in Colorado isn’t headed for disaster, rather it’s headed for an adjustment that Colorado automotive dealers have been preparing for since the change of administration at the White House.

From 2019, when EV new Colorado registrations totaled just 8,015 amid 229,000 overall sales (a 3.5% share), the market jumped to 44,378 in 2024 (20.0%). Year-over-year EV growth averaged over 50% through 2024, outpacing total automotive market expansion of 6%-8% annually.

The Colorado Energy Office reported in July that in the first quarter of 2025, EV sales remained strong at 26% of total automobile sales.

But industry professionals say that’s all likely to change come Oct. 1.

From about 25,000 EVs on roads at 2019’s end (0.46% of 5.41 million total vehicles), the fleet swelled to 183,000 by mid-2025 (3.24% of an estimated 5.65 million).

The 2023 Colorado EV Plan from the Energy Office, Department of Transportation, and Public Health and Environment, wants to see a near-100% light-duty EV market share by 2050.

A May 21, 2025 analysis by Conservation Colorado, via the Southwest Energy Efficiency Project, claims “Colorado drivers could lose as much as $5.5 billion in consumer savings over the next five years if Congress repeals the federal electric vehicle (EV) tax credits.”

That’s on top of a 2019 Energy Office study projecting $43 billion in lifetime fuel and maintenance savings through 2050 from widespread adoption.

Environment America hailed the 2024 peak in a Dec. 5 statement: “In the third quarter of 2024, 25.3% of all new vehicle sales in Colorado were EVs, propelling Colorado’s market share ahead of California’s for the first time. This is a huge win for our climate and clean air.”

However, this doesn’t accurately reflect the on-the-ground reality, where EVs make up only 3.25% of the state’s vehicle fleet — 96.75% of all vehicles on the road run on internal combustion, according to the state’s electric vehicle dashboard.

Nor, according to Gallup, is EV ownership subsantially benefiting lower-income persons making less than $40,000. The Gallup data indicates that 61% of that category would not buy an EV, and 29% might consider it. In the top income echelon of $100,000 and up, 14% own an EV, 34% might consider it in the future, and 41% would not buy one.

But Polis remains bullish.

“Colorado is a national leader in electric vehicle adoption, and I’m confident market demand for these vehicles will continue because they are fast, quiet, fun, and help protect our air quality and save Coloradans money through lower maintenance costs,” said Polis in a statement to The Denver Gazette. “Colorado consumers have shown that they want EVs. The best deal you’re going to get in a long time is the deal you’ll get before the end of September.”

Groves agrees, though he’s not as optimistic as Polis about the state mandate that EVs must eventually comprise 82% of all vehicle sales.

“No, I don’t think it’s a catastrophe. Fortunately, they gave us about three months to prepare for it, so we are getting ready for the thing to wind down,” Groves said. “We’ve been speculating about the expiration of this credit going back to the election in November. So, it will take a little bit of inventory management on dealer’s behalf. But we do believe that, unlike other states, there will continue to be an electric vehicle market here.”

He added, “At one point last year we were one-out-of-every three cars with electric. Now that might drop to one in 10, one in 15, but there will still be a percentage of people who want that vehicle, and we will still have some of them here to meet their needs. It just won’t be 82% of all cars sold.”

Groves also notes that sales of internal combustion engine vehicles have been “incredibly resilient.”

“There are a lot of things that should have torn away at the market,” Groves said. “Tariffs, interest rates, inventory shortages — and people are still buying cars at a rate that they were pre-COVID. We are estimating this year that the new vehicle market is going to be about 220,000 vehicles, and that is on the trajectory we were on prior to COVID.”",https://www.denvergazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/253c4508c05d4aae9867ccec024a8709.jpg,N,,2025-09-17 21:59:28.213263

POWELLS POINT, NC, UNITED STATES, September 17, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- S.D. Paterson Development Co. has unveiled details of the Electric Vehicle Automatic Charging Station (EVACS), a weather resistant, automated charging system intended for use in private garages, fleet facilities, and outdoor spaces. The system is designed to connect to an electric vehicle without manual cable handling, allowing drivers to park and walk away while charging begins automatically.

EVACS can be installed as a self standing or wall mounted unit and incorporates a multi voltage charger with an adjustable track to fit a range of wheelbases and tire widths. The charging head is wired for direct connect fast charging and operates independently of the vehicle’s factory installed plug receptacle, enabling manual charging when away from the station.

The charging dock is positioned between tire guides and protected by spring loaded, weather resistant covers that open and close automatically as a vehicle drives on or off. The height of the receptacle can be adjusted to suit different vehicle designs and ground clearances. The system is compatible with self parking technology and can be integrated into newly manufactured electric vehicles or retrofitted to existing models.

A companion software application provides real time updates on charging status and estimated time to full charge. Charging stops automatically when the battery reaches capacity, and the user is notified.

“Our goal with EVACS is to simplify the charging process for a wide range of electric vehicles, from passenger cars to commercial fleets,” said a spokesperson for S.D. Paterson Development Co. “By removing the need to manually connect cables, we’re aiming to make charging more seamless and adaptable to different environments.”

The EVACS design can be adapted for electric automobiles, commercial trucks, recreational vehicles, utility terrain vehicles (UTVs), and golf carts. Specifications such as size, construction, and design may change as the system progresses through development and manufacturing.

Trump reversed policies supporting electric vehicles affecting the road to clean electricity, too

JEREMY J. MICHALEK

Carnegie Mellon University

Published: September 18, 2025

(THE CONVERSATION) When Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022, it was the largest climate bill in U.S. history, with major incentives for electric vehicle production and adoption. In its wake, investment in the U.S. electric vehicle industry accelerated. But in 2025, President Donald Trump's so-called One Big Beautiful Bill Act eliminated most of the incentives, and U.S. investment collapsed.

Hitting the brakes on electric vehicles will clearly mean less progress in reducing transportation emissions and less strategic U.S. leadership in a key technology of the future. But in a new study, my colleagues at Carnegie Mellon University and I find that fewer electric vehicles will also mean less investment to clean up the electricity sector.

How we got here

U.S. electric vehicle adoption lags behind the rest of the world – especially China, which has invested heavily and strategically to dominate electric vehicle markets and supply chains and to leapfrog the historical dominance of American, European and Japanese manufacturers of vehicles powered by internal combustion engines.

Electric vehicles are much simpler to engineer, and this opened a window for China to bet big on EVs with investment, incentives and experimentation. As battery prices dropped dramatically, electric cars became real competition for gasoline cars – especially for the massive Chinese market, where buyers don't have strong prior preferences for gasoline. China now dominates the supply chain for battery materials, such as lithium, nickel, cobalt and manganese, as well as the rare earth minerals used in electric motors.

In 2022, the U.S. took action to change this trend when Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act. The law encouraged EV adoption by lowering costs to manufacturers and consumers. But it also encouraged automakers to find ways to build EVs without Chinese materials by making the largest incentives conditional on avoiding China entirely.

After the law passed, investment soared across hundreds of new battery manufacturing and material processing facilities in the U.S.

But in 2025, Congress passed and Trump signed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which eliminated most of the incentives. U.S. investment in EV-related production has collapsed.

Electric vehicles are cleaner

As a scholar of electric vehicle technology, economics, environment and policy, I have conducted numerous peer-reviewed scientific studies characterizing benefits and costs of electric vehicles over their life cycle, from production through use and end of life. When charged with clean electricity, electric vehicles are one of the few technologies in existence that can provide transportation with near-zero emissions.

With today's electricity grid, EV emissions can vary, depending on the mix of electricity generators used in the region where they are charged, driving conditions such as weather or traffic, the specific vehicles being compared, and even the timing of charging. But EVs are generally better for the climate over their life cycle today than most gasoline vehicles, even if the most efficient gas-electric hybrids are still cleaner in some locations. EVs become cleaner as the electricity grid becomes cleaner, and, importantly, it turns out that EVs can even help make the electricity grid cleaner.

This matters because transportation and electricity together make up the majority of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, and the passenger cars and light trucks that we all drive produce the majority of our transportation emissions.

In its efforts to prevent the government from regulating greenhouse gas emissions, the Trump administration is now claiming that emissions from cars and trucks are ""not meaningful"" contributors to climate change. But in reality, a technology that cleans up both transportation and electricity at the same time is a big deal.

An opportunity for cleaner electricity

Our research has found that turning away from electric vehicles does more than miss a chance to curb transportation emissions – it also misses an opportunity to make the nation's electricity supply cleaner.

In our paper, my co-authors Lily Hanig, Corey Harper and Destenie Nock and I looked at potential scenarios for electric vehicle adoption across the U.S. from now until 2050. We considered situations ranging from cases with no government policies supporting electric vehicles to cases with enough electric vehicle adoption to be on track with road maps targeting overall net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.

In each of these scenarios, we calculated how the nation's power grid and electricity generators would respond to electric vehicle charging load.

We found that when there are more electric vehicles charging, more power plants would need to be built – and because of cost competitiveness, most of those new power plants would be solar, wind, battery storage and natural gas plants, depending on the region.

Once wind and solar plants are built, they are cheaper to operate than fossil fuel plants, because utilities don't need to buy more fuel to burn to make more electricity. That cost advantage means wind and solar energy gets used first, so it can displace fossil-fuel generation even when EVs aren't charging.

A virtuous – or vicious – cycle

Our analysis reveals that what's good for climate in the transportation sector – eliminating emissions from vehicle tailpipes – is also good for climate in the power sector, supporting more investment in clean power and displacing more fossil fuel-powered generation.

As a result, encouraging electric vehicle adoption is even better for the climate than many people expected because EV charging can actually cause lower-emitting power plants to be built.

Gasoline vehicles can't last forever. The cheap oil will eventually run out. And EV batteries have gotten so cheap, with ranges now comparable to gas cars, that the global transition is already well underway. Even in the U.S., consumers are adopting more EVs as the technology improves and offers consumers more for less. The U.S. government can't single-handedly stop this transition – it can only decide how much to lead, lag or resist. Rolling back electric vehicle incentives now means higher emissions, less clean energy investment and weaker U.S. competitiveness in a crucial industry of the future.

Our findings show that slowing electric vehicle adoption doesn't just affect emissions from transportation. It also misses opportunities to help build a cleaner power sector, potentially locking the U.S. into higher emissions from its top two highest-emitting sectors – power generation and transportation – while the window to avoid the worst effects of climate change is closing.

Honda has only one EV in the market—the Prologue—yet it surged 47.9% to capture 6.4% market share.
GMC had the highest days’ supply at 139, while Toyota had the lowest at just 14 days.
On the used side of the market, the used EV days’ supply fell to 36 days (also the lowest level recorded in 2025).
The used EV days’ supply remained below ICE+ (traditional internal combustion vehicle) levels for the sixth time this year.","Cox Automotive is reporting that August saw record electric vehicle (EV) sales and rising market share in both new and used markets as buyers rushed to secure tax credits before the Inflation Reduction Act’s tax credit expiration. The company’s analysts noted strong demand, tightening inventory, and significant incentives, signaling a market shift as federal subsidies are set to come to an end in September.

According to Cox, new EV sales climbed to a record 146,332 units, which is up 14.1% month over month and 17.7% year over year, lifting market share to an all-time high of 9.9%. Thirteen brands posted their best EV sales of the year. Tesla (55,500 units) led the pack, followed by Chevrolet (12,191), Ford (10,414), Hyundai (10,186), and Honda (9,347). Of note, while Tesla grew modestly (3.1%), it lost four points of market share—declining to 37.9%. Honda has only one EV in the market—the Prologue—yet it surged 47.9% to capture 6.4% market share. When it comes to luxury brands, Audi had the strongest growth, up 65.1% to 7,326 units (capturing 5% market share).

Used EVs also posted strong sales. It appears that consumers are beginning to understand long-term EV ownership—modern electric vehicles are smart buys as they have fewer moving parts (about 20 compared to over 2,000 in combustion engines), thus requiring significantly less maintenance, which leads to overall greater reliability at higher mileages. On that note, Cox reports that used EV sales reached a record 40,960 units in August, which is up 22% month over month and 59% year over year (market share was pushed to a new high of 2.4%). Five manufacturers showed double-digit month-over-month growth, led by Tesla (17,164 units, 17.6%), Chevrolet (3,801 units, 17.3%), and Ford (2,456 units, 39.6%). BMW (2,031 units, 38%) and Nissan (1,888 units, 21.6%) rounded out the top five.

“Days supply” is a key metric in the automotive industry. It is used to estimate the number of days it will take to sell the current inventory at the current sales pace. Low days supply means vehicles are selling quickly and demand is strong, while a high days supply indicates sales are slow or dealers are carrying too much inventory—consumers may be wary.

Cox is reporting that new EV days’ supply fell sharply to 62 days, down 32.1% month over month and 42.8% year over year (the lowest level recorded in 2025). Supply dropped 71 days from the June peak of 133 days, and most brands saw notable declines. GMC had the highest days’ supply at 139, while Toyota had the lowest at just 14 days. Audi posted the most significant drop, falling 104 days to end the month at 67 days.

On the used side of the market, the used EV days’ supply fell to 36 days (also the lowest level recorded in 2025). The used EV days’ supply remained below ICE+ (traditional internal combustion vehicle) levels for the sixth time this year. Cox analysts noted that supply levels vary significantly by make and model. Tesla had the lowest days’ supply at 26 days, with Chevrolet (32 days) and Nissan (32 days) also showing low levels. In contrast, Rivian (65 days), Ford (62 days), and GMC (58 days) had the highest levels, each hovering around a two-month supply. (Note: Tesla and Rivian’s supply measures reflect only vehicles available through traditional dealerships, not models offered directly by the company.)

“As we approach the sunset of the IRA tax credit, we expect September to mirror August’s elevated sales activity, driven by time-sensitive purchase and lease offers,” said the experts at Cox. “This final stretch of policy-driven urgency will likely sustain momentum across both the new and used EV segments. The market’s ability to respond to real-time demand and pricing dynamics will be crucial as incentives taper and inventory remains tight, shaping performance through the remainder of the year.”",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/68885f7f3a1fd1e919f75109/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,N,,2025-09-17 20:00:08.189949

The NAS, a non-governmental nonprofit set up to advise the government on science, said human activity is releasing greenhouse gases that are warming the planet, increasing extreme temperatures and changing the oceans, all dangerous developments for the health and welfare of the United States public. Evidence to that effect has only grown stronger since 2009, the group said.

In July, the Trump administration proposed revoking what’s known as the 2009 “endangerment” finding, the concept that climate change is a threat. Overturning it could pave the way for cutting a range of rules that limit pollution from cars, power plants and other sources.

“EPA’s 2009 finding that the human-caused emissions of greenhouse gases threaten human health and welfare was accurate, has stood the test of time, and is now reinforced by even stronger evidence,” the NAS said. Science that was uncertain or tentative in 2009 has now been resolved, it said, and new risks have been found, too.

The NAS was established in 1863 under President Abraham Lincoln and has played a significant public role in scientific policy for more than a century, including consulting on the Clean Air Act.

“The importance of getting the science right weighed heavily on the committee’s deliberations, given the potential significant implications of a changing climate and of the actions proposed to address it,” NAS committee chair and former Princeton University President Shirley Tilghman wrote in the preface to Wednesday’s report.

“Unlike earthquakes and volcanoes, over which we have no control, responding to the potential harm to human health and welfare from changes in the climate is actionable now,” Tilghman wrote.

The Trump administration looks to undo more than a decade of regulations

Under President Donald Trump, the Department of Energy has suggested that climate models used by scientists to predict warming have overreached, that long-term trends for disasters generally don’t show much change and that climate has little impact on the economy. The DOE also said there are advantages to a world with more carbon, like increased plant growth.

On Wednesday, the National Academy had a series of scientists explain their findings in a webcast.

Addressing the administration’s assertion that U.S. wildfires aren’t more common recently than they were in the 1980s, the NAS provided evidence that climate change has worsened them. Earlier springs; longer, dry summers; and cumulative drought have lengthened the fire window and raised the probability of large, fast-spreading fires, especially in the West, the NAS report said.

And while Trump’s Department of Energy attributes rising sea levels in part to sinking land and other factors, it relied on only a few tidal stations to inform its analysis, said NAS co-author Charles Driscoll, a Syracuse engineering professor.

Data from all the stations, plus from satellites, shows “very, very strong” evidence that the rise in sea levels is accelerating, Driscoll said.

In a statement, EPA said the endangerment finding was used by the Obama and Biden administrations to justify “trillions of dollars of greenhouse gas regulations” and that many of the “extremely pessimistic predictions and assumptions EPA relied upon have not materialized as expected.”

The Trump administration’s work has already been met by strong pushback from the scientific community, including dozens of experts who responded to a survey from The Associated Press. The vast majority of respondents were highly critical of science the administration put forward as it argued to revoke the endangerment finding. Many described it as filled with errors, bias and distortion.

Paul Higgins, an associate executive director of the American Meteorological Society, said the NAS’s work is trustworthy in part because of the rigorous scientific process it uses.

“The National Academy of Sciences is the premier scientific organization in the United States,” said Paulina Jaramillo, a Carnegie Mellon University professor of engineering and public policy. “In contrast, the DOE report was authored by five scientists known to be climate skeptics.”

A battle with mainstream science

Other mainstream groups have also criticized the administration’s work. A group of 85 climate experts found it “full of errors, and not fit to inform policy making.” Environmental groups are already challenging the administration’s documents in court.

A White House spokesperson previously told The Associated Press that the Trump administration “is producing Gold Standard Science research driven by verifiable data” and that the endangerment finding had long been misused to justify expensive regulations “that have jeopardized our economic and national security.”

The Trump administration maintains that while climate change is real, its future effects are unclear and likely weaker than projected by many mainstream scientists. The administration also contends that U.S. cuts in greenhouse gas emissions, which largely come from burning fuels like oil and coal, would mean little globally.

The authors of the Department of Energy report said in August that any errors found in the work would be corrected and that the report is not meant to be a comprehensive review of climate science. They said the report was intended to focus on topics that have been “underreported or overlooked in media and political discussions.”

The National Academy of Sciences said in its report released Wednesday that harm to Americans from climate change is real. People are exposed to more extreme heat, air pollution and extreme weather events, just to name a sampling of the threats, NAS said. And it said the science of climate change reveals the potential for a frightening future.

“The United States faces a future in which climate-induced harm continues to worsen and today’s extremes become tomorrow’s norms,” the NAS said.

The letter from Democrats says that repealing emissions standards will have economic costs as well.

In July, the EPA proposed rescinding its 2009 Greenhouse Gas Endangerment Finding, which grants it the authority to regulate emissions from motor vehicles and engines. The changes would eliminate future emissions requirements for models, with the EPA noting it will keep in place, “regulations necessary for criteria pollutant and air toxic measurement and standards, Corporate Average Fuel Economy testing, and associated fuel economy labeling requirements.

“This is a clear abdication of EPA’s core mission to protect human health and the environment and a flagrant rejection of Congressional intent,” wrote the lawmakers, led by Rep. Doris Matsui (D-Ca.). Matsui is a co-chair of the House Sustainable Energy and Environment Coalition alongside Reps. Mike Quigley (D-Il.) and Paul Tonko (D-N.Y.), who also signed the letter.

The letter, which calls the move a “shocking new low point” for the EPA, says that curtailing emissions standards would imperil environmental and public health. On Wednesday, the independent National Academy of Sciences said it is “beyond scientific dispute” that climate change harms public health, according to the Associated Press.

“EPA must fulfill its mission to protect communities and regulate the greenhouse gas pollution that causes these deaths,” the Democrats’ letter said.

Under Zeldin, who President Trump appointed as administrator, the EPA has prioritized removing regulations it deems harmful for businesses. In March, Zeldin announced the agency would roll back 31 environmental rules, including the 2009 endangerment finding.

“Alongside President Trump, we are living up to our promises to unleash American energy, lower costs for Americans, revitalize the American auto industry, and work hand-in-hand with our state partners to advance our shared mission,” Zeldin said at the time.

The public comment period for the proposed rescission of the endangerment finding ends on Sept. 22. Last Friday, the EPA also proposed repealing requirements for companies to report emissions, a policy implemented under the 2009 Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program.

The letter from Democrats says that repealing emissions standards will have economic costs as well. Noting recent job growth in the clean energy sector, the letter says that overturning emissions standards threatens American workers manufacturing clean energy vehicles while “the world is racing towards a zero-emission future.”

The EPA’s changes will also increase the cost of living for consumers and boost the U.S.’s reliance on foreign oil, the letter states.

“Every American deserves to breathe clean air. Every American deserves the opportunity of a prosperous future free from climate change. And every American should be able to drive an affordable next-generation clean vehicle made here in America,” the letter concludes.

When reached for comment, the EPA said it will review the letter and “respond through the appropriate channels.”

“The agency looks forward to responding to a diverse array of perspectives on this issue,” the EPA added.

(NASDAQ:GPRE), a $637.3 million market cap renewable fuels producer, has entered into an agreement with an affiliate of Freepoint Commodities LLC to sell Clean Fuel Production Credits generated in 2025 under the Inflation Reduction Act, according to a press release statement. According to InvestingPro data, the company operates with significant debt levels but maintains strong liquidity with a current ratio of 1.47.

The initial credits will come from low-carbon intensity ethanol production at Green Plains’ three Nebraska facilities. The company has also signed a term sheet with Freepoint to monetize tax credits from three additional facilities expected to qualify under the 45Z tax credit program during 2025. With current gross profit margins at 5.5%, these credits could provide important additional revenue streams for the company.

The agreement covers the anticipated 2025 production year credits for the Nebraska facilities, with the possibility of extension to purchase credits for 2026-2029 on mutually agreeable terms. The credits will be transferred through a direct transfer mechanism supported by third-party emissions verification and tax insurance.

""Our focus on operational excellence has improved utilization and yields across our platform, while also lowering carbon intensity—enabling several plants to qualify for 45Z credits during the current year,"" said Chris Osowski, Chief Executive Officer of Green Plains, in the statement.

According to the company, a portion of these credits are being generated prior to the expected launch of carbon capture later this year, which the company says demonstrates the competitive carbon intensity profile of its current operations.

Based on current expectations, the combined agreement and term sheet are projected to generate between $40 and $50 million in 2025 45Z EBITDA net of discounts and after applicable operating expenses, with the first credits being recorded in the third quarter. This projection is significant considering the company’s current EBITDA of $23.47M. InvestingPro’s Fair Value analysis suggests the stock is currently undervalued, with additional insights available in the comprehensive Pro Research Report covering this and 1,400+ other US equities.

The final proceeds will depend on actual production and the timing of startup for the carbon capture systems at Green Plains’ Nebraska facilities. Despite recent challenges, the stock has shown remarkable momentum with an 84.29% return over the past six months.

""Georgia is very active — they're having great success with their rebate program,"" David Terry, president of the National Association of State Energy Officials, told Utility Dive.
These rebates can be allocated for a number of uses, but few are as exciting as an induction stove.
Sadly, the $8,000 available through HOMES doesn't mean you can get an $8,000 stove for free.
However, it would allow an induction stove to be part of a larger home upgrade that could qualify for the rebate.","Although some federal tax credits for environmentally friendly home upgrades will expire at the end of this year, there is still money available for those homeowners who want to make energy-efficient improvements.

As Utility Dive reported, a dozen states have already launched rebate programs with funds originally allocated through the Inflation Reduction Act, and all states except South Dakota have applied for funding.

Despite the budget bill that was signed into law this summer, the $4.3 billion made available for the Home Efficiency Rebates program, or HOMES, is expected to remain until Sept. 30, 2031, or until the money runs out. This program allows homeowners to get up to $8,000 off projects that ""significantly reduce"" energy usage.

""Georgia is very active — they're having great success with their rebate program,"" David Terry, president of the National Association of State Energy Officials, told Utility Dive. ""Indiana had their program negotiated and approved just before the new administration took office, and launched [in May], and that seems to be going well. And certainly the other states, they're going through the funds pretty quickly.""

Many other states, Terry added, are just waiting on final approval from the Department of Energy.

These rebates can be allocated for a number of uses, but few are as exciting as an induction stove.

By using a magnetic current to generate heat, instead of burning dirty fuels like natural gas, induction stoves manage to boil water faster than gas, without producing any of the toxic fumes. They also stay cool to the touch, making them safer and easier to clean, and are more energy-efficient, so they cost less to operate.

Sadly, the $8,000 available through HOMES doesn't mean you can get an $8,000 stove for free. However, it would allow an induction stove to be part of a larger home upgrade that could qualify for the rebate. Otherwise, another similar program, the Home Electrification and Appliance Rebate, allows for up to $840 off such a cooktop.

If purchasing a new stove isn't in the cards right now, you can still take advantage of induction technology. Plug-in burners offer many of the same benefits as a full stove but can fit on a countertop, making them a perfect choice for renters or those on a budget. The price can also fit into most budgets, as they start at just $50.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/rebate-programimage-recxEsUggDBUzCFSZ.jpg,N,,2025-09-17 22:00:38.182118

The ceremonial event, held on September 16, 2025, near Social Circle, marks a pivotal step for the company as it pushes forward with plans to scale production of its next-generation vehicles. Attended by Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe, Georgia Governor Brian Kemp, and other local leaders, the groundbreaking underscores the state’s growing role as a hub for EV manufacturing, bolstered by substantial incentives and federal support.

The factory, slated to become Rivian’s “global manufacturing hub,” will eventually produce up to 400,000 vehicles annually, focusing initially on the midsize R2 SUV and the compact R3 crossover. According to details shared in a report from TechCrunch, while the event was largely symbolic, it paves the way for actual construction to commence in early 2026, with vehicle production targeted for 2028. This timeline reflects adjustments from Rivian’s original 2021 announcement, which envisioned operations starting as early as 2024 but was derailed by supply-chain disruptions, rising costs, and a broader slowdown in EV demand.

Navigating Economic Uncertainties and Federal Backing in EV Expansion

Rivian’s path to this milestone has not been without challenges. The project paused in March 2024 amid financial strains, only to resume following a strategic pivot that included a $5 billion investment from Volkswagen AG and the finalization of a $6.6 billion loan from the U.S. Department of Energy. As noted in coverage by WebProNews, this DOE funding, secured just before shifts in federal administration, provides critical capital for infrastructure development, including deep utilities installation set for August 2025 and vertical construction in the following year. Industry analysts view this as a bet on long-term growth, despite current market softness where EV sales have plateaued amid high interest rates and competition from hybrids.

Beyond production capacity, the Georgia plant promises significant economic ripple effects. Rivian has committed to creating 7,500 jobs by 2030, a boon for the region east of Atlanta. A piece in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution highlighted the community’s anticipation, with hundreds attending a pre-groundbreaking event to learn about the facility’s environmental features, such as sustainable building practices and integration with local ecosystems. Georgia’s $1.5 billion incentive package, including tax breaks and infrastructure grants, has been instrumental in reviving the project, positioning the state competitively against EV hotspots like Michigan and Tennessee.

Strategic Implications for Rivian’s Market Position and Broader Industry Trends

For Rivian, the Georgia factory represents a cornerstone of its strategy to achieve profitability and compete with giants like Tesla Inc. and Ford Motor Co. The R2 and R3 models, priced starting around $45,000, aim to broaden Rivian’s appeal beyond its premium R1T truck and R1S SUV, targeting a mass-market segment. Insights from Electrek emphasize how this expansion could help Rivian navigate policy uncertainties, including potential rollbacks of federal EV tax credits under evolving administrations. The company’s stock rose 6% following the announcement, as reported by Investing.com, reflecting investor optimism about scaled operations reducing per-unit costs.

Yet, challenges loom. The EV industry faces headwinds from slowing global demand and supply-chain vulnerabilities, with Rivian reporting losses in recent quarters. As detailed in Yahoo Finance, the project’s success hinges on Rivian’s ability to ramp up efficiently while managing capital expenditures. Insiders note that partnerships, like the one with Volkswagen for software and zonal architecture, could accelerate innovation at the new site.

Looking Ahead: Job Creation, Sustainability, and Competitive Edge in American Manufacturing

Looking forward, Rivian’s Georgia endeavor could reshape U.S. auto manufacturing by emphasizing domestic production and reducing reliance on overseas suppliers. The facility’s design incorporates advanced automation and renewable energy sources, aligning with broader sustainability goals. Coverage in MarketScreener describes it as accelerating American manufacturing growth, with potential to generate ancillary jobs in logistics and technology.

Ultimately, this groundbreaking is more than a photo op—it’s a declaration of Rivian’s resilience in a volatile market. As the company transitions from startup to scaled producer, the Georgia plant will test its vision against real-world economics, potentially setting a blueprint for other EV makers eyeing U.S. expansion. With construction on the horizon, stakeholders will watch closely for milestones that could solidify Rivian’s place in the electric future.",https://www.webpronews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/xai-tmp-imgen-0df1a975-f387-409e-a258-2c785d43e44e.jpeg,N,,2025-09-17 19:59:43.370137

It also highlights the power of cross-functional teamwork—bringing together legal experts, utility rate expert witnesses, energy managers, and on-site REMs to drive results.
“This wasn’t just a win for Fort Johnson,” Spang said.","REDSTONE ARSENAL, Ala. — In an era of tight budgets and rising costs, the U.S. Army is finding smart ways to stretch every dollar.

Thanks to the collaboration between two programs at the U.S. Army Engineering and Support Center in Huntsville, Fort Johnson, Louisiana, just scored a massive win—recouping nearly $974,000 in utility overpayments and unlocking projected savings of more than $2.3 million annually.

Home to the Joint Readiness Training Center (JRTC)—where warfighters prepare for global missions—Fort Johnson had for years been billed under a utility rate plan meant for small businesses. This unfortunate situation resulted in significantly higher electricity costs. But now, that’s all changing.

Huntsville Center’s Commercial Utility Program (CUP) teamed up with Fort Johnson to perform a utility bill audit to identify electric cost savings. Years earlier, a prior audit identified the problematic electric rate, but a better rate was not available, and the Army could not pursue the issue until the power provider filed a rate case requesting an increase in rates – something not done since 2013.

However, days after the utility bill audit contract was awarded, Christina Spang, CUP project manager, discovered local power provider Entergy Louisiana had filed a rate case before the Louisiana Public Service Commission (LPSC) requesting permission to increase electric rates for the first time in 10 years.

This was the moment the Army had been waiting for.

CUP immediately notified Army Legal Services Agency’s Environmental Law Division (USALSA-ELD) and an Army Regulatory attorney immediately filed a rate intervention before the LPSC on behalf of Fort Johnson, just in time to meet the tight filing deadline.

What was subsequently found by the Army Legal team was eye-opening: Fort Johnson had been overcharged millions of dollars over the course of 10 years due to being misclassified under a “Small General Service Rate Schedule” by Entergy Louisiana.

To navigate the complex world of utility regulations and Time-of-Use rate modeling, CUP brought in Ph.D.-level expert witnesses to support Army Legal during the rate intervention. But even the most qualified experts needed help gathering key data.

That’s where Jeffrey Rodgers, Fort Johnson’s Energy Manager, and Scott Pogue, a Resource Efficiency Manager (REM) contracted through Huntsville Center’s REM program, came in.

Pogue served as a vital link between the Fort Johnson team and CUP, supplying the detailed technical data needed to justify the rate change. His on-site expertise in energy planning and efficiency made him a driving force in the success of the initiative.

“REM’s like Pogue are our boots-on-the-ground experts,” said John Trudell, Huntsville Center REM program manager.

“They bring immediate, practical insight to energy infrastructure and help installations unlock real savings.”

Thanks to this collaboration, Fort Johnson not only received a $973,948.72 rebate for three months of overbilling—but is also expected to save an estimated $1.9 million per year going forward, primarily due to switching to a Large General Service Rate Schedule.

That’s not all. Over the next 35 years, Fort Johnson is estimated to save an additional $420,000 annually through reductions in the Additional Facilities Charges tied to its utility privatization contract – a total of $9.2 million in net present value savings.

In total, Fort Johnson will save an estimated $11.5 million from the success of this rate case.

“These savings are permanent,” Spang said. “By switching from a rate schedule designed for small businesses to one suitable for a large Army installation, Fort Johnson is now being billed equitably—and that means millions of dollars back into the Army’s budget.”

This case marks one of CUP’s most successful utility rate interventions to date. It also highlights the power of cross-functional teamwork—bringing together legal experts, utility rate expert witnesses, energy managers, and on-site REMs to drive results.

“This wasn’t just a win for Fort Johnson,” Spang said.

“It’s a win for the American taxpayer, and a demonstration of how cross-functional Army teams from different Commands and Programs can work together seamlessly on behalf of Army installations to accomplish major cost savings.”",https://api.army.mil/e2/c/images/2025/05/19/cdc6e360/max1200.jpg,N,,2025-09-17 19:01:05.095329

Dangerous flooding also threatens Maryland communities further inland as heavy precipitation and severe storms have become more common.
We urge you to put the welfare of people over that of polluters and maintain the Endangerment Finding.","WASHINGTON – Today, U.S. Representatives Johnny Olszewski, Steny Hoyer, Kweisi Mfume, Jamie Raskin, Glenn Ivey, Sarah Elfreth, and April McClain Delaney and U.S. Senators Chris Van Hollen and Angela Alsobrooks (all D-Md.) urged the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to maintain its greenhouse gas emissions “endangerment finding,” a 2009 landmark determination that climate pollution endangers public health and welfare. This determination – which has stood for over 15 years – provides the legal basis for regulating greenhouse gas emissions. In their letter to EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, the lawmakers called on the agency to preserve the endangerment finding in order to protect Marylanders from the increasing risks, costs, and chaos caused by climate change, pointing to the many related threats currently facing Maryland communities.

“We are deeply concerned by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) proposal to eliminate the 2009 Endangerment Finding and what that will mean for Maryland and our constituents’ health and safety. The Endangerment Finding requires the EPA to protect people from the pollution that causes climate change. Denying the danger cannot change the facts: greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels are heating our planet and endangering us all,” the lawmakers began.

“The Endangerment Finding is based on settled science: decades of peer-reviewed scientific research have proven that rising global temperatures fuel stronger hurricanes, sea level rise, increased flooding, record-breaking heat waves, and other forms of extreme weather. The threats have never been more dire to communities across the country, including our constituents in Maryland,” they wrote.

The lawmakers went on to highlight threats to Maryland communities, pointing out, “Coastal communities in the Chesapeake Bay region are especially vulnerable to rising sea levels; in this region, seas have already risen one foot over the past century, twice as fast as the worldwide average, and are projected to rise nearly 3 more feet by 2100.

“We urge you to put the welfare of people over that of polluters and maintain the Endangerment Finding. Marylanders and communities across the country should not be left to foot the bill for the climate chaos caused by polluters,” they concluded.

Dear Administrator Zeldin:

We are deeply concerned by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) proposal to eliminate the 2009 Endangerment Finding and what that will mean for Maryland and our constituents’ health and safety.

The Endangerment Finding requires the EPA to protect people from the pollution that causes climate change. Denying the danger cannot change the facts: greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels are heating our planet and endangering us all.

The Endangerment Finding is based on settled science: decades of peer-reviewed scientific research have proven that rising global temperatures fuel stronger hurricanes, sea level rise, increased flooding, record-breaking heat waves, and other forms of extreme weather. The threats have never been more dire to communities across the country, including our constituents in Maryland.

Coastal communities in the Chesapeake Bay region are especially vulnerable to rising sea levels; in this region, seas have already risen one foot over the past century, twice as fast as the worldwide average, and are projected to rise nearly 3 more feet by 2100. More than 100 Maryland communities are at risk of ‘nuisance flooding’ from sea level rise. Almost a third of those communities are socioeconomically disadvantaged and do not have the resources to adapt to or mitigate the local impacts. Annapolis and Baltimore are experiencing some of the most frequent nuisance flooding events in the country, which have increased more than 920 percent since 1960. Further, Maryland farmers are expected to lose between $39 million and $107 million annually in crop yields due to saltwater intrusion.

Dangerous flooding also threatens Maryland communities further inland as heavy precipitation and severe storms have become more common. As of August 1st, Maryland has already recorded the most flash flood warnings in 2025 since 2020. Two years after Ellicott City was hit by a 1-in-1000 year catastrophic flash flood in 2016, which took the lives of two Marylanders, damaged over 100 businesses and 107 homes costing over $22 million in repairs, and reduced economic activity by $67.2 million, another flash flood once again destroyed the city’s Main Street and led to the death of one person. Recent flooding in the Mid-Atlantic led to the death of a child swept away by flood waters and over 200 children and students being evacuated from an elementary school in motorized boats in Western Maryland. The flood damaged drinking water systems and roads, highlighting the dangers facing all Marylanders as extreme weather wreaks havoc on the state’s infrastructure and local economies.

As temperatures continue to rise, Marylanders, along with much of the rest of the nation, are threatened by heat waves of ever greater length and magnitude. Since 1900, average temperatures in Maryland have risen by roughly 2.5 ℉. During the 2024 heat season, there were 1,255 heat-related medical visits in Maryland – a 53% increase from the previous year – and 26 heat-related deaths. During the ongoing 2025 heat season, one heat wave alone in late June caused 472 people to go to urgent care or the emergency room, and resulted in 7 tragic deaths. In 2025, Maryland has already had more heat deaths than in the past 13 years, having reached 29 lives lost in mid-August. A failure to seriously curtail greenhouse gas emissions will lead to hotter average temperatures and more frequent days in which the heat index crosses 105 ℉, threatening to increase heat-related illness and death even further.

The EPA is tasked with protecting the public from air pollution that endangers health and welfare, and this politically motivated attempt to eliminate the Endangerment Finding flies in the face of that core mission. As you know, eliminating the Endangerment Finding will undermine other protections against climate pollution: clean car and truck standards, power plant rules, oil and gas rules, landfill rules, and more. This amounts to giving polluters a free pass to pollute at the expense of families in Maryland and across the country. It means our constituents will face more climate chaos and more pollution, more health harms, and higher costs – just so the corporations responsible for the climate crisis can continue to rake in record-breaking profit.

We urge you to put the welfare of people over that of polluters and maintain the Endangerment Finding. Marylanders and communities across the country should not be left to foot the bill for the climate chaos caused by polluters.

,Clean Energy ,2025-09-17 21:15:05+00:00,Heatmap News,What J.P. Morgan's Chief Climate Advisor Is Telling Energy Startups - Heatmap News,Robinson Meyer,,,,,https://heatmap.news/politics/shift-key-s3-e3-jp-morgan,"But the company, if it’s a shareholder-owned company, has one main obligation, which is to maximize the value of their shares.
And so Trump is fast-tracking mines, he’s sending huge amounts of public money to financially underwrite these mining companies.
With lithium, it’s even clearer.
So in a weird way, they like lithium mining, they like batteries for storage, they just don’t like electric vehicles.
Between 2005 and 2023, per capita emissions from primary energy consumption decreased in every U.S. state, with an average drop of 30%, even as the American population grew by 14%, according to a new analysis by the U.S. Energy Information Administration.","Riofrancos, a professor at Providence College, has spent much of her academic career studying mining and oil production in Latin America. In Extraction, she traces the lithium boom of the past five or so years, as the aims of the Global North and Global South began to resemble an inverted mirror. Countries in the latter group that have long been sites of mineral extraction — with little economic benefit — are now seeking to manufacture the more lucrative high tech products further down the supply chain. Meanwhile, after decades of offshoring, Europe and the U.S. suddenly want to bring mining back home in pursuit of “green dominance,” she writes. All of this is happening against the backdrop of China’s geopolitical rise, the war in Ukraine, the COVID-19 pandemic, and worsening effects of climate change.

The book also spends time with the indigenous communities and environmental defenders fighting the lithium industry in Chile, Spain, and the American West. Riofrancos doesn’t shy away from difficult questions, such as whether there is such a thing as a “right place” for a lithium mine. But she’s optimistic that there’s a better path than the one we’re on now. “The energy transition has presented a fork in the road for the entire economic and social order,” she writes. Down one road, we entrench existing power structures. Down the other, we capitalize on the energy transition to create a more just society.

Green capitalism, Riofrancos argues, is an oxymoron. While we can’t avoid extraction, we can reduce the need for it, for example through better public transit, smaller EV batteries, and minerals recycling, she concludes.

This interview has been edited and condensed for length and clarity.

Are there notable differences between lithium and the extraction of other natural resources?

Yes and no. Whether it’s copper or lithium or gold or cobalt — and even I would include hydrocarbons in this, to a degree — whether we look at the economics, the way that they have boom and bust cycles, the fact that governments, even neoliberal governments, tend to take a pretty concerted interest in extractive sectors within their jurisdiction, environmental concerns and direct forms of violence that are meted out at environmental defenders — no, it’s not different. Which should raise alarm bells because a lot of those dynamics are not positive.

What’s different, though, is that precisely because mining companies and host governments claim that the extraction of lithium is urgent and essential for the energy transition, what ends up happening is that these big claims are made — like, “We are now a sustainable mining company because we’re extracting lithium,” or, “This is part of our green industrial policy.” This toxic and dirty extractive sector is now greenified because of its role in the energy transition. On the one hand, that’s greenwashing. On the other, it’s an opening. When companies make those claims, it’s something to hold them accountable to.

I was somewhat surprised by the issues you describe with the way lithium mining is regulated in Chile — the companies do their own environmental monitoring, there’s a lack of transparent data, the brine they mine in the Atacama is not considered water under Chilean law, etc. It seems like the state could change a lot of this. Why hasn’t it?

States in the Global South, although not exclusively there, lack geological and hydrological data about their own territory. In ways that we can trace to colonialism and neocolonialism in terms of who controls the territory and who has knowledge about it, the actors that have the basic data about deposits, how they interact with water sources, all of that, are the companies. And so to even regulate these companies better, you first need to set up independent and objective sources of data collection — and that’s something that any state might struggle with, but especially in the Global South, given the kind of legacy under which these companies operated, with little oversight of the state.

The [U.S. Geological Survey] doesn’t exist everywhere in the world. Not every state has a surveying agency with that level of expertise. And even in the U.S., the USGS actually has quite partial knowledge of what’s here. And there are many examples of companies in the U.S. hiding proprietary knowledge from the government.

What about after Gabriel Boric became president in Chile, in 2022, and created this new public-private partnership between the mining giant SQM and the government. Wouldn’t that have given the Chilean government more visibility and more control?

I think in some ways he’s made strides. He has set aside many salt flats for conservation. A right wing government wouldn’t have done that. He also is inserting the state, via the state-owned copper company Codelco, entering into public-private partnerships with companies, including SQM. If all goes according to plan, that will help the state learn more about lithium extraction, or maybe even set up their own lithium company, which was the initial goal of this government.

I’ll just point out two things to show how this is difficult. According to indigenous communities and environmental activists that have been organizing around this, they were excluded from the initial moment where that memorandum of understanding between SQM and Codelco was signed, and so they felt like it was a reenactment of historic injuries by a government that they had cautiously supported or thought would be different. Now they’re back at the negotiating table and indigenous communities are being consulted again. But there was a critical moment where the MOU was signed and indigenous communities were not present, and actually learned about it from the media. These historic patterns are really hard to change because companies hold a lot of power.

Even a progressive government is balancing indigenous rights and ecological protection with a desire to not lose market share. Argentina is starting to catch up with Chile — is Chile still going to remain the number two producer globally? Does it need to change its regulations to attract more companies? This is the kind of double bind that Global South societies find themselves in.

You write about this tension between expanding extraction and minimizing environmental and community impacts. Do you believe there are actually ways to minimize these impacts?

Absolutely. You can do anything better. I believe in human ingenuity and science and figuring out how to improve processes. There are ways to extract using less water, using a smaller land footprint, using fewer polluting energy sources. One of the reasons emissions from mining are not insignificant is a lot of it happens off-grid, and for now, that means diesel generators or gasoline-powered mining vehicles, let alone the cargo ships that are shipping the stuff around the world. So we could think about localizing or regionalizing supply chains.

The question is, how do we get companies to change their practices? They might do it if a regulator tells them they have to, if civil society puts so much pressure on them that it just becomes reputational harm if they don’t do it, if perhaps activist shareholders ask or tell the company to change its practices.

But the company, if it’s a shareholder-owned company, has one main obligation, which is to maximize the value of their shares. Changing your technological setup and your physical plant arrangement is costly, and it may not immediately produce more profits. And so you have to think about, what are the crude economic dynamics that keep companies on a particular technological path in terms of how they do their physical operations? And then think, using the power of policy, of economics, of consumer pressure, whatever it is, how to get them to make a decision that may not be in their immediate shareholder interest.

One theme in the book is that countries in the West are making a case for domestic mining by arguing that it will be greener than mining in the Global South. Is there any evidence for that? What’s the logic?

This was honestly one of the most surprising things in my research as someone that primarily has worked in Latin America. I heard some rumblings — and this was in 2019, before the pandemic — of EU officials wanting to onshore. It confused me because mining is toxic, it’s low value-added. And what I learned is that it had come to a point where Western policymakers saw the whole supply chain as a domain of geostrategic power.

And then, probably some people really feel this way, and other people are using it as nice rhetoric, but Western policymakers also started to come to the idea that it would be more “responsible” to mine in the West. This is in no small part due to the fact that the mining industry has deservedly gotten a lot of negative coverage for, in some cases, outright killing people. In other cases, you have an avalanche that destroys a village. You have water contamination. There are issues around forced labor, how the Uyghurs are treated in China. So there was a lot of bad press on the industry. I think they thought, We can solve a few problems at once. We can increase our geopolitical power by having domestic supply chains for the most important 21st century technologies, and we can also make the claim to consumers, regulators, and the media that this is better if you care about responsible, ethical, green mining.

The reality is, of course, more complex than that. Our mining law in the U.S. that governs hard rock mining on public lands is from 1872, which tells you everything you need to know. It’s extremely out of date with the modern mining industry and the scale of harm that mining poses, and it also literally was implemented during the westward expansion and dispossession of indigenous peoples to serve that end.

In fact, countries in Latin America tend to have better — on paper — governance of mining than the U.S., though they may not have the state capacity to always implement it. In Europe, there’s even more dependence on imports. A lot of the European countries have almost no regulations on the books for basic things like, how do you deal with mining waste? And so in the Global North, what we have to fight for is a mining governance regime and a set of legal codes and regulations that is up to date.

This book is pretty critical of the way communities have been treated in the lithium boom so far. What are some of the ways community engagement can be done better?

We see better outcomes when communities are organized, when they actually identify as a community, have some meetings, maybe set up a group to coordinate themselves. Like, who’s going to go to the public hearing? Who’s going to contact a lawyer? Who’s going to contact the water expert? Because communities need a lot of outside help. The companies have lawyers, they have experts, they probably have friends in government. A lot of lawyers and experts that companies hire used to work for the government, and they know these processes inside out, and so the community needs to be as or more organized. They’re already on the losing end of a power imbalance.

In a way, none of this is about what companies can do, because I presume that companies are responsive to pressure. Multinationals, insofar as they’re shareholder-owned, their main goal is to maximize value, and that’s it. It’s that simple. And so in order to get them to behave differently towards communities, outside forces need to take a role. The first outside force is the community itself. A second is, how involved is the government? And how objective and public-serving is the government? Where governments take a more objective role and help protect the baseline rights of communities, make sure that those rights are not being violated by companies, help distribute more culturally sensitive and appropriate information about the mine, we could get better outcomes that way.

You had activists tell you, “I support lithium mining, but this is the wrong place for it.” Do you think there is such a thing as a right or wrong place, or even a better or worse place for a lithium mine?

This was honestly the most vexing question that I had to contemplate in my own research. I often think about how these communities are called NIMBYs, and there’s two reasons that’s a really inappropriate term. First of all, the “my backyard” — not every person has private property, or that’s not their stake in the matter. It’s not about, this is going to decrease the value of my property, or this is going to disrupt my ocean view. It’s about the land that they have a deep relationship with.

The second thing is, I don’t think most of the people that call these communities NIMBYs would really want to live next to a large-scale mine, either. They are just enormous scars on the landscape. I understand that they are necessary, to some degree, to provide for the technologies that we enjoy, including life-saving and planet-saving technology. Even in my perfect world, where everyone is riding an electric bus or bike or walking around, some lithium is still needed in the near term. In the future, we could conceivably enter into a circular economy, but we don’t have the level of feedstock for that yet.

So the question remains, where are we going to mine? I don’t have an easy answer to that, but I will say that in the entire process of land use planning, the corporation is the protagonist. In the U.S., a place that I think most political scientists would say has more state capacity than a country in Africa or Latin America, we do not use that capacity to proactively plan land use. I think it would make sense to really rearrange the process such that governments plan with substantial community input, and then corporations, if we want to have private corporations doing this, get the ability to compete for contracts. I know that would be a big lift to change that policy dynamic, but I think we need to have the conversation.

You write a lot about this difficult dance between supply and demand in mining. What are you seeing right now in how the lithium industry is reacting to Trump’s dismantling of EV policy?

With Trump, it’s particularly interesting and bizarre because on the list of fast-tracked mines, you have several lithium mines and some lithium processing along with other “critical minerals.” He really wants to expand mining, to the point that the Pentagon is now the No. 1 investor in our only rare earth mine in the U.S. They bought 15% of MP Materials’ shares, the company that manages the Mountain Pass mine. And so Trump is fast-tracking mines, he’s sending huge amounts of public money to financially underwrite these mining companies. But yet, he’s destroying demand for rare earths. He loves to talk about AI and military tech — that’s a small slice of demand. It’s really about wind turbines and electric vehicle motors. That’s really where the demand is. With lithium, it’s even clearer.

That all seems like a recipe for prices to crash.

The thing is, they already had crashed because of a supply glut. But at the same time, the market will likely pick back up because we’re seeing so much action elsewhere in the world. It’s very easy to focus on the U.S., especially because the U.S. government is such a basket case right now. But if we zoom out, there’s been a bunch of recent reporting, including in Heatmap, on how rapidly the energy transition is going in other parts of the world, with China playing an enormous role not only on the trade side, but also in foreign direct investment, in setting up solar and EV manufacturing hubs in the Global South.

And so I think that Trump can dismantle EVs as much as he wants in the U.S., and that’s a shame given that transportation is our most polluting sector. I mean, that pains me as a climate activist. But the world is bigger than the U.S.

The last thing I’ll say — and this is another interesting contradiction — in the Big, Beautiful Bill, it’s not across the board against all green technologies. There’s this distinction that conservatives increasingly like to make called “clean, firm power.” So they put nuclear, geothermal, and battery storage in that. Now, battery storage, what is that made of? Lithium. So in a weird way, they like lithium mining, they like batteries for storage, they just don’t like electric vehicles. We’re still going to have lithium demand in the U.S., and lots of individual people will still buy electric cars, and blue states will still procure them for their public fleets. He’s not going to kill the market. He’s just going to slow its growth, primarily by making it less affordable for working and middle class people.

THE TOP FIVE

1. Orsted sells new shares at a steep discount

Orsted is offering investors a nearly 70% discount on the new shares issued to raise money to save its American offshore wind projects amid the Trump administration’s aggressive crackdown on the industry. The Danish energy giant won nearly unanimous approval from its shareholders earlier this month for a rights issue aimed at raising $9.4 billion. Shares in the company, which is half owned by the government in Copenhagen, closed around $32 each on Friday. But the offering of 901 million new shares came at a subscription rate of about $10.50 each. Orsted’s projects in the northeastern U.S. already “struggled” with what The Wall Street Journal listed as “supply-chain bottlenecks, higher interest rates, and trouble getting tax credits,” which culminated in the restructuring last year that saw the company “pull out of two high-profile wind projects off the coast of New Jersey.”

The offshore wind industry, as I noted in yesterday’s newsletter, is just starting to fight back. The owners of the Rhode Island offshore project Revolution Wind, which Trump halted unilaterally, filed a lawsuit claiming the administration illegally withdrew its already-finalized permits. After the administration filed a lawsuit to revoke the permits of US Wind’s big project off Maryland’s coast, the company said it intends “to vigorously defend those permits in federal court, and we are confident that the court will uphold their validity and prevent any adverse action against them.” But the multi-agency assault on offshore turbine projects has only escalated in recent months, as the timeline Heatmap’s Emily Pontecorvo produced shows. And Orsted is facing other headwinds. The company just warned investors of lower profits this year after weaker-than-forecast wind speeds reduced the output of its turbines.

2. Toyota halts U.S. EV sales amid recall of nearly 600,000 vehicles

Toyota issued a voluntary recall for some 591,000 Toyota and Lexus cars over a slight glitch in the display screen. The 12.3-inch screen could fail to turn on after the car started, or go black while driving. Toyota said it will begin notifying owners if affected vehicles by mid-November. The move came just days after the Japanese auto giant — which owns both its eponymous passenger car brand and the associated luxury line, Lexus — recalled 62,000 electric vehicles, including the Toyota bZ4X SUV and the Lexus RZ300e sedan and its luxury SUV, the RZ450. Subaru, in which Toyota owns a minority stake, is also recalling its electric SUV, the Solterra. With all four EVs, the issue revolved around a faulty windshield defroster that “may not remove frost, ice and/or fog from the windshield glass due to a software issue in the electrical control unit,” the company said in a press release..

3. Americans’ per-capita energy emissions fell in every state

States such as Mississippi and Idaho had the lowest drop in energy-related per-capita emissions.EIA

Americans who complain that the U.S. should bear less responsibility for mitigating climate change like to point out that China produces far more planet-heating emissions per year, and that India is not far behind. The cumulative nature of carbon in the atmosphere makes for an easy rebuke, since the U.S. and Western Europe are overwhelmingly responsible for the emissions of the past two centuries. But a less historically abstract response could be that Americans still have by far the highest per capita emissions of any large country. That doesn’t mean the U.S. isn’t making progress on a per capita level, though. Between 2005 and 2023, per capita emissions from primary energy consumption decreased in every U.S. state, with an average drop of 30%, even as the American population grew by 14%, according to a new analysis by the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The dip is largely thanks to the electric power sector burning less coal. Increased electricity generation from natural gas, which releases about half as much carbon per unit of energy when burned as coal, and the growth of renewables such as wind and solar have reduced the need for the dirtier fuel. But the EIA forecasts that overall U.S. emissions are set to climb by 1% as electricity demand increases.

For those keen to shrink their individual carbon output at a much faster pace than American society at large, Heatmap’s award-winning Decarbonize Your Life series walks through the benefits and drawbacks to driving less, eating less steak, installing solar panels, and renovating homes to be more energy efficient.

4. Sierra Club names new leader

Following rebellions from various state chapters, the Sierra Club terminated its executive director, Ben Jealous, last month, as I reported here in this newsletter at the time. Now the group has named its new leader: Loren Blackford. The Sierra Club veteran, who served in various senior roles before taking on the interim executive director job last month, won unanimous support from the group’s board of directors on Saturday.

Jealous had previously served as a chief executive of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and the 2018 Democratic nominee for Maryland governor before becoming the first non-white leader of the 133-year-old Sierra Club. His appointment marked a symbolic turning of the page from the group’s early chapters under its founder, John Muir, who made numerous derogatory remarks about Black and Native Americans. Jealous was accused of sexual harassment earlier this year.

5. Thermal battery startup Fourth Power raises $20 million

Thermal battery company Fourth Power just announced $20 million in follow-on funding, building on its $19 million Series A round from 2023. While other thermal storage companies such as Rondo and Antora are targeting the decarbonization of high-temperature industrial processes such as smelting or chemical manufacturing, Fourth Power aims to manufacture long-duration energy storage systems for utilities and power producers.

“In our view, electricity is the biggest problem that needs to be solved,” Fourth Power’s CEO Arvin Ganesan told Heatmap’s Katie Brigham. “There is certainly a future application for heat, but we don’t think that’s where to start.” The company’s tech works by taking in excess renewable electricity from the grid, which is used to heat up liquid tin to 2,400 degrees Celsius, nearly half the temperature of the sun’s surface. That heat is then stored in carbon blocks and later converted back into electricity using thermophotovoltaic cells. This latest funding will accelerate the deployment of the startup’s first one megawatt hour demonstration plant.

THE KICKER

The tropical storm that later became Hurricane María formed exactly eight years ago today and went on to lay waste to Puerto Rico’s aging electrical system. The grid remains fragile and expensive, with frequent outages and some of the highest rates in the U.S. on the hours when the power is accessible. That has spurred a boom in rooftop solar panels. Now more than 10% of the island’s electricity consumption comes from rooftop solar power. Data released by the grid operator LUMA Energy showed approximately 1.2 gigawatts of residential and commercial rooftop solar had been installed under Puerto Rico’s net-metering regulations as of June 2025. New analysis by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis found that is equal to about 10.3% of Puerto Rico’s total power consumption — and that’s not counting any off-grid systems.",https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MTYwNDYyNi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc2OTMxMjQ2Nn0.nZsWx0gf9y3K4bUjVC-60tPw7nscthtwKijwKBDeqN8/image.jpg?width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C100%2C0%2C100,N,,2025-09-17 19:59:53.096157

The initial credits will be generated from low-carbon intensity ethanol production at Green Plains’ three Nebraska facilities. A portion of these credits are being generated prior to the expected launch of carbon capture later this year, highlighting the competitive carbon intensity (CI) profile of the company’s current strategy and operations. Green Plains has also signed a term sheet with Freepoint to monetize tax credits from three additional facilities expected to qualify under 45Z during 2025.

""Executing this agreement and term sheet aligns with our long-term strategy to monetize the value we’re creating through low-CI production,"" said Chris Osowski, Chief Executive Officer. ""Our focus on operational excellence has improved utilization and yields across our platform, while also lowering carbon intensity – enabling several plants to qualify for 45Z credits during the current year. While we continue to advance carbon capture through the Trailblazer CCS project, this agreement demonstrates our ability to create near-term value from clean fuel production and expands our visibility into the monetization of carbon credits going forward.""

""This transaction marks a milestone in the rapidly evolving transferable tax credit market, enabling the transfer and monetization of 45Z Credits at an impactful scale. We're proud to collaborate with Green Plains on this innovative structure and establish the foundation for a multiyear relationship that delivers meaningful value to all stakeholders,"" said Connor Nix, Managing Director, Biofuels and Renewable Products at Freepoint.

The agreement covers the anticipated 2025 production year credits for the three Nebraska facilities, with full-year credits included where operations allow. The parties may agree on mutually satisfactory terms to extend the agreement to purchase 45Z credits for 2026-2029. The credits will be transferred through a direct transfer mechanism and are supported by third-party emissions verification and tax insurance.

Based on current expectations for production volumes and eligible gallons, the agreement and term sheet combined are expected to generate between $40 and $50 million in 2025 45Z EBITDA net of discounts and after applicable operating expenses, with the first credits being recorded in the third quarter. The final proceeds are dependent on actual production and the timing of startup for the carbon capture systems at Green Plains’ Nebraska facilities.

What Are Enhanced Premium Tax Credits?
Enhanced Premium Tax Credits were enacted during COVID-19 relief efforts and later extended.
What the New Bill Proposes The newly introduced House Republican bill would: Extend the enhanced tax credits for one year (through plan year 2026).","The Affordable Care Act’s (ACA) enhanced Premium Tax Credits have been a cornerstone of record marketplace enrollment. Extended in 2022 as part of the Inflation Reduction Act, they are set to expire at the end of 2025. However, a group of House Republicans are introducing new legislation

that would extend these subsidies for one additional year, through 2026.

This move highlights both the political sensitivity and the financial importance of these credits — but for employers, it also raises questions about what happens next and how to prepare for either outcome.

What Are Enhanced Premium Tax Credits?

Enhanced Premium Tax Credits were enacted during COVID-19 relief efforts and later extended. They:

Lowered average premium costs by $705 per year.

Expanded eligibility beyond 400% of the federal poverty level.

Fueled historic ACA Marketplace growth, particularly in states with high uninsured rates.

Without an extension, a projected 3.8 million people would lose coverage each year between 2026-2034 and premiums could rise 18 percent on average for 2026, according to analysis from the research firm KFF of insurance filings across the country.

What the New Bill Proposes

The newly introduced House Republican bill would:

Extend the enhanced tax credits for one year (through plan year 2026).

Delay but not eliminate the cliff of expiring subsidies.

Provide temporary relief for families facing steep premium increases.

While the bill signals recognition of the subsidies’ popularity, its passage remains uncertain due to cost concerns, partisan divisions, and competing legislative priorities.

Why It Matters for Employers

The prospect of PTCs going away after 2025 would increase healthcare costs but would remove a notable compliance hurdle for employers.

While expanded PTC eligibility benefits employees and their families, it also raises compliance risks for employers. PTCs serve as triggers for the IRS to identify potential ACA non-compliance.

When an employee receives a PTC from a state or federal health exchange, the IRS cross-references the request with the employer’s ACA filings to identify organizations that may not be compliant with the ACA’s Employer Mandate.

However, there are other downstream effects that could surface if PTCs are not extended.

When Marketplace subsidies shrink, more individuals may seek coverage through employer-sponsored plans. This could lead to:

Increased enrollment activity outside of open enrollment periods.

Increased enrollment costs as more employees turn to employer sponsored coverage

How to Prepare Now

Regardless of whether the one-year extension passes, maintaining ACA compliance is essential for large employers. Proactive steps include:

Conducting a Penalty Risk Assessment to identify potential exposure before filings.

Reviewing Safe Harbor Strategies to ensure contribution amounts meet the 2026 affordability threshold.

Maintaining Audit-Ready Records for ACA filings, including affordability calculations and coverage offers.

Leveraging Seamless Integrations with payroll and benefits systems to ensure accurate data reporting.

How Trusaic Can Help

Trusaic’s ACA Compliance Solution is built to help employers navigate shifting ACA requirements:

Real-Time Eligibility Tracking: Manage coverage obligations in dynamic workforces.

Safe Harbor Optimization: Calculate contributions with confidence under evolving affordability rules.

Penalty Risk Assessment: Spot compliance gaps before they lead to IRS fines.

Audit-Ready Reporting: Ensure filings stand up to scrutiny, even in an uncertain regulatory environment.

Final Thoughts

The proposed one-year extension of PTCs underscores the political and economic stakes of ACA policy. But whether subsidies are extended temporarily or eventually expire, employers must remain vigilant.

By adopting a proactive compliance strategy now, organizations can safeguard against volatility, mitigate IRS penalty risks, and remain compliant in the face of shifting ACA regulations.",https://trusaic.com/wp-content/uploads/Sept.-17-Premium-Tax-Credits-Extended.jpg,N,,2025-09-17 20:00:19.740839
,Congress,2025-09-17 20:37:12+00:00,the Guardian,Trump DoJ seeks to kill Vermont law that makes big oil pay for climate harm - The Guardian,"Dharna Noor, www.theguardian.com, dharna-noor",,,,,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/17/trump-vermont-oil-climate-superfund-act,"Donald Trump’s justice department has asked a judge to shut down a Vermont law which holds major polluters financially responsible for climate damages.
“This law is about holding big oil accountable for a portion of the damage it has already brought to Vermont’s farms, businesses, homeowners and communities,” said Paul Burns, executive director of the Vermont Public Interest Research Group, one of the organizations that helped to pass Vermont’s Climate Superfund law.
Kate Sinding Daly, senior vice-president for law and policy at the Conservation Law Foundation, said her organization would “continue to defend the state’s climate superfund law meant to protect the wallets of Vermont’s families and businesses.
In an April executive order, Trump instructed the justice department to “stop the enforcement” of climate superfund policies.
Legislators in at least a dozen states are looking to introduce or reintroduce climate superfund bills in 2026, he said.","Donald Trump’s justice department has asked a judge to shut down a Vermont law which holds major polluters financially responsible for climate damages.

In a brief filed on Monday in a federal court in Burlington, the administration said the policy was “unlawful on its face” and pushed the court to “end Vermont’s lawless experiment”.

“The Court should deny the motions to dismiss, grant the United States’ motion for summary judgment, declare the Superfund Act unconstitutional and unenforceable, and permanently enjoin Defendants from taking any actions to implement or enforce it,” Riley Walters, counsel to an acting assistant attorney general, wrote in the motion.

Passed in 2024, the Vermont policy – known as the Climate Superfund Act – requires major polluters to pay for their carbon emissions, which have warmed the planet and increased the intensity and frequency of extreme weather events, such as the floods which wreaked $1bn in damage on the state last year. New York passed a similar measure in December.

“This law is about holding big oil accountable for a portion of the damage it has already brought to Vermont’s farms, businesses, homeowners and communities,” said Paul Burns, executive director of the Vermont Public Interest Research Group, one of the organizations that helped to pass Vermont’s Climate Superfund law. “Vermont is well within its rights to protect its people in this way.”

The filing comes four months after the Department of Justice and Environmental Protection Agency sued Vermont and New York over the laws. In August, the state and two non-profits who were granted intervenor status, the Conservation Law Foundation and the Northeast Organic Farming Association of Vermont, asked the judge to dismiss the lawsuit.

Kate Sinding Daly, senior vice-president for law and policy at the Conservation Law Foundation, said her organization would “continue to defend the state’s climate superfund law meant to protect the wallets of Vermont’s families and businesses.

“Let’s be clear: this law is not a sweeping effort to regulate global greenhouse gas emissions, punish fossil fuel companies, or set federal policy on climate change,” she said. “This is Vermont using its legal right to raise revenue and protect the health, safety, and wellbeing of its residents from the ruinous, inescapable consequences of climate change.”

The motion is the latest attempt by the Trump administration to quash climate accountability efforts and environmental regulations. In an April executive order, Trump instructed the justice department to “stop the enforcement” of climate superfund policies.

In July, the administration proposed undoing the 2009 “endangerment finding”, which says planet-warming emissions endanger public health and should therefore be regulated under the Clean Air Act – the most audacious of more than 150 environmental rollbacks launched since Trump retook office in January.

Jamie Henn, director of the anti-fossil fuel non-profit Fossil Free Media, which backs the superfund laws, said Trump’s assault would not deter efforts to bring about financial accountability for global warming. Legislators in at least a dozen states are looking to introduce or reintroduce climate superfund bills in 2026, he said.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fba9b08642a0a838556897ad56689df9981880d6/443_0_4410_3530/master/4410.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=51edb59cbf06373ad3406edf2cad5242",N,,2025-09-17 18:06:14.880366

The report, “2025 North America virtual power plant market report,” finds that the VPP market broadened more than it deepened, with the number of company deployments, unique offtakers and market and utility programs monetized each growing more than 33%, while total capacity grew a more modest 13.7%.

“Utility program caps, capacity accreditation reforms and market barriers have prevented capacity from growing as fast as market activity,” said Ben Hertz-Shargel, global head of grid edge for Wood Mackenzie.

Market maturation continues

The share of VPP wholesale market capacity from residential customers increased to 10.2%, from 8.8% in 2024, still reflecting market barriers to small customers. Third-party data access for enrollment and market settlement are the primary blockers.

Penetration of battery storage and EV in VPP deployments continues, with 61% as many deployments including these technologies as those including smart thermostats, the incumbent technology.

Leading markets

California, Texas, New York and Massachusetts are the leading states, representing 37% of VPP deployments. Meanwhile, PJM and ERCOT, the regions with the greatest utility commitments to data center capacity, also have the greatest disclosed VPP offtake capacity.

“While data centers are the source of new load, there’s an enormous opportunity to tap VPPs as the new source of grid flexibility,” said Hertz-Shargel.

Offtake growth

The top 25 VPP offtakers procured over 100 MW each this year, while over half of all offtakers increased the number of deployments under them by at least 30% compared to last year, showing the breadth of the market. An “independent distributed power producer” business model has emerged, whose thesis is that energy arbitrage and grid service revenue can finance an electricity retailer’s third-party-owned storage offering.

Regulatory pushback

A majority of VPP aggregators and software providers do not support utilities rate basing DERs, a key plank of the Distributed Capacity Procurement model for utilities.

“This model is seen as limiting access of private capital and aggregators from the DER market, rather than leveraging customer and third-party-owned resources,” said Hertz-Shargel. “Meanwhile, there is broad consensus among experienced wholesale market participants that FERC Order 2222 was a missed opportunity and will not have a significant impact on market access.”

That’s one of the takeaways from EY’s latest Mobility Lens Forecaster, which predicts a slower trajectory on mass EV adoption in the US because of federal policy changes, affordability issues, and gaps in charging infrastructure.
The report underscores the risks of the US EV sector falling behind competitors in China and Europe.
“The EV transition is advancing—but unevenly,” Constantin Gall, EY global aerospace, defense, and mobility leader, said in a statement.
“We see all major sections of the world, whether it’s the US, Europe, or China, getting there, roughly, by 2050.","If the path to EV adoption were a highway, China would be zooming along in the fast lane, Europe would be trucking along at a respectable pace—and the US would be getting passed.

That’s one of the takeaways from EY’s latest Mobility Lens Forecaster, which predicts a slower trajectory on mass EV adoption in the US because of federal policy changes, affordability issues, and gaps in charging infrastructure.

The report underscores the risks of the US EV sector falling behind competitors in China and Europe. It also emphasizes that, though the road to full electrification may be bumpy, the world will one day get there.

“Electrification is the future…I think there’s a lot of questions out there as to whether or not people will fully adapt,” George Lenyo, EY Americas automotive leader, told Tech Brew. “The Mobility Lens Forecast really says, ‘Yes, they will,’ it’s just going to take longer than maybe people would have anticipated.”

Here’s what EY predicts is in store for the US market:

The timeline for battery-electric vehicles reaching 50% of new-vehicle sales has shifted from 2034 to 2039.

Alternative scenarios show BEVs reaching 50% of the market as early as 2036 or as late as 2042.

A sales “surge” is expected this year as buyers get ahead of the expiration of EV tax credits under President Donald Trump’s so-called One Big Beautiful Bill, followed by a decrease in 2026–2027.

Hybrid vehicle sales could peak at 34% of new-vehicle sales in 2034.

And by 2050, the forecast calls for BEVs to make up more than 95% of the market.

In China, meanwhile, EY forecasts that BEVs will make up more than half of new light-vehicle sales by 2033, “driven by lower costs and supportive policies” such as new vehicle emission standards—underscoring that the country “is pulling ahead in the global shift to EVs.” BEV adoption is expected to slow in Europe through 2027, but then to exceed 50% market share by 2032.

“The EV transition is advancing—but unevenly,” Constantin Gall, EY global aerospace, defense, and mobility leader, said in a statement. “The US faces policy uncertainty, high costs, and infrastructure gaps.”

Speed bumps: Lenyo pointed to tariffs and other policy changes, including the sunsetting this month of the EV tax incentives, as factors that explain the expected slowdown in US EV sales growth. The report also suggests that, starting in 2026, the price gap between BEVs and internal combustion engine vehicles could widen.

“The risk for the US is, how far do we fall behind because of these constraints that have been put upon them recently to deal with. I think that the OEMs are very resilient,” Lenyo said.

“They have to keep one foot in today and constantly be looking at [the] future of full electrification,” he added, “and balancing that investment accordingly.”

For adoption rates in the US to catch up with Europe and China, Lenyo said that affordability and infrastructure will need to improve, as will consumer education. The US EV charging sector is making progress on building more public fast chargers with the amenities that consumers are looking for, but there’s more work to be done.

“The big takeaway: Electrification is the future,” Lenyo said. “We see all major sections of the world, whether it’s the US, Europe, or China, getting there, roughly, by 2050. But the pace of that, specifically in the US, has slowed.”","https://cdn.sanity.io/images/bl383u0v/production/1f862a4beb7dc8b49a20c1864db5c627c189415b-1500x1000.jpg?rect=0,106,1500,788&w=1200&h=630&q=70&fit=crop&auto=format",N,,2025-09-17 17:00:37.956350

According to Dovere, one of the “best applications of distributed generation” is helping utilities avoid pricey infrastructure updates, by incentivizing consumers to invest in distributed generation resources like rooftop solar that increase resiliency when the grid is experiencing outages.
“And they get into a lot of trouble when they don’t, so they’re supposed to appropriately invest in a resilient infrastructure.” And in a crisis situation like the one that nearly occurred in 2022, distributed generation could be a literal lifesaver.","Hackers nearly taking over US energy plants. Federal cybersecurity groups thwarting the attacks. These alarming events aren’t plot points in a geopolitical thriller—this actually happened in 2022 when operators connected to Russia hacked into the US energy supply. Such an attack would have left everyday Americans without power and potentially no way to get it.

That is, unless they had distributed generation systems on or near their homes and businesses. Distributed generation is power at or near the location where it’s being consumed, like residential solar or heat pumps. It can also be solar panels on the roofs of commercial buildings that help power their business operations.

At a time when the US grid is under a lot of strain from excess demand and fluctuating supply, distributed generation stands to be an impactful solution, according to Richard Dovere, CEO of Dispatch Energy, which designs behind-the-meter renewable energy systems.

According to Dovere, one of the “best applications of distributed generation” is helping utilities avoid pricey infrastructure updates, by incentivizing consumers to invest in distributed generation resources like rooftop solar that increase resiliency when the grid is experiencing outages.

“Utilities are regulated monopolies, but they have an obligation to serve their customers reliably,” Dovere told Tech Brew. “And they get into a lot of trouble when they don’t, so they’re supposed to appropriately invest in a resilient infrastructure.”

And in a crisis situation like the one that nearly occurred in 2022, distributed generation could be a literal lifesaver.

“Our grid stability is a major vulnerability,” Dovere said. “If your power goes out and your grandmother’s on an oxygen machine, I don’t think you care about the [internal rate of return] of the [power] system.”

Dovere added that the Trump administration is using renewable energy resources as a “punching bag” by phasing out tax credits for solar energy. The administration has favored geothermal and nuclear energy, and many Republicans in Congress have pushed for an “all-of-the-above” energy strategy.

Dovere told Tech Brew that regardless of price, distributed solar is the best way “to service the largest amount of people to provide them at least some modicum of power.”

“Getting rid of solar renewable tax credits makes it more expensive,” Dovere said, but “people need the power.”","https://cdn.sanity.io/images/bl383u0v/production/c105982c55dbe7c202c9920759330fff2da851d6-5464x3640.jpg?rect=0,385,5464,2869&w=1200&h=630&q=70&fit=crop&auto=format",N,,2025-09-17 17:00:55.316540

He expects it’s going to be much harder to convince property owners to invest in solar once the federal tax incentive goes away.
This isn’t the first time Vermont’s solar industry has faced headwinds in recent years, yet it has still managed to prosper.
When the residential solar tax credit goes away, McCarthy expects it will hit Vermont harder than places such as New York, where state support for solar is stronger.
Renewable Energy Vermont, a trade group, is likely to push for state regulatory changes to better support the industry.","After the election of President Donald Trump last November, Chandler Evans began to worry that federal policies supporting renewable energy might be in jeopardy. The home Evans and his wife purchased in North Pomfret in 2022 already had a solar array on the barn, but he knew they’d need more juice for the heat pumps they hoped to add.

So, Evans got in touch with Catamount Solar, one of Vermont’s largest installers, and started strategizing how to add panels to his home before the tax credits for such systems dried up.

He’s glad he did. The federal spending bill that Trump signed into law on July 4 eliminates the long-standing 30 percent federal income tax credit for residential solar systems at the end of 2025. In Vermont, the change could jeopardize hundreds of good-paying jobs in the solar industry and slow down efforts to reduce fossil fuel emissions.

“I’m sad the incentives are going away,” Evans said. “It seems like a step backward instead of a step forward.”

The cuts threaten a sector that has grown into a pillar of the state’s economy. Despite Vermont’s long, dark winters, about 16 percent of the electricity generated in the state comes from solar. Overall, more than 18,000 people in Vermont — 6 percent of the workforce — hold clean energy jobs, according to a 2024 report from the Department of Public Service. About 1,800 of those workers sell or install solar systems, with most others engaged in energy-efficiency work such as insulating homes and installing heat pumps.

For the moment, the solar business is booming, thanks to people such as Evans who are racing to take advantage of the tax credits while they last. The incentive is a significant one: Homeowners who install a typical $35,000 array can deduct $10,500 from their federal income tax bill. So many people want to install solar that crews can’t keep up. Catamount, which placed 20 new panels atop Evans’ home earlier this month, is booked solid through the end of the year, general manager Jarred Cobb said.

SunCommon, the state’s largest residential solar installer, will likely reach that point later this month, president Mike McCarthy said last week.

“Our phones are ringing off the hook right now,” he said.

The Waterbury-based company is scrambling to get systems designed, permitted, financed and installed before the deadline. It’s a heady time, but it’s one that McCarthy knows will be short-lived. He expects it’s going to be much harder to convince property owners to invest in solar once the federal tax incentive goes away.

“It’s really unfortunate,” McCarthy said. “What [the federal budget bill] did to the residential solar tax credit is an assault on this industry.”

“I am very much feeling like we are battening down the hatches and shoring ourselves up for a storm,” he added.

SunCommon could look very different in the future as the solar landscape adapts to the federal changes, McCarthy said. (The Vermont company was purchased last year by the Houston-based investment firm Siltstone Capital after its own parent, iSun, went bankrupt.) It’s possible, for example, that SunCommon could focus on commercial installations, which still qualify for tax incentives but will face stricter rules and tighter timelines.

Nearly half of SunCommon’s revenue already comes from commercial customers. The firm recently scored the contract to install a $500,000 array atop the new Burlington High School, McCarthy noted, and has been shifting some commercial work to next year so it can focus on time-sensitive residential jobs.

The company is also considering a new business model in which it would lease solar arrays to homeowners rather than selling them. Since the homeowner doesn’t own the system, the arrangement is considered a commercial installation and may still generate tax credits.

Navigating these and other shifts — including ever-changing tariffs and complex new requirements on where solar components are made — has been nerve-racking, McCarthy said.

“No business wants to operate in an environment of uncertainty about what your entire industry is going to look like in six months to a year,” he said.

And there’s more: Vermont had been anticipating $62.5 million in grants from a $7 billion federal program called Solar for All. Established under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, the program was designed to help low-income Vermonters afford solar.

U.S. Environmental Protection Agency administrator Lee Zeldin killed the program in August, claiming it was “grift” and a “boondoggle.” U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), a strong supporter of Solar for All, called its elimination illegal and vowed to fight the move. The state Department of Public Service, which had already set up a program to distribute the money in Vermont, also pledged to get the funding restored, including through litigation if needed.

Attorney General Charity Clark, no stranger to suing the Trump administration, said her team is “building the best path forward” to recoup the funds by analyzing a recent U.S. Supreme Court decision affecting how states can fight grant cancellations.

“What the Trump Administration is doing is unconstitutional, and I want to reassure Vermonters that I will continue to fight,” she said in a statement.

This isn’t the first time Vermont’s solar industry has faced headwinds in recent years, yet it has still managed to prosper. Utility regulators have been steadily reducing the amount that homeowners are reimbursed for the solar power they sell to the grid. Permitting costs are high, and there can be intense local opposition to large projects, especially if they are highly visible or covering farmland.

For these and other reasons, SunCommon and larger companies have opened offices in states where installation costs are lower. When the residential solar tax credit goes away, McCarthy expects it will hit Vermont harder than places such as New York, where state support for solar is stronger.

Renewable Energy Vermont, a trade group, is likely to push for state regulatory changes to better support the industry.

“Writ large, the impact on Vermont and New England of the actions of the Trump administration and the Congress will be significant,” said Peter Sterling, the group’s executive director. “It increases our reliance on natural gas, which is very expensive.” How changing federal policies will affect the transition to 100 percent renewable energy is a focus of the group’s annual conference in South Burlington on October 15.

The state could help the industry in several ways, Sterling said. Permitting reforms could speed up approval of larger solar projects; regulators or lawmakers could increase what solar system owners are paid for the power they feed into the grid.

The Public Utility Commission will reset that rate next year, but it’s too soon to say whether the Department of Public Service will advocate for an increase, said TJ Poor, its director of efficiency and energy resources.

Some in the industry acknowledge the challenges ahead but say solar’s future remains bright. Vermonters are so unhappy that the country is shifting back toward fossil fuels under Trump that they may continue to embrace solar in spite of his effort to kill it, said Cobb, the manager at Catamount.

“I hope,” he said, “that there’s an ethos in Vermont of: Fuck whatever’s happening in Washington — we’re going to keep doing things the way we’re doing things.”

Solar installations will still make economic as well as environmental sense in the future as photovoltaic technology improves and component costs continue to decline, according to Megan Beattie, director of sales and marketing for South Burlington-based Green Mountain Solar. And as electric bills rise, home solar offers people a way to lock in electricity costs now, sidestepping future rate increases, she noted.

“The value proposition for solar is definitively still there,” Beattie said. “Obviously the tax credit ending is abrupt and it creates a bit of a shift, but we don’t see it killing the solar industry by any means.”

With central generation challenged by supply chains, permitting, interconnection queues and - particularly for natural gas generation - construction costs, utilities have increasingly been looking to distributed resources to fill the gap. These resources are aggregated into virtual power plants (VPPs) which are monetized through utility, energy retailer, and wholesale market programs.

In our 2025 North America virtual power plant market report, we break down the growth of the virtual power plant (VPP) market according to metrics that capture its scale and its maturity. Fill out the form to download an extract from the report and read on for highlights from some key findings.

A market that is broadening faster than it is deepening

There was enormous market activity over the last year. Company deployments, unique offtakers, and programs monetized each grew over 33% year-over-year. This reflects pull from new flexibility buyers as well as push from new VPP players, many who are filling new roles in the value chain.

At the same time, overall VPP capacity grew 13.7%. This more modest growth indicates a market that is broadening faster than it is deepening. Enrollment caps on utility programs, capacity accreditation reforms in power markets (the migration to effective load carrying capability), and market barriers to small customers have limited capacity growth in existing programs.

VPP offtakes are largest where utility data center commitments are largest

A particularly interesting finding is that while California, Texas, New York, and Massachusetts are the leading states, representing 37% of all VPP deployments, PJM and ERCOT, the regions with the greatest utility commitments to data center capacity, also have the greatest disclosed VPP offtake capacity. This drives home the opportunity for utilities and even hyperscalers themselves to procure new VPP capacity to offset data center coincident peak demand, enabling faster grid connection. In this way homeowners and business owners might actually earn revenue from the connection of new data centers, offsetting potential bill increases.

A fault line over utility ownership over DER

A related finding regards utility ownership of DER, a foundational element of the Distributed Capacity Procurement model. A survey of key players revealed that while hardwire providers are understandably enthusiastic about utilities as a new sales channel, the majority of other VPP companies do not support utilities rate basing DER. This approach could limit private capital and aggregator access to the DER market, unlike the third-party VPP procurement model above. There is far more enthusiasm for utilities integrating DER into system planning and operations, specifying where such resources are needed, but letting the market supply them, via customer programs and competitive solicitations. In this way the market can find the lowest-cost solution and drive innovation across the whole value chain, from program marketing to cross-technology optimization.

The facility integrates advanced automation, R&D capabilities, and sustainable design features to support international supply chains, Elcogen said, adding that it is powered by a 9 MW energy supply from the nearby Iru Power Plant and incorporates sustainability measures such as process heat reuse and thermal oxidisers to reduce emissions.

With approximately €50 million in capital investment, the facility was reportedly delivered on time and on budget by construction partner Maru Ehitus AS and equipment suppliers. Funding for the project was provided by Elcogen stakeholders, including U.S.-based energy technology company Baker Hughes and South Korea’s conglomerate HD Hyundai. As informed, the project also received support from the European Innovation Fund, which has committed an additional €25 million to expand capacity under Elcogen’s ELCO I initiative.

Enn Õunpuu, CEO of Elcogen, stated: “This new facility is built for scale, speed, and global impact. As demand for reliable Solid Oxide-based clean energy solutions accelerates worldwide, Elcogen is now uniquely positioned to deliver the high-performance technology the market needs, at commercial volumes.”

“As the name implies, ELCO I serves as a flagship model designed to guide future development initiatives globally. It reflects our broader vision for international expansion and leadership in clean energy solutions. We plan to eventually license our technology and manufacturing blueprint to trusted partners. This ensures consistent IP control while enabling local manufacturing – a particularly attractive proposition for markets focused on domestic production and resilient supply chains.”

Chris Nash, Chair of Elcogen’s Board of Directors, remarked: “This new facility sends a strong message that Elcogen is ready for large scale delivery. We are committed to partnering with global system integrators, strategic partners and governments to build resilient, low-carbon energy systems of the future.”

Founded in 2001, Elcogen supplies fuel cell and electrolyzer components to various clean energy projects. The company’s components – cells, stacks, and modules – are reportedly integrated into third-party systems for a wide range of applications, including distributed energy, off-grid and stationary power, industrial backup, green hydrogen production, and Power-to-X solutions.

Elcogen’s workforce is said to include nearly 150 employees from over 20 nationalities. The new facility is expected to eventually support the creation of circa 300 local jobs as the company transitions to mass production and increases global delivery capabilities.

Õunpuu noted: “Yes, we are expanding capacity, but this is also about increasing the performance of our products and reducing costs for our partners across the energy value chain. This is a facility designed to deliver on the promise of clean energy, now.”

Commenting on the opening of the facility, Jorgo Chatzimarkakis, CEO of Hydrogen Europe, said: “With Elcogen’s new facility, Europe gains a powerful boost in electrolysis and fuel cell capacity – technologies that are inseparable from the hydrogen economy. The roots of excellence now bear fruit on an industrial scale. This makes us proud as Europeans: hydrogen is the people’s molecule, and Estonia shows how to turn vision into reality.”

In other 2025 news, Elcogen secured a €5 million investment from SmartCap, a venture capital fund supporting Estonian greentech companies. Furthermore, the manufacturer entered into a non-exclusive memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Swiss industrial equipment supplier Casale to collaborate on green ammonia and other Power-to-X projects.

Looking Ahead The OBBBA fundamentally reshapes clean energy incentives by accelerating phaseouts, shortening deadlines, and layering in complex new foreign entity restrictions.
Credits phase out sooner for wind, solar, and certain manufacturing components, so consider accelerated construction and financing schedules.","I. Background

On July 4, 2025, President Trump signed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) into law, marking a significant turn in US clean energy policy. The new law dismantles or narrows many of the clean energy tax credits introduced under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA). For developers, manufacturers, and investors, the message is clear: access to federal tax credits is shrinking, and the rules for eligibility are tightening.

Days after signing the OBBBA, on July 7, President Trump reinforced this policy shift with an executive order (EO 14315) directing federal agencies to end support for wind, solar, and other “green” technologies. Treasury was tasked with enforcing accelerated deadlines and stricter rules to prevent projects from using safe harbors to lock in credits for wind and solar. Together, the OBBBA and EO 14315 set the stage for a new framework that scales back incentives and imposes tougher compliance hurdles, particularly around foreign ownership and supply chain sourcing.

II. New IRS Guidance: “Beginning of Construction” Rules

The IRS acted quickly, following EO 14315 with Notice 2025-42, which provides new rules addressing when wind and solar projects are considered to have “begun construction” for purposes of qualifying for the production tax credit (PTC) and investment tax credit (ITC) under Sections 45Y and 48E, respectively.[1] This notice significantly narrows the pathways available to developers.

The familiar “5% safe harbor” introduced under Notice 2013-29 and further clarified under various IRS notices, such as Notice 2018-59 and Notice 2022-61 (Prior Notices), is eliminated for most wind and solar projects. Instead, taxpayers must now satisfy the “physical work test,” which requires that physical work of a significant nature begins before July 5, 2026. That said, the 5% safe harbor is preserved for small-scale solar projects (1.5 MW or less), recognizing the unique challenges for distributed generation.

Qualifying work under the physical work test can include on-site activities such as excavation for wind turbine foundations or installation of racking for solar panels, as well as certain off-site manufacturing activities performed pursuant to binding written contracts. Preliminary steps like permitting or site clearing are not counted toward the physical work test.

Once construction begins, projects must maintain a continuous program of construction (i.e., the “continuity requirement”). That said, the “continuity safe harbor” from the Prior Notices still exists. If a project is placed in service within four years of the end of the year in which construction began, the project is treated as having satisfied the continuity requirement. If the construction period extends beyond the four-year safe harbor, a solar developer can no longer rely on merely showing “continuous efforts” but must be able to demonstrate a continuous program of construction that involves continuing physical work of a significant nature.

Fortunately, Notice 2025-42 preserves a list of excusable disruptions, such as weather, interconnection delays, and permitting delays, for purposes of satisfying the continuity requirement.

Finally, it is worth noting that Notice 2025-42 specially provides that the “beginning of construction” rules set forth in the notice are not intended to address the “beginning of construction” rules for purposes of determining whether a project is subject to the new restrictions on foreign involvement discussed below. Such guidance is currently being prepared by Treasury.

For developers, the takeaway is clear: simply incurring costs or securing contracts will no longer be sufficient. Projects must demonstrate physical progress of a significant nature on or before the July 4, 2026 deadline to remain eligible for PTCs or ITCs without being subject to the accelerated December 31, 2027 placed-in-service deadline.

III. Change Under the OBBBA

New Restrictions on Foreign Involvement

A central feature of the OBBBA is the creation of the Prohibited Foreign Entity (PFE) regime. The goal is to limit foreign influence in the US clean energy sector, especially from countries deemed adversarial to the United States, such as China, Russia, North Korea, and Iran.

The rules operate on two levels:

Specified Foreign Entities (SFEs): entities directly tied to adversarial governments or named in laws like the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act.

Foreign-Influenced Entities (FIEs): entities where an SFE has significant influence, such as owning at least 25%, holding certain debt interests, or having contractual control.

Even if a developer isn’t itself an SFE or FIE, projects can still lose eligibility if (1) they begin construction after December 31, 2025, and (2) they rely too heavily on goods or services sourced from PFEs. Treasury will measure this through a “material assistance” test, which compares overall project costs with the portion tied to PFEs. The thresholds will tighten overtime — wind and solar projects must show 40% non-PFE content in 2026, rising to 60% by 2030. Similar rules will apply across technologies, from batteries to inverters to critical minerals.

While official safe harbor tables won’t arrive until late 2026, transitional relief allows developers to rely on IRS Notice 2025-08 and supplier certifications in the meantime. Developers will need to closely track supply chains now, as eligibility will become progressively harder to maintain. As noted above, the “beginning of construction” rules under Notice 2025-42 for purposes of determining whether a project is eligible for PTCs or ITCs are not intended to address the “beginning of construction” rules for purposes of determining whether a project is subject to the “material assistance” restrictions. Until Treasury issues specific guidance, the historic “beginning of construction” rules remain applicable for this purpose.

Key Changes by Credit

Investment Tax Credit (Section 48E): Wind and solar face early termination deadlines — in order to be eligible for this credit, construction must begin on or before July 4, 2026, or, for projects beginning construction after July 4, 2026, such projects must be placed in service by the end of 2027. As discussed earlier, Notice 2025-42 introduced new rules on when wind and solar projects are considered to have begun construction, which further narrows eligibility. That said, other technologies like geothermal, nuclear, and hydrogen retain longer timelines, with a gradual phaseout starting in 2034.

Production Tax Credits (Section 45Y): Similarly, wind and solar projects must meet the July 4, 2026 “beginning of construction” date or the December 31, 2027 placed-in-service deadline. Other technologies, such as geothermal, hydrogen, and nuclear projects, are subject to the same phaseout schedule as the Section 48E ITCs.

Advanced Manufacturing Production Credits (Section 45X): Wind components produced and sold after December 31, 2027 are ineligible for the Section 45X credit. With respect to critical minerals, the OBBBA (1) included metallurgical coal as an applicable critical mineral, and (2) provided for a critical mineral phaseout beginning in 2031 (except for metallurgical coal, which phases out beginning in 2030). In addition, the OBBBA tightened the definition of “battery modules” eligible for the Section 45X credit by clarifying that a battery module is comprised of all other essential equipment needed for battery functionality. The PFE rules also apply here, forcing manufacturers to reevaluate sourcing strategies.

Carbon Oxide Sequestration Credit (Section 45Q): Credit amounts are equalized at $17 per ton (base) for carbon captured from industrial and power facilities (increased to $85 per ton if the prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements are satisfied) and $36 per ton (base) for direct air capture (increased to $180 per ton if the prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements are satisfied), regardless of end use. But PFE restrictions will now limit who can claim or transfer the Section 45Q credits.

Zero-Emission Nuclear Power Production Credit (Section 45U): The Section 45U credit for electricity production at existing nuclear power plants that were operational at the time of enactment of the IRA (i.e., placed in service prior to August 16, 2022) remains intact through 2032, but with new restrictions on sourcing nuclear fuel from covered nations. Specifically, after December 31, 2027, taxpayers must certify that any nuclear fuel was not sourced from covered nations or “covered entities” (unless pursuant to a binding contract in force prior to January 1, 2023). In addition, SFEs are not eligible to claim the Section 45U credit after the date of enactment of the OBBBA, and FIEs cannot claim the Section 45U credit for tax year beginning after the second anniversary of the date of enactment.

Clean Hydrogen Production Credit (Section 45V): Eligibility for the per kilogram credit for qualified clean hydrogen production now requires construction to begin before 2028, significantly shortening the runway for new projects. Projects beginning construction after December 31, 2027, will no longer be eligible.

Clean Production Fuel Credit (Section 45Z): The Section 45Z credit for the production of certain transportation fuel and sustainable aviation fuel has been extended and is available through 2029, but with narrowed eligibility and stricter sourcing rules. PFE restrictions also apply. For example, for fuel produced after December 31, 2025, the enhanced rate for sustainable aviation fuel is no longer available and the credit value for fuels derived from foreign feedstocks would be reduced by 20%.

Direct Pay and Transferability (Sections 6417 and 6418): Both remain available, but credits cannot be transferred to PFEs (immediately for SFEs and two years later for FIEs).

IV. Looking Ahead

The OBBBA fundamentally reshapes clean energy incentives by accelerating phaseouts, shortening deadlines, and layering in complex new foreign entity restrictions. While certain technologies like nuclear and hydrogen retain more favorable treatment, the overarching trend is a sharp contraction in federal support for wind, solar, and PFE-linked projects.

Below is a list of action items for developers to do now:

Move quickly on project starts. Wind and solar developers must begin construction on or before July 4, 2026 to preserve credit eligibility while retaining the four-year “continuity safe harbor” to place the project in service; otherwise, such projects that begin construction after the first anniversary of the enactment of the OBBBA have to be placed in service by the end of 2027.

Focus on the Physical Work Test. For wind and solar projects, developers can no longer “begin construction” by satisfying a 5% safe harbor (other than certain small-scale solar projects of 1.5 MW or less). Paying or incurring costs for the manufacturing of project components is no longer enough — developers must plan for tangible, qualifying construction steps that constitute physical work of a significant nature, both for purposes of showing that construction began and for purposes of maintaining a continuous program of construction.

Track supply chains. The introduction of the PFE regime intended to limit foreign influence in the US clean energy sector means that developers and manufacturers must strengthen the supplier due diligence process and carefully document sourcing of key inputs to ensure no impermissible material assistance and build strategies to reduce foreign exposure.

Plan for shorter timelines. Credits phase out sooner for wind, solar, and certain manufacturing components, so consider accelerated construction and financing schedules.

Monitor Treasury guidance. Future notices (including notices regarding the PFE regime and the beginning of construction rules for the PFE regime) will shape enforcement and safe harbor rules; staying up to date will be critical to avoid disqualification.

In this new era, careful planning and compliance will be essential to securing clean energy tax incentives, and maintaining strong documentation will be key to supporting credit eligibility and ensuring investors and tax credit purchasers that the underlying credits are secure.

In July, congressional Republicans gutted the landmark clean energy investments in the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) to help pay for the President’s tax breaks for the wealthy. Meanwhile, the Administration continues to test legal boundaries in its attempts to freeze clean energy funding, roll back greenhouse gas regulations, and “stop the enforcement” of states’ climate laws.

A less reported casualty of this onslaught is the resulting dysphoria for the U.S. climate movement. The network of organizers and wonks that recently birthed the largest climate investment in U.S. history now finds itself without a clear offensive strategy.

Many climate advocates are rightly focused on defense—working indefatigably to extinguish the flames that Trump’s Cabinet has ignited in our climate policy edifice. But we also need architects to start sketching what we’ll build in the ashes. It was during the first Trump Administration that we crafted the vision and policy framework that led to the IRA. And it is now that we must start laying the foundation for the next federal governing moment.

The blueprints for what comes next may seem hazy. But one thing is clear: We need to build a climate agenda written not about impacted workers and communities, but by them.

Everything Bagels Make Tasty Policy

A starting point for crafting the next wave of climate policies is to take stock of our successes and missteps in building the last one. What lessons can we glean from our collective work during the first Trump Administration to create the policy, organizing, and narrative architecture that helped pave the way for President Biden’s signature climate law?

From 2018 to 2020, a motley mix of policymakers, unions, climate organizations, and racial, economic, and environmental justice groups forged the strategy that would come to define the IRA: uniting climate, jobs, and justice goals. The underlying theory was clear and compelling. Tackling the climate crisis would require trillions of dollars in clean energy investments, which, properly guided, could flow into good union jobs and communities that have endured decades of disinvestment.

Though Congress whittled down the bold initial proposals from the Build Back Better agenda, many of the surviving policies in the final IRA legislation upheld the climate-jobs-justice trifecta. To convert clean energy growth into good jobs, the law’s climate investments included strong incentives for clean energy companies to partner with unions, pay decent wages, provide equitable training pathways, and sign agreements with community coalitions for locally defined benefits. To ensure that such benefits helped redress longstanding inequities, the IRA incentivized clean energy investments in low-income neighborhoods, communities fighting for environmental justice, coal-producing areas, and other communities sidelined by years of trickle-down economics.

Three premises formed the foundation for this strategy. Only two of them have held up. The third, as-yet-unfulfilled premise points the way forward.

Premise number one was that we can indeed deliver on climate, jobs, and justice objectives at the same time. This “everything bagel” strategy took flack for trying to do too much. Some suggested we might need to sacrifice labor and equity provisions to achieve meaningful clean energy expansion.

But everything bagels taste good for a reason: They combine ingredients that go well together. For policies, as for bagels, the goal is to use congruent ingredients.

Recent data indicate that clean energy growth, union jobs, and equitable investments can pair just as well as garlic, onion, and poppy seeds. Despite congressional Republicans’ recent rollback of many IRA investments, the law’s first few years yielded significant progress on all three fronts: a record 49-gigawatt boom in clean energy installations last year, a historic high in clean energy union density, and a notable 75 percent of clean investments going to communities where the median income is below the national median. This win-win-win is not an accidental outcome. It is the intentional result of a deliberate everything bagel strategy.

Premise number two was that this combination of ingredients was also smart politics—that it would unite unions, climate advocates, clean energy companies, and other constituencies to build the advocacy muscle needed to pass legislation over the opposition of well-heeled interests. This theory held water in the push to pass the IRA. It is unlikely the bill would have survived the congressional gauntlet without strong backing from such a broad spectrum of influential stakeholders. And this cross-sector push would not have materialized if the bill had singularly focused on gigawatts of clean energy while sidelining opportunities for workers and communities to reap the economic, health, and environmental rewards of the clean-energy transition.

No one likes a plain bagel. And legislatures don’t tend to prioritize things people don’t like.

This Doesn’t Feel Like Winning

What has not fared well is premise number three of the IRA strategy—that by linking climate investments with economic benefits, we would spur a broad, popular clamor to defend those investments and expand on them in future legislation. We would create a virtuous cycle, the theory went, in which the economic benefits of each round of climate investments would garner votes for the next.

It’s safe to say that has not happened. Congressional Republicans’ plan to dismantle the IRA did not spark sufficient outcry from voters to protect the bulk of the law’s clean energy investments. And a demand for more climate investments is hardly on the tips of working folks’ tongues from southeast Michigan to suburban Atlanta. Why not? What was the flaw in the logic? As it turns out, there were several.

First, messaging and policy gaps have hobbled us. Many observers have noted that repeatedly citing remarkable jobs statistics to promote the IRA came off as tone-deaf amid low unemployment and the very real economic anxiety caused by high inflation. Our climate messages have been heavy on creating jobs but light on cutting costs. That messaging gap stems from a policy gap. While the initial Build Back Better agenda included climate policies that took aim at families’ biggest costs, such as robust investments in affordable, energy-efficient housing and public transit, Congress cut those investments in the sausage-making that produced the IRA. Much work remains, both in policy and narrative, to develop an affordability-focused climate agenda that offers serious answers to help reduce the cost of living.

A less discussed messaging problem is the missed opportunity to cultivate a much broader base of local, trusted messengers as spokespeople for the federal investments flowing into their communities. When it came time for a ribbon cutting at a new, IRA-funded facility, could we have done more to equip the local reverend or imam, Main Street business owner, or city council member to go in front of the cameras and speak on the importance of long-sought investments in their community? Few national figures can match the authenticity or authority of such local leaders.

Much work remains to develop a climate agenda that offers serious answers to help reduce the cost of living.

Beyond messaging, the lackluster demand for protecting or enacting climate investments also owes to a more vexing challenge: the long lag time between passing a law, deploying investments, building something, and seeing the economic benefits materialize. That lag, for example, is likely to be at least six years for some of the clean manufacturing investments in the IRA. Tragically, a six-year wait is two years longer than a presidential administration. If we can’t deliver results within the span of an electoral cycle, the political economy of our everything bagel strategy has a sizable hole in it (pun definitely intended).

Proponents of the ascendant “abundance” worldview have rightly spotlighted this stumbling block. There is no question that we need to reduce the time it takes to build clean energy projects. The emissions math and political calculus both demand it. But to build faster, we need to name the sources of delay precisely. Imprecision risks remedies that are not only ineffective, but harmful. Elon Musk, for example, attempted to co-opt the “abundance” narrative to justify DOGE’s slash-and-burn deregulation. To expedite clean energy growth without needlessly sacrificing key protections, let’s look at the data on what actually causes delays.

In the name of clean energy “abundance,” some suggest we should jettison incentives for clean energy companies to create good jobs or invest in hard-hit communities, such as those included in the IRA “everything bagel.” But this prescription misdiagnoses the problem. The lag in building clean energy projects doesn’t stem from pro-worker or pro-equity incentives. In a 2023 survey of clean energy developers, such policies did not make the cut for the six biggest sources of project delays. And the inclusion of labor and equity incentives didn’t deter clean energy companies from enthusiastically pursuing IRA funding opportunities, some of which received applications for more than ten times the available funding.

In fact, such policies can actually facilitate clean energy buildout. For example, wage standards and apprenticeship programs for construction workers provide cost-effective ways for clean energy companies to overcome the widely reported difficulty of recruiting a skilled and stable workforce in a tight labor market. Community benefits agreements, meanwhile, offer developers a tool to garner explicit community support for clean energy projects in exchange for economic benefits, instead of risking local opposition—a leading cause of project delays. Incentives for clean energy companies to invest in low-income communities are also on the pro-building side of the ledger, as they help spur clean energy deployment in neighborhoods the market has deemed unprofitable.

Instead of sidelining labor and equity standards, an abundance agenda should target the real sources of delay in building clean energy. Key culprits include: backlogged queues for connecting clean energy to the electrical grid due to a lack of systemic planning, a growing list of local, NIMBY-esque siting restrictions for clean energy projects in both red and blue states, too-little-too-late forms of community engagement that risk community opposition to new projects, and supply chain shortages that mean waiting more than two and a half years to obtain a power transformer.

A clear focus on real snags like these—many of which require more policy, not less—can help to speed up clean energy projects while maintaining the economic benefits for working families that help expand support for further buildout.

Climate Policy: A Project of the Professional Class?

But there’s another fundamental reason for the tepid demand to advance the clean energy agenda: the lack of broad involvement in designing that agenda. People are unlikely to call for more climate investments if they do not see themselves in those investments. And they are unlikely to see themselves in investments they did not help to build. But to date, building climate policy has largely been a project of the professional class.

The path to success is not for D.C. professionals (myself included) to bust out of our offices in a few years and proclaim, “We’ve written an IRA 2.0. And trust us, working America, it’ll be great for your families and communities.” That approach would likely fall flat.

The workers and communities who most stand to benefit from a new wave of climate investments need to be at the forefront of crafting those investments. That is essential both for getting the policies right and for building the power to get them passed.

For too long, building power and building policy have been treated as two separate crafts. (This bifurcation is not unique to the climate movement.) Policy is often entrusted to the wonk class, while the grassroots is asked to provide reliable votes and calls to Congress. That is, the vast majority of the country is typically treated as public policy’s passive recipient, not its agent. This approach has several pitfalls.

First, ignoring the on-the-ground expertise of millions is not particularly democratic. The notion that those impacted by a policy should have a say in its design is a fundamental tenet of democracy. Today’s rift between policy design and policy impact undercuts that principle.

Second, inside-baseball policymaking can also yield misguided policy. Many of us who spend our time in policy schools and the halls of power bring useful technical know-how but lack in-depth experience with how policies play out on the ground. That means we’re missing vital information for aligning policy impact with intent—information that local organizers can readily offer, if they are included in the policymaking process.

Third, a professionals-only approach also misses opportunities to build power, which risks anemic policy pushes. If the next big thing in climate action were to be crafted exclusively in the D.C. bubble, we would be left with the unenviable task of explaining to the rest of the country why they should vocally support a policy they didn’t ask for. Without strong backing in key states and congressional districts, elite policycraft would produce not a new law, but yet another white paper.

To build a successful next wave of climate policies, we need a blueprint by and for regular folks.

Building a Broadly Backed Climate Agenda

Thankfully, over the next couple of years, several blue states have a real shot at passing progressive policies that could feed a new federal policy agenda. These are openings to build policy and power at the same time by merging the technical expertise of wonks with the grounded expertise of workers and communities. Could we equip community groups and unions in those states to be involved in the first steps of crafting state climate legislation, rather than treating their support as a last-step checkbox?

To do so, we have existing bottom-up models to learn from. In Illinois, for example, a broad coalition of community, climate, environmental justice, and other groups came together in school gyms and church sanctuaries during the first Trump term to hash out shared priorities for a new state climate bill. They then worked with legislators and experts to translate those priorities into the technical prose of legislation, jointly crafting one of the nation’s most ambitious and equitable state-level climate policies: the Climate and Equitable Jobs Act. The broad-based involvement in designing the policy led to an equally big-tent advocacy push for the bill, which overwhelmed corporate-backed opposition and won passage of the law in 2021.

And yet, such broad participation in policy design tends to be the exception. To build a widely backed climate agenda, it needs to become the rule.

Several blue states have a real shot at passing progressive policies that could feed a new federal policy agenda.

Of course, this agenda can hardly be built in blue states alone. In red and purple states, the coming years may not produce many new climate policies, but they will yield new clean energy, transportation, and manufacturing projects. Despite congressional Republicans’ curtailing of IRA investments and the ensuing cancellation of some projects, other projects are going forward. Thanks to the steady decline in the price of batteries and wind and solar power, many clean energy projects will continue to make good business sense.

Unions and community groups are already taking advantage of this influx of investments to negotiate with clean energy companies for material wins. These efforts build on pre-IRA successes like an agreement that the nonprofits Greater Birmingham Ministries and Jobs to Move America negotiated to secure equitable hiring and training opportunities at an electric bus factory in Alabama. On the heels of that agreement, the industrial division of the Communications Workers of America ran a successful union organizing drive at the factory and secured a contract last year to give workers a sizable increase in wages. Now underrepresented workers can access training pathways to get good union jobs making electric buses in the heart of Alabama, a right-to-work state.

If local groups are resourced to multiply such victories and negotiate tangible gains from the clean investments entering their communities, the base of active support for clean energy may just expand outwards—even in the ruby red South. Even in the purple Midwest. Even in the shadow of the Trump Administration.

What Does Bottom-Up Policy Design Look Like?

But how exactly does participatory design of such policies or agreements work? Certainly, it can’t be as simple as inviting a bunch of unionists, community organizers, faith leaders, and environmentalists into a room and asking them to produce a bill or a legally binding agreement.

Indeed, it is not. But it also need not be a lengthy or cumbersome process. An extensive survey of existing participatory policy design initiatives in the United States and around the world found that the entire design process typically takes six to seven months—on par with the time often required to develop bills the conventional way.

A growing array of proven participatory models show that stakeholders can efficiently craft policy solutions if they have a foundation of trust, a precise agenda, and skillful facilitation. If a room full of union workers, clergy, student activists, and community organizers who have never worked together is simply asked, “What policies do you want?” the answer is likely to be either cacophony or awkward silence. But if organizers start by separately asking each constituency to identify potential solutions for a well-defined problem, a Venn diagram may emerge, revealing options at the center for co-designing mutually beneficial policy.

Take housing, for example. How could a range of groups in a given state find common cause on state-level housing policies that address immediate economic priorities while also cutting climate pollution?

To start, community organizers in one of the state’s largest cities might invite residents of a low-income neighborhood to a spaghetti dinner in a church auditorium to discuss possible solutions to soaring rent, utility bills, and homeowner’s insurance. Several towns away, a few dozen electricians, carpenters, and other members of construction unions are sitting in a union hall and rank-ordering the biggest problems they face in local building projects, from wage theft to safety hazards. An hour’s drive north, a mix of youth and retirees gather in the public library for the monthly meeting of a local environmental group. At a facilitator’s prompt, they write options on Post-it notes for how to reduce the 15 percent slice of U.S. climate pollution that comes from homes.

After hearing the takeaways from these housing-focused convenings, urban planning professors at a state university invite leaders from each of the groups to join a facilitated discussion and compare notes on what they heard. A common thread emerges: The buildout of new affordable housing could help tamp down rising rents, and with proper siting, it could boost proximity to public transit while decreasing proximity to air pollution hazards. With the right labor standards, it could help construction unions negotiate for better wages, benefits, and safety protections. And with the right design specifications, the new houses could come with energy-efficient heating and cooling systems, rooftop solar panels, and increased resilience to storm and flooding damage.

A labor leader in attendance sums up the prevailing view of the room, saying, “There’s potential for a win-win here, but the devil is in the details.” The facilitator suggests they reconvene to discuss those details by examining concrete options for state housing policies.

How the Bagel Gets Made

In the next convening, the stakeholder groups meet with housing experts from the university, who present a menu of potential new policies for the groups to size up. Options include state incentives for inclusionary zoning, retooled housing trust funds, use of public land to build green social housing, and so on. After the discussion reveals several areas of potential alignment, group leaders decide to formalize their partnership as a public-facing coalition.

The new coalition’s leaders then take a trip to the state capitol to meet with their state representatives, seeking out a few who might be interested in partnering to craft housing legislation. The leaders’ pitch to legislators is simple and compelling: We’re offering you an opportunity to lead a bill that is likely to have wide and vocal backing. After a few meetings, three legislators commit to working with the coalition to champion a bill that reflects their priorities.

Commitments in hand, the coalition groups send their organizers back to the church auditoriums, union halls, and public libraries to talk with their members. This time, they come with pointed questions and surveys to suss out their members’ preferences on key policy design questions: What would they see as a meaningful reduction in monthly energy costs? How would they balance new construction and retrofits of existing homes? And so on.

With a sharp understanding of their members’ specific priorities, the coalition leaders meet to hash out their various—at times, competing—policy design objectives. The state legislative champions send their staff to join the meetings alongside the state university’s housing policy experts, who pose questions to the coalition leaders to identify their preferences on design tradeoffs. Issues of contention are met with creative policy options, negotiation, and, in some cases, voting to reach group decisions. After a few spirited Zoom calls and late-night discussions, the deliberative process results in a draft legislative text.

The coalition leaders once again go back to their members and use slide decks and small group discussions to spotlight the contents of the draft bill and invite final feedback. After further massaging the language with the legislative champions to incorporate members’ suggestions, the coalition leaders vote to back the legislation.

With the final text in hand, the legislative champions introduce the bill and shepherd it toward a vote. Meanwhile, the coalition members stage press conferences, call-your-lawmaker events, and public rallies in target legislative districts, inviting their members—the very workers and community members who helped shape the bill—to show up. Seeing this fight as their own, many people do just that, and the ample turnout catches the eye of swing legislators.

Meanwhile, advocates from the coalition’s labor, faith, community, and environmental organizations traipse across the state capitol, lobbying undecided legislators who have sympathies with their particular constituency. Representatives unconvinced by climate arguments are swayed by housing affordability pitches, and vice versa.

A Policy by and for Working People

After a cross-movement advocacy, organizing, and media blitz, a majority of “aye” votes in the state capitol lands the new housing policy—built by and for impacted workers and communities—in the history books. A year later, union workers are starting to build multifamily housing projects that offer low-cost, energy-efficient units, helping families across the state find affordable and healthy homes.

But affordable green housing is not the only thing that has grown. More working families in the state now see themselves in the clean energy transition. Thousands of members of unions and community organizations have just spent months gathering in school gyms, union halls, and church basements to shape legislation that marries climate and economic solutions. Many have hoisted placards at rallies and placed calls to state legislators to urge passage of the resulting bill. And with its passage, many of them—and their co-workers and neighbors—stand to benefit from lower costs or higher wages.

Participatory policy design still requires policy wonks. We wonks just need to do things a bit differently.

True, that doesn’t mean most participating union and community group members are likely to become card-carrying climate activists. But might they vocally support the next bill that advances pro-affordability, pro-worker climate solutions, or a candidate who does? The odds are good. And so the tentpoles of the nation’s climate constituency expand outwards.

As this hypothetical process indicates, participatory policy design still requires policy wonks. We wonks just need to do things a bit differently. First and foremost, a bottom-up approach calls for us to listen: to believe people as they describe the biggest problems they face, to ask the probing questions required to move from problems to policies, to hear how policy ideas might play out on the ground, and to trust those takes. This will require that we hold lightly our preconceived notions of what works.

Bottom-up policy design will also require meeting people where they are. In the many places where immediate economic and health concerns outrank climate angst, the conversation will not start with “What climate policies do you want?” Instead, the question might be, “What are your biggest household costs?” “What worries you most about the health of your children?” “What kinds of jobs would you like to see more of in your community?” Such entry points can lead to policy solutions that would cut costs, improve health, and boost wages while also expediting the transition to a clean energy economy.

At this point, you might be thinking, “This seems like a lot of work.” Yes, though past practice shows that a participatory process can be just as expedient as traditional policy development, as mentioned. In addition, not all policy decisions need to go through the full participatory process outlined above. Some decisions may call for policymakers to simply engage with a representative set of stakeholders and/or to use digital tools to solicit input from a swath of their constituents.

But for truly game-changing policy plays—where the potential climate, economic, or health impacts are large—a process built on deep and wide participation can help to ensure that: 1) the policy details effectively respond to people’s biggest needs, 2) the policy has sufficient stakeholder support to get enacted, and 3) the policy builds broad buy-in for a larger agenda (e.g., climate action). That helps explain why, despite the labor involved, a growing number of states now have union-community-environmental coalitions dedicated to co-designing climate solutions.

Choosing the Right Ingredients

But such a bottom-up process also raises a question that brings us back to our everything bagel. If we invite a broad array of workers and communities to help design a next wave of clean energy investments, do we think that they are likely to come up with a policy that focuses singularly on gigawatts of clean energy buildout? No, probably not. They may care about how that buildout translates into reduced energy, housing, or transportation costs for their families. Or into wider availability of high-paying jobs. Or a reduction in air pollution. In short, they may add a few ingredients to the bagel.

Additional ingredients, as mentioned, tend to be a pet peeve of some “abundance” proponents, who fear they will get in the way of building things. Some, in fact, caution against broad stakeholder involvement in policy design to avoid this very outcome. But that counsel—essentially an endorsement of closed-door policymaking—presumes that stakeholders, and the policymakers who work with them, will choose contradictory and counterproductive ingredients. Why assume that stakeholders are incapable of choosing congruent ingredients?

To be clear, some ingredients must indeed be discarded as incompatible with policy goals. To address the housing affordability crisis, for example, “abundance” proponents are right that we need to eliminate regressive policies, like exclusionary zoning, that hamper new housing while also undermining equity. But that doesn’t mean we must also eschew housing provisions that support climate, jobs, or equity goals, so long as they’re crafted in a way that does not meaningfully deter construction. We can target the bathwater while protecting the baby.

A well-structured participatory policy design process can do just that. That process starts with intentionally building coalitions around aligned interests. For example, the coalition described above—composed of affordable housing advocates, construction unions, climate groups, and environmental justice organizations—would likely see eye to eye on rejecting exclusionary zoning, which undermines affordability, jobs, climate, and equity goals alike. By contrast, a haphazard approach to coalition building that invites participation from groups with diametrically opposing goals—say, local NIMBY groups and affordable housing campaigners—would likely end in fundamental disagreements instead of policy coherence.

Thanks to its more deliberate formation, our hypothetical coalition may find common ground in not only opposing exclusionary zoning but also welcoming certain other ingredients for housing policy design. For example, they might recommend the creation of a state-level program that offers affordable housing grants to cities, contingent on adoption of inclusionary zoning, high-road labor standards for construction workers, and energy-efficient, climate-resilient building codes that reduce utility bills, home insurance rates, and indoor air pollution for tenants.

The diversity of these policy objectives does not preclude them from meshing well. For example, the preference for climate-smart design would not detract from the goal of rapidly building affordable housing. A recent study found that it costs less to build an all-electric, low-emissions home than a conventional home in nine out of nine U.S. cities analyzed. Other studies agree. The data show that we need not pick between building affordable or low-emissions housing—we can do both.

In fact, the residents of such electrified homes can expect to save money on their upfront costs and utility bills, with savings over 15 years ranging from about $2,000 in Boston to more than $10,000 in New York. Those residents will also breathe cleaner air while their homes emit between 20 and 50 percent less climate pollution. Such win-win potential is the target of participatory design.

Navigating Tradeoffs

But win-win solutions are not always so easy to come by. A participatory design model—like nearly any policy design initiative—will still need to grapple with policy tradeoffs. The question is: Can stakeholders negotiate those tradeoffs to arrive at shared solutions?

Consider the case of labor standards for affordable housing policies. Unions have good reason to push for such standards. Construction workers are paid lower than average wages, resulting in higher than average reliance on welfare. Many face illegal wage theft and denial of basic benefits. In Minnesota, for example, companies use under-the-table payments or worker misclassification to evade basic labor protections for roughly one out of every four construction workers, resulting in a 36 percent average reduction in those workers’ earnings. A number of the state’s affordable housing projects have relied on contractors with a track record of such tactics. To help remedy the situation, last year Minnesota enacted a new, union-backed policy establishing a wage floor for construction workers on publicly funded affordable housing projects.

However, such an outcome is precisely what some “abundance” proponents worry about. Concerned about the potential for labor costs to undercut affordable housing goals, some have suggested that workers should not have a seat at the table in designing affordable housing policies. But this stance ignores one of the key benefits of participatory policy design: the opportunity for on-the-ground experts to bring together contrasting but reconcilable perspectives so as to make informed decisions about policy tradeoffs.

Take, for example, the policy tensions that unions and affordable housing groups grappled with in jointly designing Los Angeles’s mansion tax, which taxes high-value properties to fund affordable housing. The policy design was truly bottom-up, with a broad coalition of local housing and labor advocates meeting on Zoom calls to negotiate the details.

Construction unions and affordable housing developers in California had historically been at odds over labor standards for low-income housing projects. But seeing an opportunity to win a policy that could deliver on both sides’ goals, union and affordable housing leaders worked to arrive at a compromise regarding project labor agreements, yielding a mansion tax framework that melded jobs and affordability objectives. The central role of local unions and affordable housing groups in the policy design process allowed for direct negotiation between impacted constituencies, whose on-the-ground expertise helped surface creative options for navigating policy tradeoffs.

Thanks to the participatory process, the resulting policy enjoyed broad buy-in from unions and affordable housing groups, which then powered a robust citywide campaign to push for passage via a ballot measure. The push overcame corporate opposition to garner majority support from voters in 2022. While not free of tradeoffs, today the mansion tax is Los Angeles’s largest revenue source for affordable housing, and the first tranche of affordable housing projects funded by the tax is expected to create 10,000 union jobs.

Yes, bottom-up processes are likely to initially produce many ingredients for our bagel, some of which may clash. But if we are aiming for the optimal policy—the one that can yield the greatest good and enjoy enough support to pass—the answer is not for a few remote policy professionals to trash ingredients in favor of a single-minded, plain-tasting alternative. The answer is to equip workers and communities to weigh the tradeoffs alongside policymakers so as to write a coherent recipe.

The Architects of Our New Climate Agenda

If we’re open to well-crafted everything bagels, today’s brewing state policy campaigns and clean energy project pipelines present a near-term opportunity for workers and communities to become the architects of the climate movement’s next big thing. Seizing this opportunity will require strong organizing and smart participatory design processes. But the potential prize is large: a suite of new clean energy policies and projects by and for impacted communities, and expanded ownership of climate solutions. These are the building blocks for a national climate agenda that responds to on-the-ground priorities and enjoys broad backing—an agenda we can win.

By building policy and power at the same time, we can lay the groundwork for the next federal governing moment so that we’re ready when the carnage of this Administration ends. A bottom-up offense won’t be easy. It will be messy. It will require overcoming steep odds. But none of that is new for the climate movement.",https://democracyjournal.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/climate-agenda-resize.jpg,N,,2025-09-17 17:00:47.473306

It’s a fact that fossil fuel-based energy continues to fuel the warming of the planet. With that warming comes an increased frequency of extreme weather events. The solutions to achieve carbon neutrality and energy security depend on the deployment of more renewable energy, continued energy efficiencies, and resilience measures. But actions by the current federal administration are holding back progress, while putting people and their communities at higher risk.

That’s where the organization Elected Officials to Protect America comes in. It is a network of current and former bipartisan elected officials who care deeply about protecting our planet and democracy with education on energy security solutions.

The Extreme Weather That Many Lawmakers Refuse To Acknowledge

Destructive wildfires, droughts, heat waves, extreme storms, flash floods, and infectious diseases cause economic and emotional distress.

At the Tempe Public Library complex, where solar arrays provide more than 70% of the complex’s power needs, the Elected Officials organization is meeting this week with the Climate Action Campaign (CAC). The Tempe Public Library project includes roof solar panels, carport canopies that provide 262 shaded parking spaces, and a large solar canopy that is used as a community gathering space for festivals, events, and farmers markets. It also offers solar protection panels for wheelchair access. Tempe’s library complex solar panels produce 1.3 million kWh of energy, which is equivalent to reducing carbon emissions by more than 900 metric tons and taking 190 vehicles off the road each year.

The library is an appropriate location for the press conference, as it demonstrates how solar is a natural fit for Arizona. But not so fast — a major $156,120,000 Solar-For-All grant was rescinded for Arizona, alongside other federally funded clean energy projects.

Thank the Trump Administration.

Tempe city leaders had established a 100% clean energy goal by 2035 and worked with the federal government to secure needed grant funding for some clean energy projects. “Sadly, that dynamic has changed,” said Christian Brock, Elected Officials to Protect America senior advisor and Air Force veteran.

As a clean and renewable power source fueling the library, solar has another plus: it costs less than a traditional power source. “Thousands have enjoyed the solar panel shaded outdoor gathering place for neighborhood events,” said Corey Woods, Tempe Mayor. “Every summer we are experiencing far too many dangerously hot days. We know with the added risk of extreme heat, utility bills skyrocket. Federal funding from the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program and the Weatherization Assistance Program have been critical to help Arizona residents who live on fixed incomes.”

“Every community across the state needs federal funding for clean energy initiatives, energy efficiencies, and climate protection,” the mayor added.

Is Solar For All A Pipe Dream?

The concern now is that Arizona will not be able to meet its clean energy goals, which will hurt families and businesses; marginalized communities may suffer the most. The Elected Officials group is advocating for the release of clean energy grant funding for more renewable energy projects in Arizona, like Solar for All.

The Tempe Solar for All award was part of the historic $27 billion Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, developed under the Inflation Reduction Act to lower US families’ energy costs, create good-quality jobs in communities — including historically disadvantaged communities, advance environmental justice, and tackle the climate crisis. The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) provided over $369 billion in tax breaks, incentives, grants, and loan guarantees that were designed to mitigate the climate crisis, which impacts communities daily with weather extremes and poor air quality.

Just last month, the three largest utilities in Arizona saw record peak demands as residents cranked up the air conditioning during extreme heat. The Solar for All program’s planned 61 megawatts of solar would have helped meet the state’s growing demand and prevent outages while creating quality jobs. Without the Solar for All program, eligible Arizonans will lose out on an average of 20% in annual energy bill savings per participating household, $11 million to support workforce development programs, and new solar deployment.

The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) is navigating several other federal policy actions. On July 15, the Department of the Interior issued a memo stating that Interior Secretary Doug Burgum will need to personally sign off on numerous types of federal permitting approvals for a solar project to move forward. Additionally, the US Treasury issued new guidance on August 15 that made changes to the formal definition of “beginning of construction” for solar projects to earn federal tax credits.

Nonetheless, the US solar industry installed nearly 18 gigawatts (GW) of new capacity in the first half of 2025. Even as the Trump administration rolled out a series of anti-clean energy policies, solar and storage still accounted for 82% of all new power added to the grid in its first six months.

Loss Of Important Federal Agencies Hurts Renewable Uptick & Everyday Citizens

Elected officials and CAC say that challenges Arizonans face require a fully funded, fully staffed, and politically independent federal response. However, Trump 2.0 has vowed to end the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), and the Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP). His administration has stripped the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) of its core mission.

Attacks on these agencies jeopardize clean air, safe water, and climate pollution limits that protect public health. The Elected Officials organization challenges the Trump administration, insisting that they failed to recognize the climate crisis as a threat multiplier in their 2025 threat assessment — despite previously acknowledging the danger during Trump’s first term.

Assistant Minority Leader, State Rep. Nancy Gutierrez, explained that, “it’s Arizona families who pay the price. The stress, polluted air, higher utility bills, and fewer outside local jobs are the result. On the other hand, clean energy investments save families money, bring cleaner air and can help mitigate weather extremes. We must do everything in our power to protect people from climate crisis dangers. Every dollar stripped away from clean-energy programs,” she continued, “is a dollar stolen from the prosperity, health, and security of families.”

Final Thoughts

The Elected Officials group — which represents 1313 officials in 50 states — argues that the need for energy security solutions has never been greater. Elected officials at all levels of government are joining together to educate their peers and communities on clean energy solutions that will protect people and the planet. The group helps facilitate those connections with educational opportunities, training, and gatherings at home and abroad. The Elected Officials organization educates lawmakers through value-based storytelling; it is the only national organization that mobilizes veterans who are lawmakers to work together on energy security solutions.

T.R. Ludwig, CEO of Brooklyn SolarWorks, didn’t see the second of a one-two punch coming. As the industry was losing federal support, the government of New York announced it would reallocate funds after overachieving its distributed-generation goal.

“A lot of us were rather focused on the federal stuff, because we knew that that was going to start to heat up and get adversarial,” said Ludwig, a board member of New York Solar Energy Industries Association. “So, nobody was terribly focused on what was happening at the state level.”

State policy is integral to solar. Its incentives can determine whether solar prospers or falters in the state. But more importantly, its power can make or break whether solar developments are even allowed in the state to begin with.

Every two years, every state’s bill session aligns during the spring, and this year, energy bills dominated many lawmakers’ discussions. The outcome was a mixed bag, with bills bringing solar sunrises and sunsets across the country.

State policy has always been a front line for energy in the United States. With the loss of federal incentives this has never been truer, according to Jeff Cramer, president and CEO of the Coalition for Community Solar Access.

Community solar

Roughly half of the United States does not have policies to enable community solar. Several states introduced bills this year to implement community solar, but every bill in a state without year-long sessions failed.

In Montana, Republican-backed community solar legislation made it as far as the governor’s desk – having previously failed to make it to a first vote in either chamber – but was ultimately vetoed.

Meanwhile, Minnesota nearly lost its newly revamped community solar program after three senators – two Democrats and one Republican – introduced legislation to repeal it. David Moberg, policy and regulatory affairs associate, Minnesota Solar Energy Industries Association, described it as “probably the most frustrating” bill of the session.

Supporters were concerned that an early sunset for the community solar program could signal problems in other states, too. Minnesota’s challenges mirror those seen elsewhere: bipartisan and broad public support for solar, but with opposition from utilities. However, Minnesota is so far the only state in 2025 whose lawmakers or governor did not side with utilities over community solar. The state’s successes and challenges can serve as a template for campaigners in other states seeking to overcome opposition from utilities.

Why not every state has community solar

There are 19 states with deregulated energy markets and 15 (79%) have succeeded in adopting community solar legislation – lawmakers are inching close in the remaining four. In contrast, less than 20% of states with regulated energy markets have passed community solar legislation.

Investor-owned utilities are usually the sole opponents to testify against community solar bills. Ohio lawmakers spent nearly a year holding hearings for a community solar bill, with more than 70 testimonies from residents and stakeholders representing an array of industries in support of the bill, while the utilities were among the few to testify in opposition.

In deregulated energy markets where utilities are forbidden from owning generation, objections from utilities become quieter, if they raise any at all.

“For every megawatt that a third-party community solar developer develops, that’s a megawatt of regulated rate of return that they cannot develop,” said Jeff Cramer, president and CEO of the Coalition for Community Solar Access. “They like to spin everybody up into knots and tell narratives of cost shift and how it’s going to be unreliable for the grid and this and that. They scare everybody, but ultimately, it’s about their own self-interest.”

The utility business model is to make more regulated rate of returns on more dollars, Cramer argued. “I don’t blame them for that, but it is a big problem in the sense of trying to bring new, innovative, competitive products into these vertically integrated states,” he said.

Microgrids

Virginia has the largest data-center market in the world, according to the state’s Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission. The state does not produce enough energy to meet demand, importing 61% of its electricity between 2018 and 2023, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

Virginia’s House of Representatives and Senate passed legislation in April 2025 to triple the state’s energy storage capacity. However, Governor Glenn Youngkin vetoed the new law, along with most other clean energy bills, such as a bill to increase rooftop solar and other forms of distributed power.

West Virginia has since passed legislation designed to lure data centers across the border. It has eased restrictions on microgrid development and created a certified microgrid program. The new law makes it easier for companies, especially data centers, to build independent microgrids. It creates special “microgrid districts” that are exempt from many local zoning regulations and allows generated power to be used on-site or sold wholesale.

Oregon has also passed microgrid legislation that enables entities beyond utilities to own and operate microgrids.

Net metering

In California and Maine, net metering programs have been under fire, with two high-profile bills proving controversial. California’s net metering was set to affect homeowners with rooftop solar installations, while Maine’s targeted ratepayers who have installations or who subscribe to community solar projects.

California’s bill would have switched the existing net-metering agreements into the state’s new net-metering structure, which pays about 80% less for the electricity sent to the grid. After lawmakers changed the legislation to only mandate the switch when a home is sold, the bill was eventually amended to remove the net-metering changes entirely.

In Maine, lawmakers have made community solar and other front-of-the-meter projects ineligible for the current net-metering structure. State law tasks the Governor’s Energy Office with developing a successor program and also imposes a monthly fee that community solar project owners must pay to utilities.

Automated permitting

New York, Illinois, Minnesota, Hawaii, New Jersey, Colorado, Florida, and Texas all worked to pass bills to speed up permitting decisions for residential solar installations. Although the bills shared the same objective – to push sluggish municipalities into a streamlined process – every bill that required the adoption of automated permitting software failed. New Jersey’s passage of a smart permitting bill was the only exception.

Texas and Florida succeeded by taking a different approach that works within their state’s existing framework. It allows contractors to conduct inspections, including the use of automated permitting software, if a city or municipality fails to make a decision on a permitting application after a prescribed number of days.

Solar defense Solar and energy storage are big in Texas, but a trio of bills threatened progress. Texas Senate Bill 819 would have placed additional fees, permitting restrictions, setback requirements, and regulatory mandates exclusively on utility-scale solar and wind projects.

Another bill required at least half of all new generation to come from “dispatchable generation other than energy storage.” The third bill aimed to retroactively mandate existing renewable energy installations to install a backup energy source. All three bills died after stalling in the legislature.",https://pv-magazine-usa.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/TexasStateCapitol-2010-02-1200x857.jpg,N,,2025-09-17 18:06:23.452404

The state on Wednesday announced plans to release $18 million it received after successfully suing the Trump administration for withholding the funds that Congress had already allocated.

The 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law signed by former President Joe Biden contained $148 million for Illinois to build more EV charging stations. The state received $25.3 million to build charging stations at 37 locations in 2024 as part of the first round of grant funding.

But the Federal Highway Administration withheld the second round earlier this year after President Donald Trump signed an executive order requiring federal agencies to pause funding for clean energy projects appropriated in the Biden-era law.

Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul and 16 other attorneys general sued the Trump administration in May seeking the release of the funds. The lawsuit argued it is illegal for the president to withhold funding that has already been approved by Congress. A judge ruled in June that the federal government must release the funds to Illinois and other states that joined the lawsuit.

“Illinois has been at the forefront of building a clean energy economy that creates jobs and helps lower costs for consumers, and building electric vehicle chargers across the states has been core to that mission,” Gov. JB Pritzker said in a statement. “I’m thankful for the quick action of our Attorney General in the fight to restore these funds that President Trump was unlawfully withholding.”

Pritzker’s office announced on Wednesday that Illinois will receive $18.4 million this year as part of the second round of grant funding for EV chargers. The money will fund 167 charging stations at 25 locations. With the release and allocation of the federal funding, Illinois will have received $43.8 million from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to build 349 charging ports in 62 locations.

1 million electric vehicles

State officials said expanding charging locations will help the state achieve its goal of having one million electric vehicles registered in Illinois by 2030.

Locations along interstates throughout Illinois have been selected for the second round of grant funding, including at Wally’s gas station in Pontiac along Interstate 55 and at a Target in Gurnee off Interstate 94.

One of the largest disbursements will be a $910,287 grant for chargers at Eric’s Too Family Restaurant and Lounge near the interchange of Interstate 55 and Interstate 74 in Bloomington.

The funding is made possible through the second round of the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) program, which is helping to invest in communities and generate economic development while advancing our goal to have a million EVs registered in Illinois by 2030. ​

“Illinois has been at the forefront of building a clean energy economy that creates jobs and helps lower costs for consumers, and building electric vehicle chargers across the states has been core to that mission,” said Governor JB Pritzker. “I’m thankful for the quick action of our Attorney General in the fight to restore these funds that President Trump was unlawfully withholding. With these resources rightfully coming back to Illinois, I look forward to taking another step forward in our continued efforts to expand EV infrastructure and boosting local economies across Illinois.”

As part of the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act passed by Congress and signed into law in 2021, Illinois is set to receive a total of $148 million through NEVI to build out an EV charging network, first along interstate corridors, followed by more local locations. Gov. Pritzker announced the initial round of $25.3 million in NEVI awards last year to build 37 charging stations. ​

In May, Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul joined 16 other attorneys general in suing the Federal Highway Administration for withholding the remainder of the appropriated funds. A judge in June ordered the administration to release funding appropriated to Illinois and 13 other states. ​ ​ ​

“In May, I joined 16 state attorneys general in suing the Trump administration for unlawfully holding critical National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Formula Program funding – which is appropriated by Congress – hostage,” said Attorney General Kwame Raoul. “Our coalition obtained a court order requiring the administration to release NEVI funds that states including Illinois are counting on to construct EV charging stations and improve safety for drivers traveling long distances. I am pleased that our coalition’s work has resulted in this money finally reaching Illinois, which ultimately boosts our state’s economy.”

The NEVI program is part of a series of comprehensive initiatives to achieve our goal of becoming a leader in manufacturing and deploying EVs. In addition to making travel by EVs more reliable and accessible, the funding advances Pritzker Administration’s commitment to make the state an EV industry leader, fight climate change and create jobs. ​

“When Senate Democrats passed the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act back in 2021, we voted to send the resources and funding to our home states to build new, better infrastructure. ​ Because of the IIJA, more than $18 million is coming to Illinois to support electric vehicle charging stations,” said U.S. Senator Dick Durbin (D-IL). ​ “After months of battling the Trump Administration’s unconscionable freeze of this critical funding, Illinois is finally seeing its fair share of support from the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure program. This funding is a continuation of Illinois state leaders shared goal to help reduce carbon emissions, ease the transition to clean power sources, and combat the climate crisis.”

“When we passed the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law we brought vital investment home to Illinois,” said U.S. Senator Tammy Duckworth (D-IL). “While the Trump Administration is focused on trying to illegally claw back already-appropriated federal funding, I’m committed to working alongside Governor Pritzker, Senator Durbin and our state and local leaders to hold the Administration accountable and ensure our communities receive the federal resources promised. This funding will help expand access to reliable charging stations for electric vehicles, critical in helping invest in Illinois’s clean energy future and making EV use more accessible for all Illinoisans.”

“We will not stop our efforts to build an accessible and reliable electric vehicle charging network across our state,” said Illinois Transportation Secretary Gia Biagi. ​ “These charging stations not only provide transportation options, but also economic opportunity for cities and towns throughout Illinois.”

“This is an important step forward in building Illinois’ clean energy economy,” said Illinois Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity Director Kristin Richards. “These investments not only expand our electric vehicle charging network, but they also drive our continued growth in the EV manufacturing sector, from automakers and suppliers to the skilled workers powering the transition.”

“The NEVI-funded chargers along Illinois’ interstate corridors are critical to building a reliable statewide backbone of fast-charging infrastructure to continue the critical growth of electric vehicle deployment in Illinois. These stations directly complement the Illinois EPA’s efforts, which have supported more than 450 charging locations across the state,” said Illinois EPA Director James Jennings. “Together, state agencies are working to offer EV drivers multiple charging options at numerous locations, ensuring accessible and convenient travel throughout Illinois.""

The 25 projects throughout the state were chosen via a competitive call for projects held last fall. The awards will facilitate the construction of 167 new charging ports. Selected locations will have at least four DC fast charging ports, each of which can fully charge a typical EV from empty in less than 30 minutes. ​ Among the charging stations to be built:

“This type of charging infrastructure will not only increase the number of charging stations, but it will enhance our energy sources for the Bloomington community as well,” said Bloomington Mayor Dan Brady.

“We’re very pleased to get a Level 3 charger for the Springfield area for EV drivers along the I-55 corridor,” said Springfield Mayor Misty Buscher. “Projects like this complement what we are doing inside our community for smart city infrastructure to meet the needs of our citizens and visitors.”

A total of $148 million has been allocated to IDOT to deliver the NEVI program in Illinois. ​ To date, IDOT has awarded $43.8 million in NEVI grants for 62 projects throughout the state, which will facilitate the construction of 349 new charging ports. The entire list can be viewed at Drive Electric Illinois or by visiting idot.click/drive-electric. All of the awards are contingent on the selected recipients entering into a grant agreement with IDOT. ​

The next application period for funding is anticipated in late 2025. For more information on NEVI in Illinois, visit Drive Electric Illinois or email dot.driveelectric@illinois.gov.

The site will serve a number of purposes, including building the future workforce for the advanced nuclear industry. The Wyoming Natrium project is a crucial part of the Trump administration’s plans to increase energy independence and shift the United States away from reliance on energy from the outside world. The administration has been on a tear in recent months since signing several executive orders aimed directly at the energy sector.

TerraPower views the Natrium project as a crucial milestone in nuclear production

The site will host operation training activities and support all operator-accredited programs, as well as several operational activities. The nuclear energy sector has received a massive boost thanks to the Trump administration’s executive orders and policies that aim to revitalize the energy sector in the United States by bypassing the traditional environmental regulations that the sector has been hindered by.

Some of the planned operations that the site will host are:

Housing the Natrium Training Simulator

Laboratories for Electrical and Instrumentation & Control (I&C)

Mechanical and scientific laboratories

Training classrooms

“The future of energy will only come to fruition if we have a skilled, dedicated and robust workforce. The Kemmerer Training Center will serve as the central hub for future Natrium operators who will deliver the reliable and flexible power communities need. We are proud to be building this facility on the site of our first Natrium plant. The proximity between the plant and the training center, along with the ongoing support of the Kemmerer community, are invaluable as we continue to advance America’s next nuclear power plant.” – Chris Levesque, TerraPower President and CEO

Wyoming could become the center of the nuclear sector in the United States

Wyoming is not the biggest state in the union, and as such, it has faced several challenges in the energy production sector, along with the rest of America. The company broke ground on the site in 2024 and immediately started construction. The project is the only advanced nuclear developer to begin construction on a commercial-scale project in the U.S.

It features some innovative storage capacity that enables the site to deliver 500 MW of power when needed and is being developed through the U.S. Department of Energy’s Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program (ARDP), a public-private partnership. Wyoming’s state government has welcomed the plans to construct the nuclear site. The project is a prime example of the new safety and efficiency improvements in the nuclear sector in recent years.

“Wyoming is leading the way in establishing the next generation nuclear sector,. With today’s announcement at the Natrium site on the beginning of construction on the training center, Southwest Wyoming has much to celebrate — from workforce opportunities to state-of-the-art energy production.” – Wyoming Governor Mark Gordon

There are currently 43 proposed carbon capture and sequestration projects in Louisiana, one of the few states to be awarded primary enforcement authority (or primacy) for the regulation of Class VI injection wells by the federal EPA. This means that, unlike many other states, the LDENR is in charge of the permit application review and approval process, allowing for more local control over proposed projects. Although the Hackberry approval is the culmination of a nearly 1.5-year permitting process, subsequent permitting actions should benefit from the LDNR’s early rigorous review process, reducing future permitting timelines to less than one year.

Carbon capture and sequestration projects have become increasingly prevalent, offering stakeholders innovative strategies for managing CO2emissions. In a time when investors, customers, and governmental authorities often pressure industry to decrease CO2emissions, these projects present opportunities for companies to participate in domestic and foreign carbon reduction incentives. When paired with power generation facilities, carbon capture and sequestration can compound multiple benefits, contributing to national energy independence, producing clean, carbon-neutral energy, and creating credits eligible for sale in carbon markets worldwide

Carbon capture and sequestration projects involve capturing CO2before it is emitted from industrial facilities, transporting it to a permitted injection well, and injecting it deep underground for storage so that it cannot escape into the atmosphere. In addition to receiving a Class VI permit, before the capture, transportation, and injection of CO2may be carried out, emitting companies, operators, and landowners will enter into various agreements creating the necessary rights and obligations to undertake these activities and allocating the risks related thereto. Before entering into any such agreement, there are many issues all parties will need to consider, including ones raised by state officials.

Understanding the political headwinds, the varying regulatory regimes, and securing the appropriate legal services will be crucial to effectively navigating the risks in this new and complex environment.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.16379_2152.jpg,N,,2025-09-17 15:01:29.978992

How the credits work The federal tax credits are complicated and have changed several times in recent years.
Used vehicles that are at least two years old and sold for less than $25,000 could qualify for a $4,000 credit.
“The government says they want to move forward with green clean energy and move forward with electric cars, yet they’re taking away the incentive to buy the electric cars in the first place,” McMullen said.
“If there’s no incentive financially to get one through a tax credit, we have to look at other options as a business.” There is another EV-related credit that is set to expire.","HILLSBOROUGH CO., Fla. — It’s almost the end of the road for drivers to get federal electric vehicle tax credits worth up to $7,500.

President Donald Trump passed the One Big Beautiful Act earlier this year, which ends the EV tax credits on Sept. 30. Before that, the credits were set to expire in 2032.

As the new deadline draws closer, Tampa area dealerships are seeing an uptick in sales.

“We advertise it like crazy, it’s all over our website, get it while it lasts,” said Rob Verhey, the New Car Director at Volvo Cars Tampa.

Verhey said in the months since the new expiration date was announced, they’ve seen a 30% increase in electric and plug-in hybrid car sales.

“The way car prices are, that $7,500 tax credit is very enticing for a lot of people who want to make that segway into the electric car market,” Verhey added.

Eligibility for the credit varies, but Verhey said at Volvo, they’re being offered on leases for EVs and plug-in hybrids. He said on top of the credit, the dealer is offering more savings, and for some cars, it’s making a big difference.

“The EX90, it qualifies for almost $15,000 in rebates right now,” Verhey said, talking about Volvo’s largest electric SUV.

How the credits work

The federal tax credits are complicated and have changed several times in recent years.

New car buyers and leases can be eligible for a rebate at the dealer, as opposed to having to file for the credit on their taxes.

For buying a new vehicle, the MSRP must be under $80,000 for an SUV and $55,000 for a sedan, wagon, or hatchback.

Used vehicles that are at least two years old and sold for less than $25,000 could qualify for a $4,000 credit.

There are restrictions on manufacturing for cars made in North America and containing batteries with a percentage of components that come from the U.S. and certain allied countries

To qualify for a federal tax credit, the buyer’s income after taxes can’t be above $300,000 for those who file as married or above $150,000 for anyone filing as single or separately.

For people who choose to lease, the $7,500 credit can be used toward any EV without restrictions on the sticker price, manufacturing, or buyer income.

Drivers see a roadblock

Some drivers are disappointed to see the tax credits expire.

Matthew McMullen’s family runs the driving school, Driving Made Easy, which recently added an EV to their fleet.

“The car is relatively inexpensive, and then the tax incentive made it really nice to buy,” McMullen said. “You get a big chunk of the car back right away, so your overhead goes down right away.”

McMullen said that without the tax credits, any plans they had to add more EVs to their driving school are being curbed.

“The government says they want to move forward with green clean energy and move forward with electric cars, yet they’re taking away the incentive to buy the electric cars in the first place,” McMullen said. “If there’s no incentive financially to get one through a tax credit, we have to look at other options as a business.”

There is another EV-related credit that is set to expire. Drivers can have a home charger installed for a $1,000 rebate or up to 30 percent of the cost of the project, whichever is less. That credit ends on June 30, 2026.",https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f124f6d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1280x672+0+24/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fewscripps-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F3f%2F6e%2F1a2335ec43da9d88f892682f7d86%2Fposter-image-13.jpg,N,,2025-09-17 18:05:41.778755

The agreement marks NYK's second purchase of credits from the company and is intended to address the shipping firm's residual operational emissions.

This deal highlights how direct air capture (DAC) technology is being integrated into the decarbonization strategies of industries that are challenging to decarbonize, such as international shipping.

The maritime industry emits approximately one billion tons of carbon dioxide annually, according to NYK, and estimates that if 10% of these emissions remain after operational reductions, the industry would require the removal of 100 million tons of carbon dioxide each year via CDR. .

""Together with 1PointFive, we aim to contribute not only to the decarbonization of international shipping, but to decarbonization worldwide,"" said Akira Kono, Representative Director, Executive Vice-President Executive Officer of NYK.

He added that the company is actively pursuing a multifaceted approach to reduce emissions, including using fuel-efficient vessels, adopting low-carbon fuels, and improving operational efficiency.

Kono stated that DAC is necessary to address the ""residual emissions that cannot be eliminated through operational or technological improvements alone.""

The CDR credits purchased by NYK will be generated by STRATOS, 1PointFive’s first DAC facility, which is under construction in Texas. The facility is on track to begin operations this year and is designed to capture up to 500,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide per year. The captured CO2 will either be stored deep underground or used for enhanced oil recovery.

The development of DAC technology and the market for CDR credits represent a growing segment of the energy transition, offering a way for companies to offset emissions that are difficult to mitigate.

And while much of the new demand for energy is being met by renewables, the reliability requirements of especially data centers has prompted a surge of demand for gas.
And these are prices that will largely trickle down to utility customers in the form of higher bills.
The delays and higher prices are not just a function of the OEMs exercising their pricing power, however.
Nearly all components of a fossil gas power plant — from transformers to switchgears to iron and steel piping — have gotten pricier in the last decade.","Demand for gas turbines is soaring — and the price of a combined-cycle gas turbine is too, new research finds. Projects slated for completion in 2030 or 2031 are now “routinely reporting costs of $2,000 per kilowatt or more,” a jump of as much as 75% over near-term prices.

(As a point of comparison, projects that are slated to come online in the coming years reported costs of between $1,116 per kW and $1,427 per kW.)

These findings are the result of a collaboration of GridLab, Energy Futures Group, Component Reliability Consultants, and Halcyon. In their recent report, the authors attempt to put numbers to the anecdotes of rising prices for gas infrastructure, which is a surprisingly difficult task given that costs are also kept confidential in integrated resource plans and other public documents.

By pulling together what little data is available, though, the researchers provide a fuller picture of a market staggering under an unexpected boom in demand, one that is “a stark departure from historical cost assumptions and public cost projections.”

A combination of electrification, onshoring, and data centers has caused the U.S. to enter a period of major load growth. And while much of the new demand for energy is being met by renewables, the reliability requirements of especially data centers has prompted a surge of demand for gas.

“These elevated costs are likely to persist rather than decline, at least in the short-midterm,” the authors wrote; they add that this conclusion is supported by the financial reports of major gas turbine OEMs like GE Vernova, Siemens Energy, and Mitsubishi Power, who “are reporting strong demand and robust order backlogs.”

These three OEMs, they found, now require a reservation fee to secure a manufacturing slot; two Kentucky utilities, for instance, paid GE Vernova a $25 million reservation fee to reserve a turbine to be delivered in time for a facility to reach commercial operation in 2030.

And these are prices that will largely trickle down to utility customers in the form of higher bills. Utilities this year have already sought record rate increases, and electricity prices are increasingly a political sticking point.

Predictably, timelines for installing these high-price turbines are also getting longer. New combined-cycle resources often are looking at coming online in 2030 or 2031, a delay that is already complicating the tech industry’s race to build artificial intelligence infrastructure; increasingly, the AI race is a race to secure enough power.

The delays and higher prices are not just a function of the OEMs exercising their pricing power, however. Bottlenecks in engineering, procurement, and construction services (or EPC) are plaguing the energy industry more broadly, and contributing to delays.

And it’s not just the turbines themselves that are becoming more expensive. Nearly all components of a fossil gas power plant — from transformers to switchgears to iron and steel piping — have gotten pricier in the last decade. (The coronavirus pandemic took a particular toll on these supply chains.) Labor costs are also jumping due to inflation and a shortage of skilled workers.

The report warns that relying on outdated price assumptions for gas turbines “can lead to flawed resource planning and underestimation of project budgets.” They recommend that regulators and planners update their cost assumptions accordingly — and prioritize the transparency of any non-proprietary pricing data going forward, including via collaborative forums for stakeholders.

The stakes are high, and not just for individual projects. “The extended timelines for turbine delivery create a significant challenge for meeting future electricity demand, particularly as coal and other older fossil fuel plants are retired,” the authors write. “The need for substantial reservation fees also affects project financing and risk.”

They also recommend that loads like data centers evaluate flexible alternatives to gas, including utility-scale solar, wind, and battery storage.

This echoes the conclusions of certain major utilities that have concluded that renewables are the faster way of meeting the pressures of load growth. NextEra CEO John Ketchum has been particularly vocal about the fact that renewables are still the best option for getting new megawatts onto the grid, and fast — even as the company invests in new gas generation to meet longer-term needs.

“Renewables are here today,” said Ketchum on the company’s January earnings call. “You can build a wind project in 12 months, a storage facility in 15, and, you know, a solar project in 18 months.”",https://www.latitudemedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Latitude-1920px-32-Image-2025-09-17T134257.993.jpg,N,,2025-09-17 15:01:02.867605

For the ARC plant, the team is focusing on two materials that can handle the tokamak’s heat, radiation and mechanical stress, according to the Commonwealth Fusion website.
Fusion Power Expands Other U.S. fusion energy firms also are moving forward to scale up development.
According to sector trade group Fusion Industry Association, global private investment in fusion energy development around the world now totals more than $9.7 billion in about 50 projects, with $2.6 billion raised just last year.
Commonwealth Fusion will collaborate with Oak Ridge National Laboratory through one DOE program, said the company spokeswoman.","As it nears completion of an estimated $500-million nuclear fusion demonstration complex near Boston, developer Commonwealth Fusion Systems has gained $863 million from global tech investors in its latest funding round to also advance work on a planned 400-MW power plant in Virginia to produce fusion energy at commercial scale.

The firm uses high-temperature superconducting magnets developed in partnership with MIT to build what it says are smaller, lower-cost tokamak fusion systems and is on track to produce more output power than input power as early as 2027 at its SPARC pilot site in Devens, Mass. The pilot facility, set to produce from 50- to 100 MW of power, is about 65% complete with ongoing testing and assembly of components, said Bob Mumgaard, Commonwealth Fusion developer CEO and co-founder in a statement.

“This round of capital isn’t just about fusion generally as a concept, it’s about how do we make fusion into a commercial industrial endeavor,"" he told media.

Since installing the 24-ft dia, 75 ton disc-shaped stainless steel cryostat base in March at the SPARC site, the company team is beginning to build “the heart of our fusion energy system,” said Samer Hamade, vice president of projects.

Commonwealth Fusion announced last month that the $863 million raised in a just completed Series B2 fundraising round now has boosted its private investment total to nearly $3 billion since its founding in 2018, which it claims is one-third of all total capital investment in private fusion development projects. The round was ""oversubscribed,"" the company said.

New investors include tech giant Nvidia, Morgan Stanley and a consortium of 12 Japanese energy and financial firms led by Mitsui & Co. Ltd. and Mitsubishi Corp. Existing investors such as Google and Billl Gates-founded Breakthrough Energy Ventures increased their stakes.

Work on ARC, Commonwealth Fusion's larger successor to SPARC and the first commercial grid-scale power plant planned for a site near Richmond, is “in the early stages of approvals and site design,” with plans to be online in the early 2030s, according to a company spokesperson. The new financing will allow Commonwealth Fusion to start plant construction in the 2027-2028 time frame, she estimated.

For the ARC plant, the team is focusing on two materials that can handle the tokamak’s heat, radiation and mechanical stress, according to the Commonwealth Fusion website. These include “a vanadium alloy for the vacuum vessel structure that must withstand the powerful forces within the machine while operating at high temperatures for many years.""

So far, project development has been led by engineering consultant HDR, construction manager Bond Civil and structural engineers Thornton Tomasetti and VHB.

Google also signed on June 30 its first commercial commitment to fusion power, in an agreement with Commonwealth Fusion to purchase 200 MW of power from the ARC plant, comprising half of its planned output, and to have an option for power buys from future plants.

Fusion Power Expands

Other U.S. fusion energy firms also are moving forward to scale up development. Startup Helion Energy, which has $1 billion in private funding, announced in July the start of construction of its first planned power production reactor in Washington state—the 50-MW Orion reactor along the Columbia River set to deliver power into the Pacific Northwest grid.

The company also said it is on track to generate electricity later this year from its Polaris test reactor that was completed in 2024. ""Early testing has been encouraging, and they expect to demonstrate electricity this year,"" a spokesperson told S&P Global. Helion aims to use superheated fuel to produce fast-pulsed reactions that rhythmically change the surrounding magnetic field, directly generating electricity.

Helion has not disclosed the full cost of the project and said it still needs to obtain state permits. The firm touts a signed power supply contract with Microsoft and a $375-million investment from OpenAI CEO Sam Altman.

According to sector trade group Fusion Industry Association, global private investment in fusion energy development around the world now totals more than $9.7 billion in about 50 projects, with $2.6 billion raised just last year.

The U.S. Energy Dept. Energy under former President Joe Biden chose eight fusion developers to receive multiyear grants based on successful completion of a series of technology milestones in commercialization. On Sept. 10, the agency awarded $134 million in new grants under two programs to bolster U.S. leadership in fusion technologies. Commonwealth Fusion will collaborate with Oak Ridge National Laboratory through one DOE program, said the company spokeswoman.

While Energy Secretary Chris Wright has voiced support for fusion, sector proponents seek more funding commitment from the Trump administration and Congressional Republicans.

At a recent conference on the energy transition, Tani Cantil-Sakauye, PPIC president and CEO, moderated a discussion on the economic opportunities and challenges created by California’s energy policies.
“Infrastructure jobs traditionally have been very good jobs.
Cantil-Sakauye questioned how leaders can ensure that the energy transition does not leave any region behind.
Ultimately, “[the energy transition] will take a pallet of resources,” including fossil fuels.","Beyond achieving climate goals, California aims to grow the state’s economy through its transition to renewable energy. At a recent conference on the energy transition, Tani Cantil-Sakauye, PPIC president and CEO, moderated a discussion on the economic opportunities and challenges created by California’s energy policies.

Today, California is “the number one manufacturing state in the country,” said Lance Hastings, president and CEO of the California Manufacturers and Technology Association, and continued growth in the sector revolves around the availability of energy. While industry leaders support ambitious changes for clean energy, Hastings cautioned against current strategies and timelines to meet climate goals, requesting greater collaboration: “We’ll happily sit at the table to find the best way to reduce emissions, in a way that doesn’t disrupt the economy.”

Sustaining jobs amid the energy transition has forced the state to take a hard look at its energy reality, according to Lorena Gonzalez Fletcher, president of the California Federation of Labor Unions (AFL-CIO). Despite legislation to phase out refineries, the state continues using oil, especially for cars; furthermore, the refineries have provided middle class jobs.

“When we use California oil … it is the cleanest. It is utilizing the best labor standards in the world,” Gonzalez Fletcher said. While California still relies on oil, the state needs to retain refinery workers as well as create “a workforce within renewable energy [with] good middle class jobs, ensuring the same standards [from] the fossil fuel industry are available to the next generation of workers.”

Meanwhile, the switch to renewable energy may fuel growth in the building sector because “the amount of building we have to do is massive,” said Ana Matosantos, managing director at Boston Consulting Group. “Infrastructure jobs traditionally have been very good jobs. The good news is we have enough land and enough water … to power the grid [we will] need. What we do not have is the pace of building” to do that, which requires clarity, foresight, and flexibility with plans—from training to purchasing.

Cantil-Sakauye questioned how leaders can ensure that the energy transition does not leave any region behind.

With projects like large-scale solar, lithium, and offshore wind, “there is a lot of opportunity for places that we don’t normally think of as job centers,” Gonzalez Fletcher said. “We have to make sure jobs are subject to the same standards as those that existed before—with collective bargaining, good wages, and health care.”

Hastings touted the good pay and career mobility available in the manufacturing sector, saying, “You can have a good job anywhere in the state if it’s the right job. The right job is one that contributes to the community and the economy—those are manufacturing jobs.”

“Sometimes we think about climate and economic opportunity as being at odds,” Matosantos said. “To invest in what we need to fuel our system and our energy, it’s a huge opportunity to … expand opportunities across the state. We need land and we need space … it can be a way to help lift up more regions.”

“This is an inflection point for California, we’re hearing it in the legislative oversight hearings … in the governor’s plan,” Cantil-Sakauye said. Ultimately, “[the energy transition] will take a pallet of resources,” including fossil fuels. “We still have momentum; we want to be smart about that momentum” to achieve California’s energy and economic goals.

With approximately EUR 50 million in capital investment, the facility was delivered on time and on budget by construction partner Maru Ehitus AS and equipment suppliers. Funding for the project was provided by Elcogen stakeholders, including Baker Hughes, a leading global energy technology company serving the energy industry and various industrial segments, and South Korea’s HD Hyundai, one of the world’s largest industrial conglomerates, renowned for its leadership in shipbuilding, heavy machinery, and energy innovation. The project also received support from the European Innovation Fund, which has committed an additional EUR 25 million to expand capacity under Elcogen’s “ELCO I” initiative.

“As the name implies, ELCO I serves as a flagship model designed to guide future development initiatives globally,” said Õunpuu. “It reflects our broader vision for international expansion and leadership in clean energy solutions,” adding, “We plan to eventually license our technology and manufacturing blueprint to trusted partners. This ensures consistent IP control while enabling local manufacturing – a particularly attractive proposition for markets focused on domestic production and resilient supply chains.”

Driving Forward the Energy Transition

Founded in 2001, Elcogen has grown into a strategic technology partner for global system integrators, supplying the fuel cell and electrolyser components behind many of the world’s most advanced clean energy systems.

Elcogen’s workforce now includes nearly 150 employees from over 20 nationalities, bringing together more than 500 years of combined experience in Solid Oxide technology. The new facility will eventually support the creation of circa. 300 local jobs as Elcogen transitions to mass production and increases global delivery capabilities.

“Yes, we are expanding capacity, but this is also about increasing the performance of our products and reducing costs for our partners across the energy value chain,” said Enn Õunpuu. “This is a facility designed to deliver on the promise of clean energy, now.”

A Global Gathering for a Global Mission

Elcogen’s launch event held on Tuesday September 16th brought together more than 300 guests, including investors, technology partners, and collaborators from across Europe, Asia, and North America. Key attendees included representatives from Baker Hughes, HD Hyundai, the venture capital fund SmartCap, LHV Bank and leading research institutions such as Tartu University and Tallinn University of Technology.

Although unable to attend in person, Jorgo Chatzimarkakis, CEO of Hydrogen Europe, shared a video message with guests at the event, offering his strong support for the launch:

“Estonia has once again proven its extraordinary creativity and productivity in clean-tech innovation. With Elcogen’s new facility, Europe gains a powerful boost in electrolysis and fuel cell capacity – technologies that are inseparable from the hydrogen economy. The roots of excellence now bear fruit on an industrial scale. This makes us proud as Europeans: hydrogen is the people’s molecule, and Estonia shows how to turn vision into reality.”

“This new facility sends a strong message that Elcogen is ready for large scale delivery,” said Chris Nash, Chair of Elcogen’s Board of Directors. “We are committed to partnering with global system integrators, strategic partners and governments to build resilient, low-carbon energy systems of the future.”",https://elcogen.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/elcogen-aerial-tarto-andres.jpg,N,,2025-09-17 18:06:11.191459

Last month, CCLers mobilized en masse to contact their members of Congress ahead of the appropriations process. Together, we sent 12,859 emails to lawmakers encouraging them to fund key climate and clean energy programs.

Every year, Congress decides which programs and agencies to fund, and what level to fund them at. This is referred to as the appropriations process.

CCL hasn’t weighed in on this process before, but we felt this is an important avenue to urge Congress to reassert their authority. This action helped preserve our pathway to success, which we’ve identified is through work with Congress. Additionally, the Trump administration’s fiscal year 2026 (FY26) budget is seeking dramatic cuts to climate and clean energy programs, and we felt our voices could make a valuable impact.

The process is ongoing, but early signs from Congress are promising. On September 4, the House passed an energy and water appropriations bill. There’s no good way to sugarcoat it: This bill definitely included some harmful cuts to climate and clean energy programs, but the cuts are much less significant than those outlined in the President’s version of the budget.

During the debate on the bill, Republican members of Congress, including the chairman of the Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies Subcommittee, Rep. Chuck Fleischmann (R-TN), pushed back on completely gutting those programs. Publicly, he stated these programs are bipartisan and have his support.

Springing into Action

Congress passes appropriations bills each year to fund government operations, usually by the September 30 deadline (the start of the federal fiscal year).

We told Congress to support robust funding for programs at NOAA, NASA, and the Department of Energy that will help preserve critical science and research, strengthen clean energy infrastructure, and ensure that America’s grid can meet rising demand.

We asked our representatives to reject proposed cuts to these agencies:

National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)

NASA’s Earth-orbiting satellites and new technologies have helped scientists collect many different types of information about our planet and its climate. But the White House requested to slash NASA’s science funding by 47%.

National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)

NOAA plays a critical role in weather forecasting, extreme weather warnings, and climate science. The agency’s research is also the gold standard for tracking the levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and oceans, publishing that data publicly for America and the international community, and modeling/forecasting changes as a result. Yet the Trump administration’s proposed 2026 budget sought $2.2 billion cuts in NOAA research endeavors, grant programs and other initiatives, including dissolving the Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research.

Department of Energy (DOE)

The Department of Energy’s Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) and Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA-E) are essential for energy innovation and reliability. EERE funds early-stage research and development activities to develop efficient energy and different types of energy sources, which is critical for America’s global energy leadership. Yet the White House had proposed cutting this office’s budget by 74%.

ARPA-E develops cutting edge energy technologies that keep us ahead of global competitors while driving down costs. It’s extremely bipartisan and well-supported in Congress; yet the White House’s budget proposes a 57% cut to this agency.

We Lobbied on This, Too!

If this all sounds familiar to you, it’s because we lobbied on this issue in July, too! During our 402 meetings on Capitol Hill, we asked Congress to support the clean energy transition for affordable and reliable power as well as a safer climate.

As a tactic to achieve this ask, we requested Congress support targeted programs that enable clean energy to compete, scale, and deliver dependable and affordable power to Americans. Specifically, we mentioned the DOE programs EERE and ARPA-A as two key programs to lower energy costs through innovation and clean energy investment.

Our mobilization built on this ask by generating 12,859 messages to Congress between August 13 and September 6.

The Results So Far

The appropriations process is a long one, but it’s a key focus for Congress right now. Appropriations are mostly negotiated behind the scenes, but we’re starting to see some results. The House passed its energy and water appropriations bill early in September, which significantly reduced cuts to Department of Energy programs we lobbied and mobilized around protecting. During the debate, Republican members of the committee, including the committee chair, Rep. Chuck Fleischmann (R-TN) pushed back on additional major cuts to the DOE programs.

While this specific bill will not necessarily be what’s ultimately signed into law (the Senate and House still have to negotiate and agree), we’ve already made a difference. Thanks to everyone who sent one of our 12,859 contacts to Congress. Remember, it’s timely actions like these that create a major impact in our country’s climate policies.",https://citizensclimatelobby.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/August-action.jpg,N,,2025-09-17 14:01:57.416468

This investment, part of a $1.2 billion conditional loan, supports the construction of a lithium-ion battery separator manufacturing facility in Terre Haute, IndianaDOE Approves Loan Disbursement to ENTEK Supporting American Manufacturing and Securing Energy Supply Chains[ 1 ]. By focusing on a critical yet often overlooked component of battery technology, the project aligns with the Biden-Harris Administration's broader goals of onshoring clean energy manufacturing, reducing reliance on foreign supply chains, and accelerating the transition to electric vehicles (EVs).

Critical Minerals and the EV Supply Chain: A Strategic Bottleneck

Lithium-ion battery separators—thin, porous membranes that prevent short circuits while enabling ion flow—are a linchpin in battery performance and safety. Despite their importance, the U.S. has historically relied on foreign suppliers, particularly China, for separator production. Entek's project addresses this vulnerability by establishing the first U.S.-owned “wet-process” separator manufacturing facilityDOE Approves Loan Disbursement to ENTEK Supporting American Manufacturing and Securing Energy Supply Chains[ 1 ]. This technology, which involves coating a polymer base with ceramic materials to enhance thermal stability, is critical for high-performance EV batteries.

According to a report by the DOE's Loan Programs Office (LPO), the facility will produce 1.72 billion square meters of separator material annually, sufficient to support 1.9 million mid-size EVs or 1.3 million eSUVsLPO Announces Conditional Commitment to ENTEK Lithium Separators to Build Indiana EV Battery Separator Manufacturing Plant[ 2 ]. This capacity directly addresses the projected surge in EV demand, which the International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates will require a tenfold increase in battery production by 2030LPO Announces Conditional Commitment to ENTEK Lithium Separators to Build Indiana EV Battery Separator Manufacturing Plant[ 2 ]. By securing domestic separator production, the U.S. reduces its exposure to geopolitical risks and supply chain disruptions, particularly in light of China's dominance in global separator manufacturing (over 80% of capacity as of 2023)LPO Announces Conditional Commitment to ENTEK Lithium Separators to Build Indiana EV Battery Separator Manufacturing Plant[ 2 ].

Energy Security and the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) Synergy

The investment also aligns with the IRA's incentives for clean vehicle production, including the 30D Clean Vehicle Credit and 45X production tax creditsLPO Announces Conditional Commitment to ENTEK Lithium Separators to Build Indiana EV Battery Separator Manufacturing Plant[ 2 ]. Entek's separators will enable battery manufacturers to meet IRA content requirements, which mandate increasing U.S. sourcing of critical minerals and components over time. For instance, the 45X credit offers up to $40 per kilowatt-hour for batteries containing a growing percentage of domestically sourced materialsLPO Announces Conditional Commitment to ENTEK Lithium Separators to Build Indiana EV Battery Separator Manufacturing Plant[ 2 ]. By producing separators locally, Entek helps battery makers qualify for these credits, creating a virtuous cycle of domestic value creation.

Furthermore, the project supports the administration's “whole-of-government” approach to energy security. As stated by the LPO, the loan reinforces efforts to “build a clean energy future” while creating 763 construction jobs and 635 operational jobsLPO Announces Conditional Commitment to ENTEK Lithium Separators to Build Indiana EV Battery Separator Manufacturing Plant[ 2 ]. Notably, Entek's hiring strategy prioritizes partnerships with local institutions like Ivy Tech Community College and Indiana State University, ensuring workforce development aligns with regional economic needsDOE Approves Loan Disbursement to ENTEK Supporting American Manufacturing and Securing Energy Supply Chains[ 1 ].

Broader Implications for U.S. Competitiveness

The strategic value of this investment extends beyond EVs. Lithium-ion batteries are also essential for grid-scale energy storage, a sector projected to grow 15-fold by 2040LPO Announces Conditional Commitment to ENTEK Lithium Separators to Build Indiana EV Battery Separator Manufacturing Plant[ 2 ]. By securing a domestic supply of high-quality separators, the U.S. positions itself to lead in both transportation and energy storage markets. This is particularly critical as global competitors, including China and the European Union, aggressively subsidize their battery industries.

Conclusion: A Model for Resilient Supply Chains

The DOE's investment in Entek underscores a paradigm shift in U.S. energy policy—one that prioritizes strategic self-reliance over cost efficiency. By targeting a bottleneck in the EV supply chain and leveraging public-private partnerships, the project exemplifies how targeted interventions can catalyze broader industry transformation.

A decade ago, someone in the market for a new car with less than $25,000 to spend, had 43 different models to choose from. Today, there are five, according to Cox Automotive. None is electric.

But stalwarts like Ford Motor Co. and startups like Slate Auto are looking to change that, and they’re focusing on Americans’ favorite vehicle: the pickup.

With President Donald Trump’s tax bill killing EV incentives at the end of the month, the push for a sub-$30,000 vehicle that runs on electrons may help buttress the projected dip in sales.

Options Creep

The average price of a new car in the U.S. now hovers at $49,100, nearly a third higher than it was in the summer of 2019. The average EV price is higher still, clocking in at $8,000 above that of the industry at-large, according to Cox Automotive.

Much of the recent auto inflation can be tied directly to options and add-ons. During the peak of the pandemic-related supply chain crunch, auto executives had trouble getting enough parts, so they put what little they could find into more expensive, lavish vehicles. In many ways, they never looked back.

Last year, the average car sold for one-third more than the average starting price. Most buyers either didn’t want bare-bones base models, or couldn’t find them.

But some EV makers see a change ahead. At Slate’s launch event, CEO Chris Barman delivered what has since become a bit of a stump speech for cheap EVs. “The definition of what’s affordable is broken,” she said.

A Blank Slate

Every year, AutoPacific, an industry consultancy, asks car shoppers what features they need. For those looking to spend under $35,000, the list is short. Generally, budget-conscious drivers are willing to splurge for safety features and apathetic when it comes to leather seats, head-up displays and advanced driver-assistance systems.

Slate plans to deliver its truck late next year. (Slate Auto/dpa/TNS)

None of this is lost on Slate. The company’s truck, which it plans to deliver late next year, is to a Ford F-150 what an Ikea futon is to a Pottery Barn sectional. The base version — the company calls it “the blank Slate” — is best described by what it isn’t. It lacks a touchscreen, ambient lighting, cooled seats, air conditioning, all-wheel drive, a stereo and virtually any kind of driver-assistance.

“You could say we took out everything that wasn’t a car,” Barman said at the launch event.

What Slate promises in return is a sticker price in the mid-$20,000s, before any incentives. By Slate’s reckoning, the market is sizable. In America, we love our trucks, but only about one-third of U.S. truck owners tow regularly. We love our road trips, but on average only drive about 30 miles a day.

While roughly 163,000 Americans buy small pickups in a typical year, the potential market for Slate’s EV expands when considering the 4.3 million people who buy a small SUV or the 1.2 million or so who drive off in a compact or subcompact car.

Would-be buyers can also purchase add-ons a la carte including speakers, a spare tire, or a kit that converts the truck to an SUV. Buyers can also add accessories in the years after their initial purchase, creating what the company hopes will be a long-tail revenue source.

Detroit Reacts

Still, AutoPacific Chief Analyst Ed Kim sees Slate challenged on two fronts. Those considering the startup’s entry-level configuration may instead spring for a used truck that will offer far more features and niceties for the same price. And those considering a higher-end Slate may instead spend their money on a new machine from an established carmaker — say, the Ford Maverick, a pickup that starts around $27,000.

In fact, Ford, which dominates the market for full-size pickups, announced plans in August to make a midsize electric truck that will sell for about $30,000, as well as a battery-powered SUV that will start below $40,000.

Ford CEO Jim Farley said the company was making a “tremendous pivot” to more affordable EVs. “This is a Model T moment for the company,” he told analysts, invoking a car whose price point put Ford on the map and made automobiles ubiquitous in America.

Toyota's Tacoma has long outsold every midsize pickup on the market. (Toyota)

Toyota Motor Corp., whose Tacoma has long outsold every midsize pickup on the market, is eyeing the tiny-truck market as well. The current Tacoma starts just shy of $32,000; if the company rolls out a smaller rig for less money, it will add yet another option for budget-conscious buyers.

Most Americans say they’re EV inclined. While battery-powered cars comprise only about one in 10 new cars sales, almost 60% of shoppers say they are “very” or “somewhat” likely to buy an electric vehicle, according to JD Power.

Price is one of the obstacles, a speed bump the Trump administration made bigger when the president signed a tax law that will eliminate federal incentives for battery-powered cars and trucks. Without up to $7,500 purchase tax credits, EVs are expected to be just 27% of the market in 2030, down from nearly half had the incentives stayed in place, according to BloombergNEF’s projections.

Still, BNEF expects electric cars to be as cheap or cheaper than gas versions by around 2028. Even if they won’t help bridge the expected EV sales gap, cheaper models from Slate and Ford could help spur adoption after federal incentives disappear.

Using standardized data center designs and prefabricated components could further accelerate construction timelines and get data centers up and running years faster than previous generations of data centers built in traditional hubs like Northern Virginia or Silicon Valley.
Data center developers already recognize the advantages of this coordinated approach.
This is a challenge even for the largest AI developers.
As a result, Stargate has quietly scaled back its 2025 ambitions to building a single data center -- in Ohio.","Artificial intelligence is booming -- and America's power grid is struggling to keep up.

At the World Economic Forum, President Trump recently warned that ""We need double the energy we currently have in the United States for AI to be as big as we want to have it."" Elon Musk has echoed similar concerns, predicting that AI data centers could overwhelm the electricity supply next year. The Department of Energy predicts that AI-driven electricity demand could increase sixfold by 2030.

They're right about the scale of AI's electricity needs. But they're wrong about the diagnosis.

America doesn't suffer from a lack of energy resources. We have vast oil and gas reserves, plus growing solar and wind energy capacity. The real problem is getting the electricity that's already, or soon could be, generated from these energy sources to the data centers where it's needed.

Solving this coordination challenge will require a new approach to energy infrastructure -- one with an eye toward future needs.

This distinction between coordination and total capacity matters. If the problem were simply about generating more electricity overall, the solution would be straightforward: build more power plants and transmission lines to bring power to all the new data centers. But that would -- and will -- take years, if not decades. New transmission lines alone often take years to complete.

Instead, we need to build new data centers next to existing energy deposits -- such as natural gas fields in places like West Texas, Oklahoma, North Dakota, and elsewhere -- so that power-hungry data centers can build on-site generating plants and obtain the electricity they need, without having to connect to the broader grid. Using standardized data center designs and prefabricated components could further accelerate construction timelines and get data centers up and running years faster than previous generations of data centers built in traditional hubs like Northern Virginia or Silicon Valley.

Data center developers already recognize the advantages of this coordinated approach. A recent KPMG survey revealed that 77% of data center stakeholders consider it key to build alongside energy generation.

But in practice, data center developers often struggle to understand and vet energy producers. And in turn, those producers often misunderstand the needs of data center operators.

This is a challenge even for the largest AI developers. The Stargate project, a $500 billion AI data center investment backed by OpenAI and SoftBank, chose Abilene, Texas, as its flagship site after fielding interest from sixteen different states -- largely for Abilene's energy availability, alongside other land and regulatory advantages. Despite the initial fanfare, practical challenges quickly tempered aspirations, and the initiative has mostly stalled. As a result, Stargate has quietly scaled back its 2025 ambitions to building a single data center -- in Ohio.

To lead in the AI age, America will need more than chips and capital. It needs clearer rules, faster transactions between energy producers and AI developers, and a system that rewards coordination just as much as production.

If we solve this coordination challenge, America can lead the AI revolution and improve everything from health care to education to national security. But if we fail, we'll be left with plenty of power -- just not where it matters.",https://assets.realclear.com/images/69/697262_6_.jpeg,N,,2025-09-17 14:02:20.396840

“Increased electricity generation from natural gas, which releases about half as many CO2 emissions per unit of energy when combusted as coal, and from non-CO2-emitting wind and solar generation offset the decrease in coal generation,” EIA said.
Emissions fell the least in Idaho, where they dropped by 3%, and Mississippi, where they dropped by 1%.

EPA must go through the regulatory process to change the definition of “begin actual construction” in permitting new or updated sources of air pollution.

EPA said the move “provides flexibility to begin certain building activities that are not related to air emissions, such as installing cement pads, before obtaining a Clean Air Act construction permit.”

The Clean Air Act was first enacted in 1955 and got major updates in the 1970s. It aims to protect human health and the environment from emissions that pollute the air.

EPA must go through the regulatory process to change the definition of “begin actual construction” in permitting new or updated sources of air pollution. Officials hope to finalize a rule in 2026.

Zeldin joined President Donald Trump at the Energy and Innovation Summit at Carnegie Mellon University in July. The event, organized by Sen. Dave McCormick (R-Pa.), sought to position Pennsylvania as a leader in AI and the energy needed to power it, with an emphasis on natural gas.

Following the event, Zeldin wrote in an op-ed that permit reform “is a core pillar of my Powering the Great American Comeback initiative.”

While the details of the proposal are not yet released, the move signals an attempted rollback of Clean Air Act protections, said Angela Kilbert, senior attorney with PennFuture.

“Allowing for a broader amount of pre-construction before air permitting exists, runs the risk of a source becoming a foregone conclusion,” Kilbert said. “It will undermine the ability of the agency to actually review what the source intends to be and do, and it also undermines what the public is able to comment on.”

Alex Bomstein, executive director of Clean Air Council, said companies can exert more pressure on regulators if they can start building, and investing, before getting all their permits.

“A lot of permitting is political. It shouldn't be, but it is,” Bomstein said.

He said the Clean Air Act is estimated to have created trillions of dollars in benefits for Americans’ health and welfare.

Electric vehicle demand is still rising in the United States, but growth has slowed amidst stalling EV charger expansion, per the conclusions of theHERE–SBD EV Indexpublished Sept. 4 by global mapping company Here Technologies and automotive research firm SBD Automotive.

According to the report, the U.S. added 37,000 EV charging points to its overall network between June 2024 and June 2025 — a 19% increase that translates to a 52% increase in total charge power. However, the expansion between 2023 and 2024 was much bigger, with a 32% increase in charging points and 82% boost in total charge power.

The index authors combined market data, including Here Technologies’ EV charge point information, with the results of an SBD survey of drivers, including 1,000 in the U.S. to analyze EV transition progress and obstacles.

Per the survey, 53% of U.S. respondents pointed to a “perception” of the lack of charging access as the top barrier to EV adoption. In addition, 57% of U.S. respondents said they were likely to buy a traditional gasoline-powered car for their next vehicle.

The findings “make clear that current efforts are not sufficient to meet most regional electrification ambitions, underscoring the need for stronger policies and more proactive product strategies,” Robert Fisher, electrification and sustainability principal at SBD Automotive, said in a statement.

Policy changes have created obstacles in the U.S. EV transition, including the Trump administration’s six-month freeze of the federal EV charging expansion program (since reversed), the uneven deployment of the federal program at the state level and the impending expiration of EV tax credits, the report noted.

Still, EV owners are satisfied with their vehicles, the survey found, with only 5% of current EV drivers in the U.S. saying they would switch away from electric. Plus, many states are steadily improving their EV charger landscapes, as evidenced by the index’s state EV infrastructure and uptake ratings. States were ranked based on the number of public chargers per road length (how far one must drive for a charger), the average capacity of public chargers (how fast one can charge), the ratio of public chargers to EVs (the likelihood of finding an open charger) and the share of EVs on the road.

Delaware was ranked the top state for the second year in a row even though it saw declines in its ratio of public chargers to EVs and the average charging power of public stations.

Washington, D.C., New Jersey, New York and Massachusetts rounded out the top five, while Nebraska, Minnesota, Arkansas, Idaho and Alaska ranked in the bottom five.

The EV tax credit was never meant to last forever. But now it ends years before it was supposed to. What happens to the American EV market after that is anyone's guess. Predictions about the level of EV investments and planned new electric models are all over the map, and we will all see just how much this current moment was propped up by U.S. policy support.

30%: EV Registrations In July Show Big Gains For Some, But Not All

The sales numbers reported by the car companies are one data point we use to track who's up and who's down. But arguably a more useful metric is actual registration data from each state, and that can take a while to tally up.

S&P Global Mobility has the EV registration numbers for July, and understandably, people are rushing to get a good deal while they can. As Automotive News reports, here are some of the winners and losers from that month:

Tesla missed out on the July surge, with its five models losing ground compared with a year earlier for a 13 percent overall decline, the data showed. Newcomers Rivian and VinFast also saw registrations slip while Lucid posted a small gain.

The Model Y’s nearest direct competitor in July was the Chevrolet Equinox EV with 8,447 registrations, a nearly four-times gain versus a year earlier, S&P Global Mobility said. As a brand, Chevrolet’s registrations doubled to 11,655.

Volkswagen’s ID. 4 compact crossover also surged in July, with registrations of 3,974 vehicles, a 93 percent gain compared with the year-earlier month, the data showed. Across the brand, EV registrations jumped 127 percent to 4,669 vehicles.

In the luxury segment, Cadillac’s EV registrations rose 76 percent in July to 4,687 vehicles and Audi’s more than tripled to 4,406, the data showed. BMW slid 37 percent to 3,432 and Mercedes-Benz fell 29 percent to 1,955 vehicles.

Evidently, brand baggage at Tesla—if we want to give it a charitable name—is dragging things down, and even the updated Model Y can't save things. The other issue may be Tesla's increasing lack of options in various segments, like cheaper small crossovers or large, three-row SUVs.

For now, the biggest winners seem to be General Motors' family of brands, Hyundai, Ford and Honda. But there's one other notable tidbit here about that last automaker:

Honda’s only fully electric model, the Prologue crossover, carried average incentives of $12,946 per vehicle in July, according to Motor Intelligence. A year earlier, the incentives averaged $7,036 per vehicle.

I have two takeaways here: one, if you're looking for a great EV deal before Sept. 30, you can probably get a Honda Prologue for a steal. And two, considering how much money Honda must be losing with all those incentives, don't expect Prologue deals to last forever.

In fact, probably don't expect most of these deals to last forever. Here's our list of September EV deals. Godspeed and good luck if you're car-hunting this week and next.

60%: Tesla Settles Two Autopilot-Related Fatal Crash Lawsuits

Tesla Model Y Juniper Autopilot Screen

""We will never surrender/settle an unjust case against us, even if we will probably lose,"" Tesla CEO Elon Musk boasted in 2022. (There's always a tweet.) As tough as that sounds, Tesla is hanging its entire future on autonomous driving technology and robotics, and a recent $243 million civil judgment over an Autopilot-related fatal crash in Florida isn't the kind of headache it needs right now.

That may be why, as Reuters reported today, Tesla is settling two separate California crashes in 2019 involving Autopilot:

The electric-vehicle maker, which has settled several other cases involving its vehicles and self-driving technology, had rejected a $60 million settlement proposal for the Florida lawsuit, a filing showed last month.

The Florida verdict and the two settlements in California are significant as much of Tesla's $1.4 trillion valuation hangs on CEO Elon Musk's promise to rapidly expand its robotaxis and the full self-driving (FSD) software that underpins them. FSD is an advanced version of Autopilot.

One lawsuit, the settlement notice for which was filed on Tuesday, relates to the death of a 15-year-old boy who was traveling in Alameda County, California, with his father in a vehicle when it was rear-ended by a Tesla Model 3, which had Autopilot engaged, causing the victim's vehicle to roll over and crash into the center barrier. The boy succumbed to his injuries from the collision.

The other case relates to the death in December 2019 of two people who were traveling through an intersection in Gardena, California, in a Honda Civic when a Tesla Model S, equipped with Autopilot, failed to stop at a red light at high speed and crashed into the victims' vehicle.

Neither party disclosed the terms of those settlements, but after the Florida verdict, one can assume they were cheaper than dragging this into a trial.

Tesla is eager to roll out more Full Self-Driving-equipped Robotaxis in various cities. But critics say it has a long way to go to prove the camera-based technology's viability, and that the string of Autopilot- and FSD-related crashes and deaths should raise questions about its overall safety.

90%: Rivian Bucks An 'EV Slowdown' As Georgia Factory Breaks Ground

Rivian R2

Rivian started life in a former Mitsubishi plant in Normal, Ill. But that plant isn't terribly suited to its long-term needs, particularly ramping up the $45,000 Rivian R2 and the other EVs that will use its platform. Hence, a new factory east of Atlanta to make those cars and hopefully cement the automaker's future.

The Rivian Georgia plant broke ground on Tuesday and the Wall Street Journal has the story on why both the automaker and state officials are optimistic about its prospects long-term, even without any EV tax credits to help with sales:

[CEO RJ Scaringe] said that there has been an overemphasis on the recent policy changes.

“I didn’t start this company and plan to scale the business because of that credit,” Scaringe said. “So that goes away, we’re still deeply convicted on the products, deeply convicted on the technology we’re building.”

The plant represents the latest addition to the growing automotive-manufacturing presence in Georgia.

Gov. Brian Kemp, a Republican, also attended the ceremony on Tuesday, saying the project will be an economic boon to the local area.

“This project stretches back many years, and leaders have worked to secure a transformational project like this that will literally have generational benefits,” he told attendees.

Georgia, of course, has had some painful moments with its big EV industrial push. The Hyundai Metaplant outside Savannah was the site of a massive immigration raid that's complicating relations with South Korea and delaying production at its associated battery plant. That plant, too, could soon produce EVs that are less enticing without the tax credit, and the same may end up being true of the R2.

100%: How Do Automakers Sell EVs In The Post-Tax Credit Era?

2024 Honda Prologue Elite

I don't have a crystal ball that tells me exactly what will happen to America's EV market without the tax credits or, perhaps more crucially, any emissions rules that were driving a more electric market. But I am confident that the participation-trophy era of EVs is over, and these cars will have to succeed on their own merits and not be afterthoughts that were only created because they had to be.

That's also going to mean changes to how automakers market these cars and work with dealers to sell them. ""I got a great deal"" won't cut it anymore. And for an industry that really only knows how to sell gas cars, this is going to be a challenge.

In unleashing his war on solar and wind, Trump is directly opposing the will of the American people.","Trump’s policy attacks on solar and wind is stupid and dangerous — to our wallets, American industry, our health, or our climate.

On Inauguration Day 2025, Trump declared a “national energy emergency.” What he really declared was a war on renewable energy. And this war is already doing incredible harm to our health, our environment, and our wallets.

Renewable energy technologies like solar, wind, and the battery storage that supports them have been in Trump’s crosshairs since his first stint in the White House. Now, he’s wielding even more reckless and destructive policy tools to attack clean energy.

This comes as no surprise, given the campaign promises he’s made to the industry and the outpouring of cash it lavished on his re-election bid. Trump’s attacks on renewables work hand-in-hand with his pro-fossil policies — like opening up federal land to drilling and fast-tracking fossil fuel projects — for the benefit of his Big Oil buddies.

This couldn’t come at a worse time. While climate-fueled disasters ravage our country, Trump is striking down the renewables we need. Nothing less than a 100% transition to renewable energy will cut it if we are to avert climate catastrophe and save millions of lives.

Trump’s nonsensical attacks on clean, affordable renewables are dangerous. His actions are putting energy access and affordability, jobs, local economies, and our very lives at risk. Here’s what he’s doing, what’s at stake, and how we fight back.

Trump’s Battle Plans Against Wind and Solar

Since literally Day One, Trump has gone after wind and solar with far-reaching (and even illegal) action. That includes:

All but guaranteeing an end to federal support for renewable energy. Trump’s Big Ugly Bill clawed back tax credits for renewables and related manufacturing, threatening billions of dollars’ worth of renewable energy projects. The Trump administration then passed new rules to make it even harder for solar and wind projects to claim federal tax credits, hamstringing our energy transition. These new rules put unattainable requirements on clean energy projects, which will lead many to shutter. Meanwhile, the big Ugly Bill preserved and in some cases expanded benefits for fossil fuels.

Stopping wind projects. Trump has declared that the U.S. will see “no new windmills” on his watch and that his administration will stop approvals of solar and wind. He’s halted major offshore wind projects and frozen permitting and leasing for wind projects on federal lands and waters. In late August, he canceled $679 million in funding for offshore wind.

Freezing and rolling back funds already signed into law by Congress. This includes funds from the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, which set aside $27 billion for clean energy and climate resilience projects.

Taking away cost-saving solar projects from low-income families. Trump has moved to eliminate $7 billion in grants for the Solar for All Program, which would have helped more than 900,000 households gain access to solar energy by funding rooftop or community solar. The program was estimated to save these families more than $350 million a year on power bills.

Curtailing support for farmers to build solar. Trump’s U.S. Department of Agriculture announced new changes to stop farmers from accessing the Rural Energy for America Program. This program has helped thousands of farmers install solar panels to lower energy bills and earn additional income.

Trump’s War Will Raise Energy Costs

Transitioning to renewables isn’t just good for our climate and our futures, though that’s pretty compelling on its own. It’s also good for our wallets.

Solar and wind are the fastest, cheapest way to add new power to the grid. They’re now some of the cheapest forms of energy, period, even without subsidies.

Cutting support for renewables will result in companies turning to slower, dirtier, more expensive fossil fuels. Utilities will pass these costs onto customers in the form of higher bills.

While campaigning for his second term, Trump proclaimed that, “As President, I will set a national goal of ensuring that America has the No. 1 lowest cost of energy of any industrial country anywhere on Earth.” If he’s set that goal, he’s certainly failing.

Right now, electricity prices are surging at twice the rate of inflation. Trump has baselessly blamed that on renewables. But in fact, the states with the most renewables have seen lower price hikes or declines, according to Heatmap News.

Meanwhile, Trump’s policies will have a direct hand in making power more expensive. By one analysis, Trump’s Big Ugly Bill alone will have families paying $280 more a year on energy costs by 2035. On top of that, we’ll face greater healthcare costs from staying on polluting fossil fuels and the economic toll of climate change.

People in the U.S. are footing the bill for everything from hospital visits to storm recovery because we’re still stuck on fossil fuels. Rather than support renewables, Trump is stomping them down for the sake of his friends in the fossil fuel industry.

Trump’s War on Renewables is Senseless and Cruel

The Inflation Reduction Act spurred a manufacturing renaissance through its incentives for clean energy. The vast majority of resulting investments and benefits — including thousands of jobs — have gone to red states. Yet every Republican lawmaker voted to gut Inflation Reduction Act incentives through Trump’s Big Ugly Bill.

The impacts will be devastating for local industry and economies. The clean energy industry already began pulling back on new projects before the bill passed, in anticipation of big cuts. Since Trump took office, almost $28 billion-worth of clean energy projects have been cancelled or delayed.

By one analysis, during Trump’s first six months in office, companies have paused, cancelled, or shuttered solar, wind, EV, and battery projects totalling 19,000 jobs chopped.

Renewables aren’t just a no-brainer for our health and climate. They’re a no-brainer for the economy. They’ll bring more jobs, investment at the state and local level, and cheaper power for families. But rather than usher them in with incentives that level the playing field against ludicrously subsidized fossil fuels, Trump is pulling us backward.

To be clear, the solution isn’t so-called “permitting reform” to hasten energy projects, as some Democrats are discussing with Republicans. As Trump’s attacks on wind and solar show, this will only benefit the fossil fuel industry.

Such attacks are unimaginable at this critical juncture of the climate crisis, when we’re already seeing horrific climate-fueled disasters from coast to coast.

The people of this country know that renewables are the future. The vast majority support more solar power. Sixty percent say that expanding wind and solar is more important than expanding fossil fuels. In unleashing his war on solar and wind, Trump is directly opposing the will of the American people.

Fighting Back Against Trump’s War at the State Level

It’s clear that Trump is hell-bent on destroying federal investment in our livable future. While we continue to fight the worst of Trump’s policies from the streets to the Courts, we also know that’s not the only way to defend our planet.

State action is more important than ever. States have a huge opportunity — and obligation to current and future generations — to pick up the slack and pass bold climate action.

They can pass incentives for real renewables and remove boondoggles from incentive programs. That’s what we’re fighting for in California, to ensure the state’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard stops incentivizing polluting factory farms.

They can stop subsidies for dirty energy, one of which we already defeated in New York. After a long campaign with allies, we pushed the state assembly to stop forcing energy customers to subsidize new gas hookups.

And they can replace fossil fuels with renewables. In the Sunshine State, many Florida utilities are nevertheless clinging to fracked gas and planning to build out fracked gas infrastructure. There, we’re fighting utilities’ greedy price hikes and demanding a fossil-free future for Floridians.

The science is clear: a complete transition to renewables is essential for our climate, our health, and our wallets. While Trump wages his senseless attacks, we’ll continue to fight at the local, state, and national level for the 100% renewable future we need. We can’t afford anything less.",https://www.foodandwaterwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/evergreen_header_climate_pollution_9b.jpg,N,,2025-09-17 12:04:49.978667

Rivian has begun construction on its $5 billion Georgia plant even though the Trump administration ended the $7,500 federal tax credit for EV buyers.

The Georgia facility, with a planned annual capacity of 200,000 vehicles, is key to Rivian achieving the scale necessary to profitably produce lower-priced R2 and future R3 models.

Rivian faces slowing U.S. EV sales, rising competition from established automakers, tariffs, and local opposition, making successful execution at the Georgia plant crucial to the company’s survival and growth.

Rivian has broken ground on its long-delayed $5 billion electric vehicle plant east of Atlanta, Georgia, even as President Donald Trump’s rollback of EV tax credits takes effect later this month.

According to the EV maker’s CEO, Rj Scaringe, the R2 SUV will succeed on its own merits, describing it as “an incredible five-passenger off-road machine” that just happens to be electric.

The Georgia plant, first announced in 2021, is central to Rivian’s strategy to achieve profitability. The facility is expected to produce 200,000 units. Currently, Rivian manufactures R1T pickup trucks, R1S SUVs, and delivery vans for Amazon at its Normal, Illinois, plant.

The Illinois facility will begin producing the smaller R2 model next year, with prices starting at $45,000. The expansion will enable the assembly of 215,000 vehicles per year. This comes as Rivian expects to deliver 40,000 to 46,000 vehicles this year, down from 52,000 in 2024, in part to prepare for 2026 model launches.

Although EV sales growth is slow, increasing by just 1.5% in the first half of 2025, according to Cox Automotive, Tesla remains in the lead with almost 45% of U.S. EV sales. Rivian, with a 3% share, is the most successful startup automaker, but it’s facing increasing competition from Ford’s F-150 Lightning, Chevrolet Silverado EV, and other established automakers.

Additionally, Georgia is providing $1.5 billion in incentives for 7,500 jobs averaging $56,000 annually, with most incentives contingent on employment targets. The state has already invested $175 million in land preparation and infrastructure. Governor Brian Kemp has prioritized making Georgia a hub for electric mobility.

However, the company faces additional challenges, including $2,000 tariffs per vehicle, lost revenue from the end of EV tax credits, long-term competition from low-cost Chinese EVs, and local opposition citing environmental concerns. Delays in construction during 2024, along with cash constraints, also hindered progress.

Moreover, Rivian had previously received a $6.6 billion federal loan and a $5.8 billion investment from Volkswagen to support the development of its Georgia plant and technology.

From Automotive News: EV registrations from all brands grew 6 percent in July to 124,961, S&P Global Mobility said.
From January to July, EV registrations grew 6.8 percent to 745,616 vehicles.
Aside from a race against the clock to buy an EV before the tax credit expires, incentives are driving EV sales, according to Auto News.","Good morning! It's Wednesday, September 17, 2025, and this is The Morning Shift, your daily roundup of the top automotive headlines from around the world, in one place. This is where you'll find the most important stories that are shaping the way Americans drive and get around.

In this morning's edition, EV registrations take a big jump ahead of the death of the $7,500 vehicle tax credit, Rivian finally breaks ground on its Georgia plant, Nissan is shuttering design studios in the U.S. and Brazil, among other cost-cutting efforts, and GM is idling its midsize truck plant for three weeks because of a parts shortage.

EV buyers are doing everything they can to take advantage of the $7,500 tax credit before it expires on September 30, thanks to President Donald Trump and the Republican-led Congress. That means new EV registrations at legacy automakers were up 27% in July, according to S&P Global Mobility.

In a not-entirely shocking development, Tesla missed out on July's surge. Of course, it still led the way when it came to overall sales, but its five models lost ground compared to a year earlier. The Austin, Texas-based company's registrations were down 13% overall. Rivian and VinFast also saw slips, while Lucid saw a small gain.

The top five were as follows: Tesla (49,774), Chevy (11,655), Hyundai (7,898), Ford (7,572) and Honda (6,089). From Automotive News:

EV registrations from all brands grew 6 percent in July to 124,961, S&P Global Mobility said. EV share of the light-vehicle market rose to 8.9 percent from 8.5 percent in July 2024.

From January to July, EV registrations grew 6.8 percent to 745,616 vehicles. Their share of the light-vehicle market rose 0.1 percentage point to 7.7 percent, the data showed.

Cox Automotive said third-quarter sales of new electric vehicles should hit an all-time record. It estimated August EV deliveries at 146,332 for a nearly 10 percent market share.

Aside from a race against the clock to buy an EV before the tax credit expires, incentives are driving EV sales, according to Auto News. Many of the most popular EVs on sale right now, like the Tesla Model Y and Honda Prologue, carry massive amounts of cash on the hood to help them get off showroom floors. It's tough to say how long those will last — especially after September 30 and especially as automakers continue to refocus on hybrids.

If you want my advice, I think that if you really want an EV in your driveway, you'd better get going, because this might be your last chance to get any sort of deal for a good long while.

It has been a long time coming, but Rivian has finally broken ground on its Georgia factory near Atlanta that is supposed to build the R2, R3 and other future lower-cost vehicles using a new platform. The EV maker had done prep work at the nearly 2,000-acre site before pausing in 2024 as it shifted production plans for its next vehicles, the R2, to its factory in Illinois. From Automotive News:

Rivian revived the Georgia project after approval of a $6.6 billion loan agreement with the Department of Energy in the waning days of the Biden administration in mid-January.

The automaker has said the Stanton Springs, Ga., project is critical to transforming into a mass-market brand and gaining the scale needed for future profitability.

[...]

The automaker has said the Stanton Springs, Ga., project is critical to transforming into a mass-market brand and gaining the scale needed for future profitability.

The automaker needs to scale up as quickly as possible using the federal loan package and state incentives for its Georgia plant before they expire, said Sam Fiorani, vice president of vehicle forecasting at AutoForecast Solutions.

[...]

Rivian first announced the Georgia factory in December 2021 with production planned for 2024. When Rivian unveiled the R2 and R3 in 2024, it said it would first expand its Normal, Ill. factory for the R2 and pause Georgia to a future date.

The automaker now plans the first phase of construction to begin in 2026, followed by the start of production in 2028. Rivian will also make the R2 in Georgia, followed by the R3.

It's expected that the R2 will start around the $45,000 mark and the smaller R3 will be even less than that. Both undercut the larger R1T pickup and R1S crossover, which start well above $70,000. There are even some early rumblings of plans to make even lower-cost vehicles like an R4 and R5, but details on those cars are hazy at best.

Regardless, Rivian needs to lock in quickly. It's burning through cash like nobody's business, and while it does make a good product, that sort of thing cannot last forever.

More cuts are coming to Nissan. The Japanese automaker says it is closing design centers in California and Sao Paulo, Brazil. It is also scaling back its operations in London and Japan as part of a larger realignment of its global design organization. These changes are expected to be done by the end of the 2025 fiscal year. From Reuters:

The changes, part of its broader ""Re:Nissan"" plan, will consolidate its design organization into five hubs: Los Angeles, London, Shanghai, Tokyo and Japan's Atsugi.

Nissan said its Los Angeles ""Studio Six"" will become its primary U.S. design hub, while London will continue to support the automaker's Africa, Middle East, India, Europe and Oceania regions in collaboration with partner Renault.

The company did not disclose how many jobs would be affected.

Nissan CEO Ivan Espinosa, who took over in April, in May unveiled the ""Re:Nissan"" turnaround plan to restore profitability. It included measures such as cutting global production capacity to 2.5 million vehicles from 3.5 million and manufacturing sites to 10 from 17 by fiscal 2027.

Nissan is doing everything it can to right its sinking ship, so it makes sense that it would be making cuts like these. Let's just hope not too many jobs are impacted, though I'm sure that's going to be the case.

General Motors is idling its Wentzville Assembly mid-size truck plant in Missouri and temporarily laying off workers for three weeks because of a parts shortage. The pause is set to begin on September 29, and it'll last until October 20, impacting about 3,800 employees who build the Chevy Colorado and GMC Canyon midsize pickup trucks as well as the Chevy Express and GMC Savana vans. From the Detroit Free Press:

""We have temporarily adjusted production schedules at Wentzville Assembly to address supply chain issues and align with overall business needs,"" GM spokesman Kevin Kelly said in a statement provided on Sept. 16. ""The plant is expected to resume normal operations on Oct. 20.

Plant executive Eric Shelhorn and UAW Local 2250 chairman Jon Daughterty notified employees in a letter posted to the union's website on Sept. 12.

""Although this temporary layoff will affect the majority of our team on all three shifts, skilled trades, stamping, body shop, final process and those groups that support these departments may have work available during this time,"" the letter read.

GM wouldn't provide specifics on what part or parts were causing the shortage, and I desperately want to know what parts are shared between the relatively new Canyon/Colorado and the Express, which has been relatively unchanged for nearly 30 years.",https://www.jalopnik.com/img/gallery/ev-registrations-jump-before-trump-kills-tax-credit-at-the-end-of-the-month/l-intro-1758117488.jpg,N,,2025-09-17 13:02:56.788148

This directive opts for a roll-up-the-sleeves approach to dealing with the state's infrastructure and energy affordability. As reported by the Office of the Arizona Governor, Hobbs’ order mandates a brisk, 30-day turnaround for a report from State Land detailing how to fast-track energy projects.

Echoing the governor, this initiative is about handcrafting a more cost-effective energy future for Arizona. ""We have incredible potential to deliver affordable energy to every business and family who needs it. We just need to unleash it,"" Governor Hobbs stated. The Order aims to circumvent bureaucracy, cut down red tape, and prioritize common sense over outmoded protocols. In the process, Hobbs hopes to craft the scaffolding for the much-needed energy infrastructure.

Fleshing out the operational side, the Executive Order births the Arizona Energy Promise Taskforce. This assembly will map plans to bolster sizable growth, rein in energy expenditure for locals, and smooth out the regulatory bumps that slow down infrastructure projects. Taskforce duties also include scrutinizing how to match electric vehicle adoption with fuel affordability and touching base with energy-specific businesses affected by federal policy adjustments.

Notably, the Executive Order comes at a time when energy security hangs in a delicate balance. The repeal of green energy tax incentives and hindrances miring solar and wind project rollouts have thrown a spanner in the works of energy development and job creation. ""This Executive Order focuses on giving Arizona families the affordable and innovative energy future they want and deserve,"" mentioned Maren Mahoney, Director of the Governor’s Office of Resiliency. Meanwhile, projections indicate a possible 40% swell in peak demand across the next decade and a half.

Supporters of the move, such as NextEra Energy Resources and the Arizona Building and Construction Trades Council, laud the governor for her foresight. According to Jim Shandalov, Vice President of NextEra Energy Resources, Arizona’s initiative has made it a standard-bearer in affordable American-made energy.

At a grassroots level, organizations like Wildfire advocate for Hobbs' attention to energy affordability. ""Too many Arizonans are forced to choose between paying their energy bills and covering other essentials like food and medicine,"" said Kelly McGowan, executive director of Wildfire. Reducing energy bills is seen as critical to helping Arizonans live without having to compromise on essentials for a bill's sake.",https://img.hoodline.com/2025/9/governor-katie-hobbs-launches-bold-executive-order-to-revamp-arizona-s-energy-infrastructure-and-affordability.webp,N,,2025-09-17 12:05:39.672352
,EPA,2025-09-17 14:27:09+00:00,www.nationofchange.org,Trump EPA moves to end emissions reporting used by communities and investors,Not Available,,,,,https://www.nationofchange.org/2025/09/17/trump-epa-moves-to-end-emissions-reporting-used-by-communities-and-investors/,"The Environmental Protection Agency announced Friday a sweeping proposal to eliminate the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program, a federal data collection system that has tracked emissions from thousands of the nation’s largest polluters since 2010.
Zeldin said in a statement that “the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program is nothing more than bureaucratic red tape that does nothing to improve air quality.” He added that “Alongside President Trump, E.P.A.
Since 2010, the program has collected data from about 8,000 facilities, including coal-burning power plants, oil refineries, steel mills, and landfills.
“Cutting the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program blinds Americans to the facts about climate pollution.
The United States missed an April deadline to submit emissions data to the United Nations, a requirement under the Paris accord.","The Environmental Protection Agency announced Friday a sweeping proposal to eliminate the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program, a federal data collection system that has tracked emissions from thousands of the nation’s largest polluters since 2010. Administrator Lee Zeldin, citing President Donald Trump’s anti-climate executive actions, described the program as unnecessary bureaucracy, a characterization that has drawn widespread condemnation from environmental advocates, former agency officials, and even some industry voices.

Zeldin said in a statement that “the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program is nothing more than bureaucratic red tape that does nothing to improve air quality.” He added that “Alongside President Trump, E.P.A. continues to live up to the promise of unleashing energy dominance that powers the American dream.” The agency estimated that ending the program could save businesses up to $2.4 billion in compliance costs over the next decade.

Critics say the move would gut one of the government’s most basic climate tools. Since 2010, the program has collected data from about 8,000 facilities, including coal-burning power plants, oil refineries, steel mills, and landfills. That information has helped guide federal climate policy, shaped local health decisions, and been shared with the United Nations, which requires developed countries to submit domestic emissions tallies under the Paris climate agreement.

“President Trump promised Americans would have the cleanest air on Earth, but once again, Trump’s EPA is taking actions that move us further from that goal,” said Joseph Goffman, who led the EPA Office of Air and Radiation during the Biden administration and is now with the Environmental Protection Network. “Cutting the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program blinds Americans to the facts about climate pollution. Without it, policymakers, businesses, and communities cannot make sound decisions about how to cut emissions and protect public health.”

Goffman added, “By hiding this information from the public, Administrator Zeldin is denying Americans the ability to see the damaging results of his actions on climate pollution, air quality, and public health. It’s a further addition to the deliberate blockade against future action on climate change—and yet another example of the administration putting polluters before people’s health.”

The administration argues that the program’s elimination is about reducing costs, but environmental groups called it an attack on transparency and accountability. Patrick Drupp, the Sierra Club’s director of climate policy and advocacy, warned, “EPA cannot avoid the climate crisis by simply burying its head in the sand as it baselessly cuts off its main source of greenhouse gas emissions data.” He said, “The agency has provided no defensible reason to cancel the program; this is nothing more than EPA’s latest action to deny the reality of climate change and do everything it can to put the fossil fuel industry and corporate polluters before people. The Sierra Club will oppose this proposal every step of the way.”

Margie Alt, director of the Climate Action Campaign, described the rollback as “the Trump administration’s latest pro-polluter move to eliminate the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program” and “just another brazen step in their Polluters First agenda.” She added, “under the guise of saving Americans money, this is an attempt on the part of Trump, Lee Zeldin, and their polluter buddies to hide the ball and avoid responsibility for the deadly, dangerous, and expensive pollution they produce.”

Alt continued, “If they succeed, the nation’s biggest polluters will spew climate-wrecking pollution without accountability. The idea that tracking pollution does ‘nothing to improve air quality’ is absurd. If you don’t measure it, you can’t manage it. Hiding information and allowing fossil fuel companies to avoid accountability are the true goals of this rule.”

The BlueGreen Alliance, a coalition of labor and environmental groups, echoed these concerns. Executive director Jason Walsh said, “the Trump administration continues to prove it does not care about the American people and their basic right to breathe clean air. This flies in the face of the EPA’s core mission—to protect the environment and public health.” He noted that “The proposal is wildly unpopular with even industry groups speaking against it because they know the value of having this emissions data available.”

“Everybody in this country deserves to know the air quality in their community and how their lives can be affected when they live near high-emitting facilities,” Walsh said. “Knowledge is power and—in this case—health. The administration shouldn’t be keeping people in the dark about the air they and their neighbors are breathing.”

The announcement also reverberates internationally. The United States missed an April deadline to submit emissions data to the United Nations, a requirement under the Paris accord. Trump began the yearlong withdrawal process from the pact on his first day back in office. The proposal to end the program further erodes U.S. commitments to international climate reporting, even as Europe launches new satellites dedicated to tracking carbon pollution.

Environmental law experts underscored the practical consequences of cutting off verified data. Carrie Jenks, executive director of the environmental and energy law program at Harvard Law School, explained that methane is “roughly 80 times more effective than carbon dioxide at trapping heat in the atmosphere in the short term.” She said, “Not having the government verify this data is hard, but there could still be some voluntary efforts to collect it.”

Some industry groups also voiced concern. The American Petroleum Institute said the oil and gas industry already reports greenhouse gas emissions “to a variety of stakeholders.” Dustin Meyer, senior vice president for policy, economics, and regulatory affairs at the API, said, “the oil and gas industry has a long track record of reporting greenhouse gas emissions to a variety of stakeholders, and we remain committed to doing so in a transparent and accurate way.”

The proposal follows other Trump administration rollbacks, including a decision just one day earlier to reverse rules on unsafe levels of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, in drinking water. Earthjustice attorney Katherine O’Brien said the PFAS decision “prioritizes chemical industry profits and utility companies’ bottom line over the health of children and families across the country.”

The EPA will publish the emissions proposal in the Federal Register and open a 47-day public comment period before finalizing the rule, likely within the next year. Environmental organizations have already signaled they will challenge the rollback.

As Goffman put it, “With this move, they’re taking away the practical and material capacity of the federal government to do the basic elements of climate policy making.”",https://i0.wp.com/s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/media.nationofchange.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/26124152/EPA-New-Power-Plant-Rule.png?fit=1200%2C628&ssl=1,N,,2025-09-17 12:05:36.004438

The same issue confronts grid operators across the United States. PJM’s response stands out because its 13-state region, with 67 million customers, is the nation’s largest, and it hosts “data center alley” in northern Virginia, by far the largest U.S. concentration of the data farm installations.

The North American Electric Reliability Corp., the interstate grid’s security monitor, has a top-level planning committee developing policy proposals for managing data center challenges.

“There is already evidence that large loads impact bulk [wholesale power] system reliability,” NERC said in a committee report in July, citing grid disruptions in Virginia and Texas. NERC’s follow-up report with action proposals is scheduled for release later this year.

PJM’s policy welcomes the data center boom, joining President Donald Trump and the leadership of the power sector. PJM says it aims to enable “new large loads to connect as rapidly as possible and at the same time determine a plan for how reliability is maintained.”

The proposal would keep PJM from having to increase the system’s capacity to meet the peak demand from new data centers. But data centers that didn’t, or couldn’t, acquire enough generation to run their operations would face a risk of unpredictable power cutoffs when the PJM grid is stressed.

The proposal does not speak directly to a second critical issue stemming from the AI data center shock wave — how the plan will deal with the rapid increase in utility bills triggered by the data center’s power demands, said Tom Rutigliano, senior advocate for climate and energy at the Natural Resources Defense Council.

“Forecasts for data center growth far exceed the rate PJM can add power plants,” NRDC said in a statement Monday. The increased power demand is expected to continue inflating electricity prices now, with faster acceleration beginning in mid-July 2028, NRDC said.

NRDC stated, “PJM’s plan aims to prevent blackouts, but fails to protect consumers from ever-increasing bills. Electricity costs in the region are up $12 billion this year alone.

“Based on calculations by NRDC using PJM data, under PJM’s plan the public will pay over $20 billion every year from 2028 through at least 2032 as forecast data centers continue to drive up prices,” according to NRDC. “This adds up to a $100 billion or higher bill over this period paid by PJM residents. Virtually all of this will be windfall payments to existing power plants rather than investment in new ones.”

Rutigliano said NRDC cost figures derive from existing formulas that PJM uses to establish “capacity” payments in annual auctions. These payments to power plant operators are to incentivize enough generation to keep operating to cover expected power demands in future years. They are ultimately paid by utility customers.

NRDC’s calculation assumes that increasing data center power demand will keep capacity prices at established ceiling prices, he added.

PJM’s proposal will be open for discussion by PJM’s membership, with a final plan expected to be submitted by this December to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for approval. PJM aims to have it in effect for the capacity auction to secure power supply for the mid-2028 to mid-2029.

“To PJM credit, they’re grappling with the problem,” Rutigliano said.

“PJM’s proposal is very much a work in progress, and is expected to change,” said PJM senior communications manager Jeffrey Shields. “PJM received significant feedback from stakeholders and is willing to evolve its proposal, drop elements altogether and incorporate entirely new frameworks into its proposal that are proposed by other stakeholders.”

“If we do nothing, there is definitely a higher risk of reliability issues including power outages,” Shields added.",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/93/d0/18e2ac1f4238b96c16712d122af9/the-cloud-96920.jpg,N,,2025-09-17 12:05:13.581900

That power is then returned to the grid in the early evening when demand is still high and solar production is waning.
These records underscore solar, wind and batteries’ critical role in meeting ERCOT’s growing power demand, which has jumped 5.5% through August compared to the same period in 2024.
Through August, solar generation is up 13.8 million megawatt-hours (MWh) compared to 2024 and has supplied 13.8% of total demand year to date.
In a first, solar out-generated both coal and wind in August, making it the second-largest resource on the ERCOT grid, trailing only gas.","Solar set a new ERCOT record (last Tuesday) on Sept. 9, generating almost half of total demand in the fast-growing Texas electricity market while providing more than 40% of the state’s electricity for seven straight hours, from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m.

The latest record is the 17th of 2025, an astounding 7,785 megawatts (MW) higher than the first record of 22,092 MW set Jan. 24. New data from ERCOT—the Electric Reliability Council of Texas—also highlights solar’s reliability over the summer: For the period from June 1 through Aug. 31, solar met 15.2% of all demand in the ERCOT system, more than coal’s 12.5% market share.

It also covered 26.9% of peak-hour demand. The peak hour output, which averaged 20,817 MW over the course of the summer, was a 5,408MW increase from just one year ago.

The results clearly show that if you build it, solar will perform.

The same holds true for ERCOT’s dispatchable battery storage resources. There is now 15,008 MW of installed battery storage capacity across the system, which regularly charges off the grid during the early morning when solar output is high and demand low. That power is then returned to the grid in the early evening when demand is still high and solar production is waning.

Battery storage has already set four discharge records in September. The latest occurred last Thursday, Sept. 11, sending 7,741 MW, or 10.6% of total power demand back into the grid in the early evening—and preventing the need for a comparable amount of fossil fuel generation.

These records underscore solar, wind and batteries’ critical role in meeting ERCOT’s growing power demand, which has jumped 5.5% through August compared to the same period in 2024. The system’s just-released generation data through the end of August show that wind and solar supplied 90% of the increased demand, with nuclear power accounting for the remainder. In contrast, generation from the system’s coal and gas-fired resources has fallen so far this year.

Solar has been the driving force in renewables’ recent rise in ERCOT. Through August, solar generation is up 13.8 million megawatt-hours (MWh) compared to 2024 and has supplied 13.8% of total demand year to date. In a first, solar out-generated both coal and wind in August, making it the second-largest resource on the ERCOT grid, trailing only gas. Wind and nuclear generation are also up, although by smaller amounts. On the other hand, coal and gas-fired generation is down 556,838 MWh.

As a percentage of the market, wind and solar have generated 37.7% of ERCOT’s electricity needs through the first eight months of 2025, up almost 3 percentage points from a year ago. A decade ago, when solar first began growing, renewables’ market share was just 15%. Since 2016, demand in ERCOT has jumped 39.2%; renewables have provided the power for 95.7% of that growth.

The 2025 data shows that the transition away from fossil fuels in ERCOT is well under way.",https://ieefa.org/sites/default/files/2025-09/2025-09-15%20IEEFA%20ERCOT%20solar%20wind%20battery%20generation%20records%202023-2025%20v3%20452x236.jpg,N,,2025-09-17 11:00:32.196407

The Timbermill Wind project was a milestone in Norfolk Southern’s partnership with Vestas.","Transporting freight for the energy industry that weighs as much as a house and stretches longer than a city block leaves no room for error. Energy freight shipments, which are often referred to as specialized or dimensional freight, are usually oversized, overweight, and frequently irreplaceable loads that are essential to powering industries and communities.

For the energy sector, dimensional freight is one of the lifelines that moves critical components from factories to job sites. From massive transformers and hydroelectric gates to wind turbines and nuclear reactor parts, these shipments keep infrastructure projects on schedule and make renewable energy expansion possible. According to the Association of American Railroads, moving these critical pieces by rail is a smart choice for economical and sustainable reasons. That’s because moving freight by rail instead of truck reduces emissions by 75%, meaning the clean-energy benefits are multiplied.

Last year, Norfolk Southern partnered with global wind energy leader Vestas to deliver one of the most complex dimensional projects in its history: transporting 158 wind turbine components to the Timbermill Wind farm in Chowan County, North Carolina. This 1,933-acre clean energy site is now operational, featuring 45 turbines generating up to 189 MW.

The project created more than 200 construction jobs and relied heavily on local contractors, with more than $25 million spent with North Carolina businesses during construction. It is projected to generate up to $33 million in tax revenue over its lifetime and is expected to be the county’s largest taxpayer during its first year of operations.

While the shipment itself was a success story, key lessons lie in how the power industry can prepare for the future of complex freight logistics (Figure 1).

Collaboration Is Non-Negotiable

Dimensional freight success begins well before the first shipment moves. For the Timbermill Wind project, Norfolk Southern’s planning started with light detection and ranging (LIDAR) technology-based clearance scans across 10 states, identifying potential obstacles over the 2,000-mile route from Denver to the Port of Morehead City, North Carolina. This proactive engineering approach is essential for:

Avoiding costly last-minute re-routes.

Meeting strict construction schedules.

Maintaining safety compliance in multiple jurisdictions.

Energy developers can reduce risk significantly by bringing transportation providers into the conversation early—ideally during project design—rather than waiting until procurement. Early coordination means the transport plan is built into the project timeline, not added as an afterthought.

Infrastructure Matters—and Is Changing

In 2024, Norfolk Southern invested $1 billion in infrastructure upgrades, including bridge enhancements and terminal improvements, to strengthen its ability to move freight safely and efficiently. For Timbermill Wind, that investment paid off. It allowed Norfolk Southern to move freight loads as large as entire railcars across varied terrain—something that simply isn’t possible without a robust, well-maintained network. Key infrastructure enablers included:

Specialized railcars built to accommodate the dimensions and weight of wind turbine components.

A unique delivery route guided by a coordinated traffic and signage removal plan into the Port of Morehead City, where train cars carrying turbine components traveled directly down tracks that split a four-lane highway in two.

Partnerships across Norfolk Southern’s network and coordination with Carolina Coastal Railway for last-mile delivery.

Selecting a transportation partner with a strong capital investment strategy ensures that today’s infrastructure can support tomorrow’s freight demands—especially as components for renewable projects grow in size and complexity (Figure 2).

Cross-Functional Teams Ensure Precision

A project of this size calls on nearly every part of an organization. At Norfolk Southern, Timbermill Wind mobilized:

Clearance and Engineering for route design and hazard mitigation.

Commercial, Customer Service, Logistics, and Network Operations Center for real-time tracking and seamless coordination.

Short Line for collaboration with other railroads.

Every step was deliberate, from selecting train crews with high-wide, sensitive freight experience to timing train spacing so that these oversized shipments moved without interfering with other network operations. When timelines are tight and cargo is irreplaceable, a coordinated, cross-functional approach is essential.

Local Benefits for North Carolina Communities

Beyond its logistical complexity, the Timbermill Wind project represents a significant step forward for communities in northeastern North Carolina. The renewable energy site is expected to generate enough electricity to power tens of thousands of homes, providing cleaner, more reliable energy for residents and contribute to the state’s ambitious renewable energy goals.

The project also delivers immediate and long-term economic benefits. During construction, local contractors, trucking companies, and port operations all supported the movement and installation of turbine components, bringing jobs and new revenue to the region. Over the life of the wind farm, ongoing operations and maintenance will provide additional employment while generating tax revenue to support schools, infrastructure, and community services.

Environmental benefits are equally important. Timbermill Wind helps cut emissions, creating healthier communities. Rail played a key role in these outcomes: by moving the majority of components by train instead of trucks alone, the project reduced highway congestion and further lowered the carbon footprint of the supply chain.

A Blueprint for the Future

Moving wind turbines, transformers, and other oversized components isn’t just a logistical challenge—it’s a strategic enabler of the clean energy future. Rail’s ability to carry multiple large loads in one trip reduces highway congestion, lowers emissions, and provides a level of reliability that trucking alone cannot match. On average, rail is three to four times more fuel efficient than highway alternatives, making it both an operational and environmental advantage for clean energy developers.

The Timbermill Wind project was a milestone in Norfolk Southern’s partnership with Vestas. Timbermill Wind is expected to help meet North Carolina’s growing demand for renewable power, and demonstrate how Norfolk Southern’s experience and network strength makes it a trusted partner for future renewable energy projects. At Norfolk Southern, these moves are not seen as just freight shipments, but as milestones in powering America’s future.",https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/fig1-vestas-locomotive-norfolk-southern-railroad.jpg,N,,2025-09-17 11:00:45.485169

Arevon’s Project Achievements and Advancements

Arevon’s accomplishments are driven by its ability to bring renewable energy projects from development to financing through to construction and onto successful long-term operations. Over the course of the last year, Arevon has advanced more than 2,000 megawatts (MW) of projects into operations and started construction on 730 MW of new capacity.

Toward the end of 2024, Arevon began operations at its Vikings Solar-plus-Storage Project in Imperial County, California. The $529 million project, which is one of the first utility-scale solar peaker plants in the U.S., combines 157 MWdc of solar with 150 MW/600 megawatt hours (MWh) of battery storage, shifting low-cost daytime solar energy to higher-cost peak demand periods in late afternoons and evenings. Vikings’ financial close was regarded as the nation’s first utility-scale solar peaker plant to leverage tax credit transferability and was recognized by receiving IJGlobal’s Renewables Deal of the Year – Energy Storage Award.

Also among Arevon’s significant achievements was the August 2025 completion of its $2 billion Eland 1 & 2 Solar-plus-Storage Project in Kern County, California. Now fully operational, Eland delivers 758 MWdc of solar generation paired with 300 MW/1,200 MWh of energy storage, making it one of the largest installations of its kind in the nation. The project is capable of powering more than 266,000 homes annually, meeting 7% of Los Angeles’s electricity needs, while its hybrid design enables day-to-night renewable delivery and bolsters grid reliability.

In Missouri, Arevon commenced construction on its Kelso 1 & 2 Solar Project, a $500 million private investment that will boost the state’s installed solar capacity by almost 50 percent when operational. This two-phase project marks Arevon’s first utility-scale solar development in Missouri and features an innovative Environmental Attribute Purchase Agreement with Meta, ensuring traceable renewable energy attribution. Kelso not only adds substantial American-made energy to the region but also channels targeted local investments into schools, infrastructure, and community services.

Additionally, the company announced commercial operations at its $300 million Peregrine Energy Storage Project in San Diego, a 200 MW/400 MWh standalone battery system designed to strengthen California’s grid resilience and facilitate greater integration of renewable generation. Peregrine represents Arevon’s fifth completed utility-scale energy storage facility in California and bolsters the company’s position as a leader in battery storage development and operations.

Arevon also continues to advance construction on its almost $400 million Ratts 1 & Heirloom Solar Projects in Indiana, a combined 265 MW of capacity which are expected to be operational this year, and anticipates starting construction on its 124 MW Big Muddy Solar Project in Illinois before year-end. The company also partnered with local utilities to develop and build an additional 480 megawatts of solar energy in Indiana with the Gibson Solar and Posey Solar projects, ensuring each project was successfully integrated into their communities.

Arevon’s $600 million Nighthawk Energy Storage Project, a 300 MW/1,200 MWh facility in Poway, California, is also under construction, and when operational, will be able to power up to 385,000 homes during the peak electricity demand periods for four hours each day. The project will feature modern lithium iron phosphate batteries which are the safest technology on the market today. Arevon’s number one priority is the safety of those who live and work in its project areas, and the company is proud to have safely operated its energy storage facilities in U.S. communities since 2021.

The money-losing California-based company breaks ground Tuesday east of Atlanta despite President Donald Trump's successful push to roll back electric vehicle tax credits. Starting Sept. 30, buyers will no longer qualify for savings of up to $7,500 per car.

Rivian Chief Policy Officer Alan Hoffman said the company believes it can sell electric vehicles not for environmental or tax incentive reasons, but because they're superior.

""We did not build this company based upon federal tax incentives,"" Hoffman said. ""And we're going to prove that we're going to be successful in the future.""

Georgia plant is key to a mass market and profitability

The Georgia plant, first announced in 2021, is Rivian's key to reaching profitability. Now the company makes the high-end R1T pickup truck and the R1S sport utility vehicle in Normal, Illinois, as well as delivery vans for Amazon and others. Its truck prices start at $71,000.

The Illinois plant will begin making smaller R2 SUVs next year, with prices starting at $45,000. An expanded Illinois plant will be able to assemble 215,000 vehicles yearly. But if the R2 is a hit, and if Rivian successfully produces an even smaller R3, it will need more capacity. The company has said the Georgia operation will be able to make 200,000 vehicles yearly starting in 2028. It plans another 200,000 in capacity in phase two, volume that would spread fixed costs over many more vehicles.

The projections would be a big leap from the 40,000-46,000 vehicles Rivian expects to deliver this year, down from 52,000 last year. The company says it's limiting production now in part to launch 2026 models.

""For Rivian, it's do-or-die time,"" said Alex Oyler, North American director of auto research firm SBD Automotive. ""We saw with Tesla that the key to profitability is scale, and you can't scale if your cheapest vehicle is $70,000. So they need that plant online to achieve a level of scale of R2 and ultimately R3.""

Challenges in the electric vehicle market

Sales growth is slowing for electric vehicles in the United States, rising only 1.5 percent in 2025's first half, according to Cox Automotive.

Tesla accounted for almost 45 percent of U.S. electric vehicle sales in that period, according to Cox. But the giant is losing market share as others gain: General Motors' slice of American EV sales has climbed to 13 percent. By comparison, Rivian had a 3 percent share in the first half of the year, behind Tesla and six traditional automakers.

But excluding Tesla, Rivian is the most successful of the startup automakers.

The company initially tapped a largely unfilled niche: demand for electric pickups and SUVs. But the competition now includes Ford's F-150 Lightning and the electric Chevrolet Silverado.

After an initial public offering in 2021, Rivian shares have fallen by more than 80 percent, while automaker shares overall have outpaced the broader stock market. Rivian lost $1.66 billion in 2025's first half.

At the same time, some automakers' ardor for electric vehicles is cooling. Stellantis last week canceled Ram's electric truck program. Ford has delayed production at a new Tennessee plant. And General Motors abandoned plans to build electric vehicles at a suburban Detroit plant.

""With all the competition out there in this market and the slowing growth of EVs, it does not play in Rivian's favor,"" said Sam Fiorani, a vice president at AutoForecast Solutions. ""However, there still is an EV market out there.""

$1.5 billion in incentives for 7,500 jobs

Georgia has pledged $1.5 billion of incentives to Rivian in exchange for 7,500 company jobs paying at least $56,000 a year on average. Rivian can't benefit from most incentives unless it meets employment goals, but the state is already spending $175 million to buy and grade land and improve roads.

Georgia Republican Gov. Brian Kemp, who has said he wants to make Georgia ""the electric mobility capital of America,"" acknowledges Rivian faces bumps, but says he remains confident the company can fulfill its promises.

While Tesla has thousands of employees in California and Texas, some new electric vehicle plants have sputtered. Two separate EV makers that hoped to assemble vehicles in a former GM plant in Lordstown, Ohio, went bankrupt. Georgia's Hyundai complex near Savannah is faring better, with production underway. However, a battery plant there has been delayed by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement arresting 475 people on site, including more than 300 South Koreans.

Rivian was supposed to be making trucks by now at the 2,000-acre site near Social Circle, about 45 miles east of Atlanta. As the company burned through cash in 2024, it paused construction. But German automaker Volkswagen agreed to invest $5.8 billion in Rivian in exchange for software and electrical technology. And then-President Joe Biden's administration in November agreed to loan Rivian $6.6 billion to build the Georgia plant.

Despite the Trump administration's hostility toward EVs, Hoffman said Rivian hopes the U.S. Department of Energy will distribute the loan money, arguing it will boost domestic manufacturing.

Some neighbors still oppose the plant

Rivian also faces opposition from some residents who say the plant is an inappropriate neighbor to farms and will pollute the groundwater.

""I planned on dying and retiring on the front porch and the biggest project in Georgia has to go next door to me, of all places in the country?"" asked Eddie Clay, who lives less than a mile away. He says his well water turned mud-choked after excavation at the Rivian site.

There are other challenges for Rivian, including tariffs costing $2,000 per vehicle, the Trump administration ending a tax-credit program that will cost the company $140 million in revenue this year, and long-term threats from low-priced, cutting-edge Chinese EVs. But Hoffman says Rivian is ""in this for the long haul.""

""We think that we can compete with anyone out there and that once given the opportunity, we're going to excel,"" he said.",https://wehco.media.clients.ellingtoncms.com/imports/adg/img/2025/09/17/211069066_211069066-0203093a599d443784a6fa93268472aa_t1200.jpg?57a0c2296240c280e9492005c3cad63e7cbe80f4,N,,2025-09-17 13:03:01.048361

Three years ago, gas cost more than $4 per gallon, and prices continued to rise. It felt like price gouging, and my family had no choice but to keep paying for more expensive gasoline. Could an EV (electric vehicle) provide a way out of the fossil fuel money pit?

Like most vehicle purchasers, my husband was hesitant about the cost of a new car and skeptical of EVs. We had never bought new before, and there weren’t really viable used options for EVs at the time. Three things changed his mind. First, we rented an EV on vacation and discovered that charging wasn’t difficult at all. With the car’s built-in trip planner, range anxiety disappeared. A test drive in Tucson sealed the deal — nothing matched the acceleration, quiet power, and thrilling driving experience of an EV.

Second, we realized the full potential of an EV when paired with solar panels. Even without solar, EVs cut transportation costs dramatically. With solar, much of our driving becomes free, and the savings extend to household electricity bills — especially in Arizona summers, when air-conditioning costs skyrocket. With the 30% federal tax credit — and the skyrocketing cost of electricity — the panels are paying paid for themselves quickly.

Third, my husband faced a cancer scare. Suddenly, the “someday” purchases on our bucket list felt urgent. Surviving cancer during middle age reminds you that life isn’t endless. That pushed us over the line to buy the EV.

Today, most of our driving is powered by sunshine. We still own a beater gas car for the teenagers and a minivan for family trips, but my long-term goal is to retire gas engines entirely. Solid-state batteries are on the horizon, promising faster charging and longer range.

Unfortunately, Congress just made purchasing an EV more difficult. As part of the “One Big Beautiful Bill,” they repealed clean energy credits for EVs.They’ll disappear on Sept. 30. Credits for solar disappear in December. Each of our Republican representatives in Arizona voted for this: Andy Biggs, Eli Crane, David Schweikert, Juan Ciscomani, Abraham Hamadeh, and Paul Gosar.

This move not only harms the environment, but it also hurts working families. Wealthier households may still buy solar panels or EVs on their own, but lower- and middle-income families will be locked out. Without credits, many will remain stuck paying hundreds every month for gas or high electric bills instead of investing in cleaner, cheaper alternatives.

Even though renewable energy is less expensive in the long run than fossil fuels, solar and wind require upfront investment. But once installed, the energy is free and inexhaustible. Fossil fuels, on the other hand, demand constant spending on extraction, refining, and transportation. The solar and EV tax credits were designed to bridge that upfront gap, helping families save money and cut pollution. Eliminating the credits takes away opportunity and locks people into outdated, more expensive systems.

There’s still a narrow window. A new EV must be purchased or under binding contract by Sept. 30 to claim a $7,500 credit for a new EV or $4,000 for a used one. That makes a real difference.

My family’s EV purchase gave us a way out. Energy policy should help all families break free from these burdensome expenses, not trap them in. Unfortunately, Congress just pushed us in the wrong direction. The credits create a win-win for everyone — cheaper AND cleaner energy, less smog in our communities. My family and I are seriously considering replacing our minivan before the deadline, especially since I’ve seen three-year-old, seven-seat EVs priced lower than their hybrid competitors once the credit is applied. I want to crawl out of this fossil fuel money pit by acting before the door closes. Why don’t you join us?

And while you’re at it, would you drop a line to your members of Congress, mentioning how important these credits are to you?

Utilities ​“were kicking and screaming on that,” Becker said.
​“SB 254 leaves open a range of possible outcomes on this front,” he added.
(Today, both gas utilities and electric utilities issue climate credits to their customers.)
That provision was strongly opposed by Sempra, the holding company of San Diego Gas & Electric and Southern California Gas Co., the state’s biggest gas-only utility.","California’s Legislature has approved a slate of policies aimed at curbing high and rising electricity costs, involving everything from short-term relief for high summertime utility bills to public financing of transmission grids — a big accomplishment in the waning days of the session.

The affordability measures emerged as part of a sprawling energy and climate package negotiated by legislative leaders and Gov. Gavin Newsom’s office last week and passed by lawmakers Saturday. Newsom, a Democrat, now has until Oct. 12 to sign the bills into law.

“It’s just a massive end of session,” said state Sen. Josh Becker, a Democrat whose bill, SB 254, was included in the package. ​“We had all these planes in the air. Are they all going to crash, or are they going to land?”

Becker hopes the provisions in SB 254 will contain rapidly rising costs for the state’s three biggest utilities — Pacific Gas & Electric, Southern California Edison, and San Diego Gas & Electric — which are in turn driving up rates for their customers. Those residents now pay roughly twice the U.S. average for their power, and nearly one in five are behind on paying their energy bills.

“Energy affordability was understood to be one of the top issues the Legislature needed to act on, due to massive rate increases and widespread customer outrage,” said Matthew Freedman, staff attorney at The Utility Reform Network, a consumer advocacy group that supported SB 254.

Among other things, that legislation aims to rein in how much utilities spend hardening their grids to reduce the risk of sparking wildfires, a major factor in cost increases. To that end, the bill would prohibit utilities from earning profits on some of the investments they make in wildfire-related upgrades.

It would also create a new ​“transmission accelerator” that enables utilities to use public financing to expand the state’s high-voltage grid rather than recoup those expenditures by charging customers. Those savings will take longer to kick in but could add up to billions of dollars a year, said Sam Uden, managing director of Net-Zero California, an advocacy group that cowrote a report last year examining how much utilities could save by relying on public financing.

“There’s a strategic role for public-sector investment to drive the clean energy transition,” he said. ​“We see this transmission financing as an embodiment of that viewpoint.”

Cutting the cost of California’s power grid

SB 254 ended up as a 136-page document with a multitude of energy and climate provisions, Becker told Canary Media last week. But he highlighted one set of key cost-containment measures that the utilities had particularly resisted.

Utilities typically earn a profit by receiving a return on the investments they make in grid upkeep. Now, though, California’s big three utilities will have to finance a portion of what they spend hardening their grids via bonds — a process known as securitization.

Utilities ​“were kicking and screaming on that,” Becker said.

The amount to be financed through bonds was initially set to be $15 billion for all three utilities. But Freedman suggested that the utilities might have used their political clout last week to negotiate the final securitization requirement down to $6 billion, which is ​“a pretty big reduction,” he said.

Regardless, securitizing a portion of the growing grid-hardening costs will reduce pressure on utilities to increase rates in the future, said Merrian Borgeson, California policy director for climate and energy for the Natural Resources Defense Council, which supported the legislation. ​“I don’t know what the rates are going to be next year, but they’ll be lower,” she said.

Enabling public financing of transmission projects could deliver even more savings over time, Borgeson said. The ​“transmission accelerator” created by SB 254 for that purpose would be based out of the Governor’s Office of Business and Economic Development (GO-Biz). That entity would be authorized to pool state funds drawn from California’s cap-and-trade program and from a climate bond passed last year to lower the cost of capital for transmission projects.

The California Independent System Operator, which manages the state’s grid, estimates that California must invest between $46 billion and $63 billion into transmission over the next 20 years to meet its goal of achieving a carbon-free grid by 2045. Using public money to offset a portion of utilities’ capital spending on those projects could cut the costs of the currently planned long-range transmission buildout by more than half, saving customers as much as $3 billion a year, according to an October report from Net-Zero California and the Clean Air Task Force.

Just how much money could be saved will depend on how the accelerator structures its public-private financing, Freedman said. ​“SB 254 leaves open a range of possible outcomes on this front,” he added. ​“It depends on the ambitiousness of the implementation by this and future governors.”

Cap-and-trade climate credit offers fast bill relief

The final days of this year’s session also saw lawmakers reauthorize the state’s decade-old cap-and-trade program, an initiative to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that was set to expire in 2030. AB 1207 and SB 840 would extend the program through 2045 and make a number of changes with significant implications for polluting industries, though regulators and lawmakers still need to work out the exact structures for executing the new rules, Borgeson said.

The bills also take an initial stab at reallocating funds raised by the cap-and-trade system to the myriad state programs and industry sectors jockeying for the money.

For example, one key affordability measure in AB 1207 institutes important changes to the ​“climate credit” now paid to utility customers out of funds collected from the cap-and-trade program.

Today, those credits are delivered to customers in twice-a-year lump-sum rebates. Under the new structure created by AB 1207, those rebates can be redirected to specifically help lower utility bills during summer months, when air conditioning drives up power consumption.

“Just think about the Central Valley,” Becker said during a virtual town-hall event in June, referring to a region of California that’s both hotter and poorer than the rest of the state. During summer heat waves, ​“it’s 100 degrees all day — and sometimes all night — in those areas. It’s literally a matter of life and death to keep the air conditioning on.”

AB 1207 will also redirect climate credits issued to gas utilities to support lowering summer electrical bills exclusively, through a process to be worked out by California utility regulators, Borgeson said. (Today, both gas utilities and electric utilities issue climate credits to their customers.)

That provision was strongly opposed by Sempra, the holding company of San Diego Gas & Electric and Southern California Gas Co., the state’s biggest gas-only utility. In an opposition letter, Sempra said the shift would create a ​“statewide subsidy requiring gas customers to fund bill relief for electric customers, worsening the high cost of living in California for millions of families.”

But climate advocates say the legislation aligns with California’s goal of shifting customers from using gas to using electricity. ​“This is a good idea, because it doesn’t need any more money,” Juliet Christian-Smith, Western states program director at the Union of Concerned Scientists, told Canary Media in July.

EPA is currently reviewing the comments submitted on the “Set 2” proposed rule and working on a final regulation.","WASHINGTON – Today, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is issuing a supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking (SNPRM) that revises the proposed Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) “Set 2” renewable volume requirements (RVOs) for 2026 and 2027 to account for the small refinery exemption (SRE) decisions issued on August 22, 2025. This proposal is an important step in the EPA’s tireless work to repair the damage done after four years of the Biden-Harris Administration neglecting key components of the RFS program, including threats to transform the RFS program into a subsidy for electric vehicle charging stations as part of a larger strategy to electrify the transportation sector. The Trump Administration reaffirms its renewed commitment to honor the program’s purpose to support biofuels as an essential part of a thriving liquid fuels market.

The SNPRM seeks to balance the goals of the RFS program in supporting the production and use of renewable fuels while taking into account economic impacts, following the law, and ensuring opportunity for public comment. Under President Trump, EPA continues to restore the RFS program to align with Congressional directives and give American businesses and rural economies the certainty they need to thrive, all while using homegrown American biofuels.

Specifically, the SNPRM considers how SREs for compliance years 2023 – 2025 will be accounted for when establishing the RVOs in the “Set 2” final rule. EPA is co-proposing two approaches:

1. Additional volumes accounting for 100 percent of the 2023 – 2025 exempted RVOs.

2. Additional volumes accounting for 50 percent of the 2023 – 2025 exempted RVOs.

EPA is also taking comments on SRE reallocation volumes equal to other amounts.

The SRE decisions issued on August 22, 2025, exempted significant volumes of gasoline and diesel for the 2023 and 2024 compliance years, resulting in an increased number of RINs available for obligated parties to use for compliance. EPA also expects additional exemptions to be granted for the 2025 compliance year. The ability for obligated parties to use these RINs to comply with the 2026 and 2027 RVOs is expected to impact demand for renewable fuel if not carefully considered.

Upon publication in the Federal Register, EPA will hold a public hearing followed by a 30-day public comment period. More information about the comment period and public hearing can be found here: https://www.epa.gov/renewable-fuel-standard/proposed-renewable-fuel-standards-2026-and-2027-supplemental-notice. EPA recognizes the importance of issuing one final Set 2 rule that establishes the RVOs for 2026 and 2027 and addresses the reallocation of SREs from 2023 – 2025 in these years.

Background

In June, EPA announced a major step forward to strengthen American energy security and support American farmers by proposing RFS volume requirements for 2026 and 2027. The comment period for the proposed rule closed on August 8, 2025. EPA is currently reviewing the comments submitted on the “Set 2” proposed rule and working on a final regulation.

Develop a diverse and resilient SAF supply chain to meet future demand.

“By investing in the SAF technologies of the future, American and our oneworld partners are making a business decision to accelerate the development of novel technologies with the potential to reach larger scale at lower prices than current technologies can achieve,” said Robert Isom, American Airlines CEO and chairman of oneworld. “We believe reducing the emissions from our operation meets the demands of our customers, will make our business more competitive, and will enable us to continue to deliver the enormous economic benefits of commercial aviation for generations to come.”

“Alaska Airlines is excited to work alongside oneworld carriers to invest in innovative and cost-competitive SAF technology to drive the long-term energy transformation for our industry,” said Ben Minicucci, chief executive officer of Alaska Air Group. “In Breakthrough Energy Ventures, we have a partner with the scientific, technical and commercial expertise to make effective investment decisions that will create the market for next-generation fuels and power our industry in the years ahead.”

“Investing in SAF with Breakthrough Energy Ventures is part of oneworld’s strategy to create a future of aviation that solves problems at scale and serves the needs of the greater aviation community,” said Nat Pieper, chief executive officer of oneworld. ""At oneworld, our member airlines are united in their long-term mission to address carbon emissions and invest in technologies that can improve speed to market of innovative fuels across the globe. By working together, we’ll be better positioned to create long-term solutions for the energy transformation of an industry that is vital to global economic growth.”

BEV, Breakthrough Energy Venture’s capital fund founded by Bill Gates, will serve as the fund’s investment manager, bringing deep technical expertise, a rigorous diligence model, and extensive experience supporting the growth of early-stage climate technology companies. By leveraging its resources to support the energy transformation of one of the most challenging sectors for climate mitigation, BEV aims to advance fuel technologies that offer the greatest potential for tackling the sector’s emissions and securing long-term commercial success.

“Sustainable Aviation Fuel is essential to addressing the sector’s environmental impact and represents a major commercial opportunity,” said Eric Toone, chief technology officer at Breakthrough Energy and managing partner at Breakthrough Energy Ventures. “The oneworld BEV Fund is built to identify and scale breakthrough SAF technologies that can deliver real emissions reductions for jet fuel, compete with fossil-based fuels on cost, and integrate seamlessly with today’s aviation infrastructure. These are complex systems-level challenges that will take time to solve, and the fund is built with the long-term vision and staying power to help bring solutions to market.”

The fund is also supported by oneworld Alliance member airlines International Airlines Group (IAG), Cathay Pacific, and Japan Airlines. Recognizing the power of collective action, oneworld and Breakthrough Energy Ventures made an early decision to welcome non-alliance investors, including Singapore Airlines, which shares the alliance’s commitment to accelerating industry-wide progress in SAF.

“Sustainable Aviation Fuel is the most viable pathway for the aviation industry to progress to reach net zero. With our oneworld partners we have actively supported collective efforts on sustainability and today’s announcement further highlights the potential of collaboration, demonstrating how leading airlines can come together with the goal to accelerate action. To unlock SAF’s full potential, we are calling for supportive policy frameworks that help attract investment and enable the infrastructure needed to kickstart production.”

— Mr. Luis Gallego, chief executive officer, IAG

“As an airline with significant long-haul operations, scaling innovation to make SAF more accessible and cost-competitive is critical to Cathay Pacific’s future. This investment reflects our belief that only through collective action — across geographies and industries — can we build a resilient and scalable SAF ecosystem that delivers meaningful environmental progress and supports the future of our industry. And with Asia continuing to play a pivotal role in the global SAF ecosystem, we’re proud to help lead this momentum from the region.”

— Mr. Ronald Lam, chief executive officer, Cathay Group

“Relationships and connections with countries and regions around the world through air transportation are necessary for an island nation like Japan, thus we believe we have a mission to tackle the environmental impact of air transportation. Working toward this common mission for oneworld, we look forward to promoting technology and the use of SAF together with the member airlines, anticipating expansion into the Asian region in the future.”

— Ms. Tottori Mitsuko, president and representative director, Group CEO, Japan Airlines

“Our investment in this fund demonstrates Singapore Airlines' strong support for developing and commercialising next generation Sustainable Aviation Fuels. Reducing the carbon emissions of jet fuel demands collective action across the entire aviation ecosystem, and such initiatives will drive innovation towards meaningful progress in this crucial energy transformation.”

— Ms. Lee Wen Fen, chief sustainability officer, Singapore Airlines

The global aviation industry, which generates some $4.1 trillion in economic activity and supports 86.5 million jobs, currently accounts for approximately 2-3% of global carbon dioxide emissions, in addition to other environmental impacts. Airlines and manufacturers continue to invest in modern aircraft, engines and operational efficiencies. Demand for air travel is expected to rise in the coming decades, and SAF, which today can reduce lifecycle emissions of jet fuel by up to 80% compared to conventional jet fuel, is a crucial tool for mitigating the industry's environmental impact. While SAF can significantly decrease the carbon dioxide emissions from aircraft engines, the first-generation SAF in production today has come with challenges. The SAF industry has not yet attracted the investment required to scale production at competitive prices in line with market needs, and lifecycle environmental impact is a concern. oneworld and its partners are focused on supporting new technologies that can scale the availability of cost-competitive SAF, while minimizing other environmental impacts.

About ENTEK ENTEK has 40 years of experience producing battery separators for batteries to support electric, advanced start-stop and standard vehicles, trucks, emergency vehicles, emergency backup power, utility scale energy storage, and industrial batteries.
ENTEK is also a vertically integrated designer and manufacturer of extruders and material handling equipment for the production of battery separators and many other non-ENTEK applications.","MIAMI--(BUSINESS WIRE)--I Squared Capital (“I Squared”), a leading global infrastructure investment manager, today announced it has signed a definitive agreement to acquire a majority equity interest in ENTEK Technology Holdings LLC (“ENTEK”), a leading global manufacturer of battery separators.

I Squared’s $800 million investment complements a loan from the U.S. Department of Energy’s Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing (ATVM) program of up to $1.3 billion. With initial funding already provided, these combined investments underscore the importance of strong public-private collaboration in securing U.S. domestic manufacturing of strategic technologies.

The investment will fund construction of a gigafactory in Terre Haute, Indiana – the first and only facility of its kind in the U.S. producing wet-process lithium-ion battery separators, critical components for batteries powering electric vehicles, energy storage systems, defense equipment, and digital infrastructure. The facility is expected to create approximately 763 construction jobs and 635 operations jobs in Terre Haute once operational.

Larry Keith, Chief Executive Officer, ENTEK, said: “For more than 40 years, ENTEK has built a reputation for innovation, quality, and long-term partnerships with the world’s leading energy storage and technology companies. With I Squared’s capital, strategic expertise, and global network, we will expand the U.S.’s manufacturing footprint, create high-quality jobs, and meet surging demand for batteries across critical applications, from EVs and energy storage to military defense equipment and data centers.”

Commenting on the investment, Gautam Bhandari, Managing Partner and Chief Investment Officer, I Squared Capital, said: “ENTEK exemplifies the type of critical, high-growth infrastructure platform that I Squared seeks to scale. ENTEK’s revenues are underpinned by long-term agreements with blue-chip clients, and its products are essential to U.S. re-industrialization and energy security. With DOE support and rising demand in EVs, energy storage, and defense, ENTEK is uniquely positioned to deliver sustainable growth for our investors and the U.S. economy.”

Over the last four decades, ENTEK has developed and built a resilient, vertically integrated business model based on core capabilities in energy storage, advanced materials, and equipment manufacturing. Supported by Endeavour Capital and Joshua Green Corporation’s investment in 2019, ENTEK has grown its operations across eight countries and is the only company to have expanded the application of advanced materials to include all battery separator types, including lead acid, lithium, and other emerging energy storage technologies.

The company’s patent-protected wet process method for lithium-ion battery separators is designed to protect workers, communities, and the environment, while providing strong regulatory and performance advantages. With a substantial majority of its revenue underpinned by long-term contracts, ENTEK is strategically positioned to scale and capture the significant market opportunity for batteries in the U.S., particularly against an uncertain global battery supply chain and a policy environment that prioritizes the onshoring of strategic manufacturing capabilities.

Mike Braun, 52nd Governor of Indiana, said: “This first-of-a-kind gigafactory, built right here in Indiana, will increase energy production and bring down prices, all while boosting our local economy and creating well-paying jobs for hard-working Hoosiers.”

U.S. Senator Todd Young (R-Ind.) said: “ENTEK’s new facility highlights Indiana’s continued leadership in advancing U.S. manufacturing, strengthening America’s competitiveness, and creating quality Hoosier jobs.""

U.S. Senator Jim Banks (R-Ind.) said: “Indiana continues to be a highly attractive place for businesses to invest, and ENTEK’s new factory is a strong testament to the power of investing in America’s security and competitiveness right here at home.”

The Terre Haute, Indiana project, which will be executed in partnership with Clayco as the EPC contractor and Brueckner Group, the world leader in biaxial stretching equipment, will produce 1.4 billion square meters of wet-process lithium-ion battery separators annually in its first two phases and is designed to expand to 2.1 billion square meters. The investment will position ENTEK as the only scaled, U.S.-based supplier able to meet the sourcing requirements for battery manufacturers to receive 45X production tax credits and comply with the content requirements under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), as amended by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), which reduce the allowance for Chinese materials – including separators. ENTEK’s product will provide a significant advantage to battery manufacturing customers seeking credits under the OBBBA.

In addition to the DOE’s up to $1.3 billion ATVM loan, the project has secured more than $200 million in 48C advanced manufacturing tax credits for Phase One of the project and will be eligible for ongoing 45X production tax credits in Phase Two.

The transaction is expected to close following regulatory approvals.

,EVs,2025-09-17 12:45:51+00:00,The Pointer,EVs left in limbo after Mark Carney hits the brakes on sales mandate | The Pointer,Not Available,,,,,https://thepointer.com/article/2025-09-17/evs-left-in-limbo-after-mark-carney-hits-the-brakes-on-sales-mandate,"The EV sales mandate was the sole major policy from the 2022 climate plan that has moved forward.
“It's not just that government legislated EV sales targets—by doing so, they effectively compelled both industry and government to take action to meet them.
“It would be one thing if, each time the Carney government jettisoned a key climate policy, they were replacing it with something else.
Kyriazis notes that the EV sales mandate “often gets debated as if it’s about the auto industry, but really, it’s consumer-focused.
In 2017, EV sales in Ontario surged to 7,477 units, a 120 percent increase from the previous year.","Toronto resident Rick Smith has been eyeing an electric vehicle for months, but “regulatory uncertainty at the federal level” has kept him and his family from making the switch. The hesitation only deepened after Prime Minister Mark Carney announced a pause on Canada’s EV mandate.

On September 5, Carney said the government would suspend the mandate for 2026, and initiated a 60-day review period to determine the future of the keystone climate policy.

First introduced in 2021 under former prime minister Justin Trudeau, the policy required automakers selling passenger cars, SUVs and pickup trucks in Canada to meet rising zero-emission vehicle sales targets: 20 percent by 2026 and 100 percent by 2035.

Once hailed as a cornerstone of Canada’s net-zero strategy, the EV mandate is now on shaky ground, alongside the unfunded federal rebate, rising tariffs on Chinese models and a growing patchwork of inconsistent provincial policies.

While Ontario Premier Doug Ford and Carney placate the auto industry and the oil giants that drive it, experts warn the real cost of delay may be borne by Canadian drivers left with fewer affordable options, and a country falling behind as the world goes electric.

The pause announced by Carney is part of a broader package of measures to support industries most affected by U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs, with the EV mandate also set to be waived for 2026 models.

“The direction the federal government takes on the EV availability standard is going to be a real litmus test of how committed the Carney government is to defending existing climate policies, let alone introducing new ones. With the removal of the consumer carbon price, which helped Canadians make cleaner choices, the EV standard now carries extra weight in reducing emissions from transportation,” Clean Energy Canada’s director of policy and strategy, Joanna Kyriazis, told The Pointer.

“If the government caves to opposition and abandons this policy entirely, unfortunately, it would open the floodgates and allow opposition parties, other premiers, industry to just start picking off all of the other climate policies on the books one by one, and use the same playbook of political polarization.”

In an email to Brampton North—Caledon Liberal MP Ruby Sahota, Brampton Environmental Alliance president David Laing expressed deep disappointment over Carney’s announcement.

Laing wrote that he voted for the Liberal Party this past spring because he believed Carney was the only leader who truly understood the science of climate change, the urgency of national action and the political skill needed to balance environmental sustainability with economic growth.

Instead, he said, the Prime Minister has capitulated—scrapping the consumer carbon tax, weakening environmental protections, greenlighting further oil and gas infrastructure, including pipelines through northern British Columbia and now walking back EV targets under pressure from the auto industry.

“Please help me understand why your leader has chosen to take this position, knowing that his actions will only contribute to greater global warming, leading to further environmental destruction, property loss and human suffering. Where is the other side of the equation? Why is he not demanding from industry and provincial leaders that he can help them grow their businesses and economies only if they take swift and aggressive action to reduce emissions? That’s the leader I thought I was voting for. So disappointed,” Laing wrote in the email, shared with The Pointer.

The EV sales mandate was the sole major policy from the 2022 climate plan that has moved forward. With its suspension, the Liberal government’s climate efforts in Canada now seem to have stagnated, as Carney has clearly pivoted more to the right of centre on issues that Conservatives have long championed.

Critics wonder if the new PM’s moves are more political calculation than sound economic policy, as the minority Liberals plot a path to govern while trying to make all sides happy. Some warn it could backfire, alienating the progressive Liberal base, while failing to woo right-of-centre voters, the vast majority of whom stuck with the Conservatives, despite the Trump bump Carney benefitted from. The Liberals won the election largely due to the slumping NDP, whose frustrated supporters might not give Carney a second chance if he continues to walk back past environmental commitments under Justin Trudeau, while contradicting much of his claimed advocacy before entering politics.

Climate Emergency Unit’s director of Strategy Seth Klein fears the pause on the 2026 ZEV sales mandate may just be the beginning of a wider rollback of key policies previous Liberal governments implemented strategically.

“It's not just that government legislated EV sales targets—by doing so, they effectively compelled both industry and government to take action to meet them. The mandates didn’t stand alone. They were supported by a carbon price that made gas-powered vehicles more expensive to operate, investments in charging infrastructure and consumer rebates to lower the upfront cost of EVs. Now, one by one, those supporting measures are being stripped away,” Klein said.

“I think they're [now] caving to industry, to the manufacturers who never wanted the mandates.”

In July, when Carney met with automotive sector leaders to discuss U.S. trade negotiations as concerns were mounting that tariffs and counter-tariffs could drive up the price of new cars, including EVs, one of the main demands from the industry was for him to scrap the ZEV sales mandate.

In May, an Electric Mobility Canada (EMC) study found that most EV models available in Canada are not subject to the country’s 21.25 percent automotive counter-tariffs, as the majority of EVs sold here are imported from outside the U.S. It urged the federal government to uphold the EV Availability Standard, arguing that it is essential to ensuring continued access to a growing variety of electric vehicles, including more affordable models for Canadian consumers.

A May 2025 study by Electric Mobility Canada found that out of 89 battery electric and plug-in hybrid models offered by 33 automakers in Canada, only six are impacted by the federal automotive counter-tariffs, representing less than seven percent of available models and under five percent of total EV sales in 2024.

(EMC)

Klein, too, wishes the government weren’t pausing the policy and finds its direction unclear, especially after its first act, scrapping the consumer carbon price in April, was not followed by an equivalent or stronger replacement.

“It would be one thing if, each time the Carney government jettisoned a key climate policy, they were replacing it with something else. But they aren't,” Klein told The Pointer.

Smith, who is president of the Canadian Climate Institute, echoed the concern, pointing to the broader uncertainty now facing the country. “Canadians and the market and investors are plunged into an open-ended two-month review. So it's a general lack of clarity on climate change policy that we think needs to end.”

A 2021 report by the Canadian Climate Institute, a policy think-tank partly funded by Environment and Climate Change Canada, modelled 60 different pathways to net-zero and found that the transition to zero-emission vehicles was a cornerstone of every scenario, and one of the safest bets for the country.

(Canadian Climate Institute)

The EV sales mandate was a key part of Canada’s strategy to decarbonize the transportation sector, one of the largest sources of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In 2021, transportation was responsible for 187.7 megatonnes of GHGs, accounting for 28 percent of the national total. The vast majority of those emissions came from road vehicles.

That year, the country’s total GHG emissions stood at 670.4 megatonnes, a decline of 10.4 percent from the 2007 peak of 748.1 megatonnes.

A 2024 study by the University of Guelph found that the federal ZEV mandate would reduce Canada’s GHG emissions by roughly eight percent by 2050 compared to a scenario without the policy. Scrapping the mandate would mean losing that eight percent reduction.

It would also result in over $90 billion in health benefits for Canadians over the next 25 years, including up to 11,000 avoided premature deaths, according to a 2023 report from The Atmospheric Fund.

A 2025 Health Canada analysis shows that the air pollution from on-road vehicles nationally contributes to an estimated 1,200 premature deaths and millions of cases of non-fatal health outcomes annually, with a total estimated economic cost of $9.5 billion each year. The emissions from light-duty vehicles contribute a little over a third of those health impacts.

By 2050, the regulations are projected to reduce various air pollutant emissions from light-duty vehicles, including reducing fine particular matter (PM 2.5) by 36 percent, nitrogen oxide by 50 percent, volatile organic compounds by 61 percent, and carbon monoxide by 68 percent.

“The regulations will contribute to Canada’s climate change goals by preventing 362 megatonnes of cumulative greenhouse gas emissions. The monetized benefits of reducing these greenhouse gas emissions are estimated to be about $96 billion,” a government of Canada report noted.

“Even accounting for the higher purchase price of many ZEVs in 2023, these greenhouse gas benefits, together with the estimated $36.7 billion in reduced energy costs over the next 25 years, give these regulations an estimated total net benefit of $78.6 billion.”

In 2021, the Census of Population found that 83.9 percent of Canada’s 13.1 million commuters, about 11 million people, travelled by car, truck, or van, with nearly nine in ten driving alone, while 13.9 percent relied on sustainable transportation such as transit (7.7 percent) or walking and cycling (6.2 percent), and 2.2 percent used other methods. Commuting habits were still shaped by the pandemic, which saw 24.3 percent of workers at home, but patterns began shifting back by May 2022 as restrictions eased, with Labour Force Survey data showing 12.5 million Canadians commuting by car, surpassing pre-pandemic levels, and vehicle registration trends highlighting a broader transition as gasoline’s share of new registrations dropped from 88 percent in 2020 to 80.6 percent in late 2022 while hybrid, plug-in hybrid, and battery electric vehicles more than doubled to 14.7 percent of new registrations. The momentum is now at risk as Ontario Premier Doug Ford’s August 14, 2025 order requiring all provincial public servants to return to the office full-time by January 2026 could put more cars back on the road and drive emissions upward.

The federal government’s approach to emissions policy is also shifting. Carney has declined to endorse firm GHG targets, saying he's focused on ""results, not objectives"".

During a September 12 media briefing in Winnipeg, energy minister Tim Hodgson said Ottawa is in active discussions with Alberta and the oil industry about the future of the sector’s emissions cap, but did not confirm whether the cap would be scrapped.

Hodgson said all parties agree on the need for a ""fundamental change in the emissions intensity of the oilsands.""

Since the announcement, reaction to the EV mandate pause has been mixed. Some industry voices point to tariffs and slowing sales as reasons to hit pause. Many advocates argue demand has not dried up—rather, it has been hampered by the end of federal rebates and limited vehicle availability at dealerships.

In 2024, approximately one in seven new vehicles sold in Canada (13.8 percent) was a zero-emission vehicle (ZEV), according to Statistics Canada. More than 264,000 ZEVs were purchased that year, valued at $17.3 billion. Sales were noticeably stronger in the second half of the year, peaking in September with 30,318 cars sold as new models entered the market.

Monthly new motor vehicle sales in 2024, broken down by total and zero-emission vehicles, show that overall sales peaked in May at 185,178 units, and zero-emission vehicle sales reached a high of 30,318 units in September, reflecting growing consumer interest in cleaner transportation options.

Momentum faltered in early 2025 after the Incentives for Zero-Emission Vehicles (iZEV) Program, which offered rebates of up to $5,000, ran out of funds in January, two months ahead of schedule due to high demand. Industry experts say its end and the absence of funding for the program since, contributed to falling sales.

A recent S&P report highlighted EV sales in Canada reached 19 percent in Q4 2024, just shy of the 20 percent target set for 2026, before federal purchase incentives were abruptly cut. The final share for the year landed at 15 percent.

Smith says uncertainty is now the biggest barrier for buyers.

“Our next car is going to be an EV. But there's been regulatory uncertainty at the federal level as to whether this availability standard would continue, and the purchase incentives to buy electric vehicles ran out earlier in the year,” he added.

“This current federal government was elected on a platform of bringing those back, and so there's just a lot of uncertainty in the car market when it comes to electric vehicles, and that's translating to a lack of choice with dealerships.”

Smith has been searching for an EV in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) for months, but affordable models remain scarce.

“For a number of the most popular brands, there isn’t much stock. When you ask a dealer about a new model in a preferred colour, the answer is often, ‘maybe in a few months.’ That’s why we need the (EV) availability standard, because globally, EVs are taking over, and Canada risks falling behind,” he posited.

“I think in our country at the moment, because we live next to the United States, and Donald Trump has been so vitriolic in his opposition to our climate policy…there's a tendency in Canada to believe that the whole world has turned against electric vehicles. And in fact, the absolute opposite is the case.”

More than 17 million electric cars were sold worldwide in 2024, making up over 20 percent of all new vehicle sales, a sharp increase from the previous year, according to the International Energy Agency’s (IEA) Global EV Outlook 2025.

Sales are projected to exceed 20 million in 2025, with electric vehicles expected to account for one in every four new cars sold. China maintained its lead, with EV sales topping 11 million, with electric cars accounting for almost half of all car sales in 2024.

“The over 11 million electric cars sold in China last year were more than global sales just two years earlier,” the report noted.

“The rapid growth in electric car sales over the past five years has had a significant impact on the global car fleet: At the end of 2024, the electric car fleet had reached almost 58 million, about four percent of the total passenger car fleet and more than triple the total electric car fleet in 2021. Notably, the global stock of electric cars displaced over one million barrels per day of oil consumption in 2024. Of course, the stock of electric cars is not spread evenly across the world – in China, for example, around one in ten cars on the road is now electric, whereas in Europe the ratio is closer to one in twenty,” the IEA report noted.

Even in the U.S., the electric car market share continued to grow in 2024, with sales reaching 1.6 million. While the market share increased by ten percent, this is a decline from the significant jump of 40 percent recorded in 2023.

The launch of 24 new electric models expanded consumer choice and increased competition, contributing to a decline in Tesla’s market share from 60 percent in 2020 to 38 percent in 2024, as other automakers saw a 20 percent increase in sales.

Policy changes, including an update to the Clean Vehicle Tax Credit that allowed buyers to receive an instant rebate at the point of sale, likely encouraged adoption, especially with over half of EV sales qualifying for the incentive. Leasing also surged, driven by a 2023 provision reclassifying leased EVs as commercial vehicles, making them broadly eligible for tax credits. By 2024, nearly half of all EVs sold in the U.S. were leased, supported further by additional state-level incentives offered in 27 states.

In Europe, EV sales stagnated in 2024 as subsidies and other supportive policies began to fade. Still, electric vehicles maintained a 20 percent share of new car sales, with gains in 14 EU member states offsetting declines in others.

In larger markets like Germany and France, EV sales slowed as governments scaled back incentives. Germany ended subsidies at the end of 2023, and France has progressively reduced them, including capping environmental bonuses for higher-income buyers and limiting eligibility for support in 2024.

In the United Kingdom, Europe’s second-largest car market, electric vehicles made up nearly 30 percent of new car sales in 2024, up from 24 percent the previous year. This marked the first year of the Vehicle Emissions Trading Scheme, which required 22 percent of new vehicle registrations to be either battery electric (BEV) or fuel cell electric (FCEV).

In Denmark, the electric vehicle share rose by ten percentage points to reach 56 percent, with nearly 100,000 EVs sold in 2024.

Norway reached near-total electrification of sales, with 88 percent of car sales being battery electric and just under three percent plug-in hybrid. The growing share of electric cars led to a 12 percent drop in road-related oil consumption compared to 2021. A planned tax hike on internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles and plug-in hybrids, which started in April, is expected to push the battery electric share even higher as the country aims for 100 percent zero-emission car sales by the end of 2025.

In Canada, mandates have been effective, and provincial programs have already shown the impact well-designed incentives can have.

Quebec led the country in 2024, accounting for more than half (53.9 percent) of all ZEV sales in Canada. Its Roulez vert program offered rebates of up to $7,000, and when combined with the federal rebate, Quebec buyers could save as much as $12,000. The looming reduction of the provincial rebate to $4,000 in January 2025 spurred a year-end sales rush. By year’s end, ZEVs made up 30.1 percent of new vehicle sales in the province, the highest proportion in Canada.

British Columbia and the territories ranked second, where ZEVs represented 20.7 percent of new purchases. B.C.’s rebate program offers residents up to $4,000, with additional amounts based on income and vehicle type.

Elsewhere, adoption was slower: Prince Edward Island (7.8 percent), Ontario (7.4 percent)—slowed by Premier Doug Ford’s cut to preexisting subsidies— Nova Scotia (6.5 percent), New Brunswick (5.7 percent), Manitoba (4.9 percent), Alberta (4.2 percent), Newfoundland and Labrador (2.6 percent) and Saskatchewan (2.5 percent).

Despite Ottawa’s orders, B.C. Minister of Energy and Climate Solutions Adrian Dix indicated the province is in talks with automakers and open to “moderating” its targets, but he emphasized that the mandate remains in place.

“We have to make changes in those targets…The question is: do we want to be with the direction of the whole world, or with Mr. Trump?"" Dix said.

Kyriazis notes that the EV sales mandate “often gets debated as if it’s about the auto industry, but really, it’s consumer-focused. Its goal is to make EVs more accessible, affordable, and available for Canadians.”

A recent Abacus Data survey conducted for Clean Energy Canada found that 45 percent of Canadians are certain, very likely, or inclined to choose an EV for their next vehicle. Support is especially strong in provinces like Quebec (55 percent) and B.C. (53 percent), as well as among younger Canadians aged 18 to 29 (57 percent) and 30 to 44 (52 percent).

Despite slower EV adoption in several provinces, a majority of Canadians, especially in major urban centres and younger age groups, remain interested in going electric, with surveys showing support increases further when people are given more information.

(Clean Energy Canada)

In major urban centres, the appetite for EVs is even stronger. A separate survey conducted in the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area (GTHA) and Metro Vancouver found that 69 percent of Metro Vancouver respondents favoured EVs.

In the GTHA, where actual EV uptake has lagged, 55 percent still said they preferred an EV over a gas-powered car, and that figure jumped to 62 percent when respondents were given more information about EVs, pointing to significant potential for growth with better public education and policy support.

Ahead of last week’s announcement, Carney had the backing of Premier Ford, who repeatedly called for an end to the federal EV sales mandate in recent months, even as his government poured billions into Ontario’s growing EV and battery manufacturing sector.

“We have to get rid of these mandates so that companies won’t be able to meet their targets. The market will dictate, not governmental dictate,” Ford said during a press conference in July.

Those words were in stark contrast with what the premier had said in January, before the surprise federal election was called, when he pledged to continue supporting Ontario’s EV industry if re-elected.

“I want (to) make it clear that every partner we have in Ontario's electric vehicle and battery supply chain, a reelected PC government will honour our commitment,” Ford said.

When Doug Ford became premier in 2018, his government quickly rolled back several key policies that had been accelerating electric vehicle (EV) adoption in Ontario. Among the first cuts were provincial rebates for EV purchases, incentives for installing home and workplace chargers and EV-friendly provisions in the Ontario Building Code. Public charging stations including those at GO Transit locations were removed, and the cap-and-trade program that funded EV incentives was dismantled. Just eight years after Ontario launched its EV support programs, they were effectively shut down. Ford dismissed the initiatives, claiming they mostly benefited “millionaires who could afford Teslas,” but the numbers told a different story. In 2017, EV sales in Ontario surged to 7,477 units, a 120 percent increase from the previous year. But after the cuts, sales fell sharply: by mid-2019, EV sales were down more than 55 percent compared to the same period in 2018, with second-quarter sales dropping from 7,110 to just 2,933. The downward trend persisted. In 2022, the Ford government released a revised climate plan that made little mention of EVs, despite transportation remaining the largest source of emissions in the province. That same plan was described by the government’s own lawyers in court as little more than a “glossy brochure,” while Ontario’s emissions reached 157 megatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent.

The Progressive Conservative government has also hinted at Ontario’s EV expansion as a key argument for pushing Bill 5, dubbed the Protect Ontario by Unleashing our Economy Act, and accelerating mining in the Ring of Fire, a region rich in minerals but also home to vast peatlands that act as one of the world’s largest carbon sinks.

“I think of some of our broader environmental goals, and one is sustainability. We’re developing, certainly in my community, the electric vehicle industry and, ultimately, for the success of that industry, mining of critical minerals is vital,” PC MPP for Windsor–Tecumseh Andrew Dowie said during the Standing Committee on the Interior meeting for Bill 5 on May 22.

“Also, I find, having now purchased an electric car—I bought it used—boy, I feel like I’m saving a lot of money by not having to fuel it up and use fossil fuels. I feel my environmental footprint is far better than it was before.”

“Canadians know EVs will save them money over time, because they are so much cheaper to fuel and maintain. But it is that upfront cost that continues to be a hurdle, and especially when geopolitics has led countries to box out China and Chinese technology, where so many investments have been made and so much of the cost reductions have been achieved,” Clean Energy Canada’s Joanna Kyriazis said.

“In China, EVs are already cheaper upfront than gas cars, but now we're putting tariffs on those vehicles and those batteries, and so we're kind of pushing out the timeline for when we get to see more affordable EVs upfront.”

Calling Chinese tariffs “the most challenging piece,” Klein says, when the government imposed the 100 percent tariff on Chinese EVs a year ago, he was of two minds.

“On one hand, I understood the need to give our industry time to ramp up without being undercut by lower-cost Chinese models. But now, instead of using that time to ramp up production, we’ve effectively given them permission not to,” he added.

“It’s the worst of both worlds. If we’re going to pause the ZEV mandate, then at least make those Chinese EVs more affordable and let them compete.”

Kyriazis argues that Canada should prioritize making electric vehicles more affordable. The EV availability standard is a key policy to do that—by increasing its stringency, it pressures automakers to shift their focus from luxury models to more accessible, mass-market options.

A 2022 study by Environmental Defence found that enforcing a Clean Car Standard could reduce the median EV price by over 20 percent or roughly $7,200, help Canada meet or exceed its ZEV sales targets, cut 135 million tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions by 2035 and ensure the cost of the transition is carried by automakers rather than the public.

She suggests that to balance flexibility for automakers with affordability goals, the policy could offer extra credits for EVs priced under $40,000, the maximum most Canadians want to spend, and for incentives like zero-percent financing, helping lower costs and boost adoption without weakening the policy.

Given the tariff concerns, she notes that automakers operating in Canada also serve the much larger U.S. market, where the recent repeal of fuel efficiency standards by the Trump administration is expected to save them billions in compliance costs — a windfall she says ""should offset tariff impacts, making it easier for automakers to meet Canadian EV sales targets.""

She also urges Canada to revisit tariffs on Chinese-made EVs. “Unlike Canada and the U.S., the UK and EU applied little or no tariffs, encouraging competition and lower-priced models. Reducing tariffs here could help fill the gap for EVs under $40,000.”

A September 2025 report by TD economists supports this view, arguing that Canada should consider strategic partnerships with China to strengthen its EV ecosystem and achieve climate goals. The current blanket tariff approach has limited access to advanced battery technology and affordable EV options, both key to improving adoption.

Chinese firms are leading in low-cost manufacturing, battery innovation and fast-charging technology. Selective, well-managed partnerships such as licensing deals, joint research and development, or battery supply agreements could accelerate innovation, lower costs and expand consumer choice, which in turn would help reverse Canada’s declining EV sales and support domestic production.

Kyriazis emphasizes the need for a broader EV affordability package alongside policy improvements: “First, bring back the federal EV rebate, which has been paused since January. This pause has created pent-up demand and artificially lowered EV sales because buyers are waiting to see if the $5,000 incentive will return.”

Clean Energy Canada’s director of policy and strategy, Joanna Kyriazis, and 70 percent of Canadians support allowing the sale of EVs approved by the EU’s safety standards in Canada. “Currently, Canada aligns with U.S. standards and misses out on many affordable models available in the EU. Recognizing EU standards would open the market to these vehicles, making EVs more accessible,” she noted.

“We need to mainstream EVs by getting them into the hands of everyday Canadians, not just early adopters with higher incomes,” Kyriazis said.

“A retooled EV availability standard that balances flexibility with a strong long-term signal, combined with restoring rebates and easing trade barriers, is how Canada can truly advance the electric vehicle revolution.”

The Atmospheric Fund’s climate policy analyst Samia Anwer believes Canada is at a critical juncture where it has the opportunity to chart its own path instead of following in the footsteps of our neighbours.

“To ensure long-term environmental and economic resilience, Canada must decouple its regulatory direction from the United States. We can no longer afford to be reactive, especially with emissions targets, resident health and safety and local economic opportunities hanging in the balance,” Anwer explained in a statement.

“Key Canadian policies on energy efficiency and clean transportation emissions are at risk. Rather than watering down our standards in response to U.S. rollbacks, Canada should double down – defending, modernizing, and strengthening our own regulations to reflect Canadian priorities, economic conditions and climate commitments. Our environment, our economy and our future depend on it.”

(AP) — With the explosive growth of Big Tech’s data centers threatening to overload U.S. electricity grids, policymakers are taking a hard look at a tough-love solution: bumping the energy-hungry data centers off grids during power emergencies.

Texas moved first, as state lawmakers try to protect residents in the data-center hotspot from another deadly blackout, like the winter storm in 2021 when dozens died.

Now the concept is emerging in the 13-state mid-Atlantic grid and elsewhere as massive data centers are coming online faster than power plants can be built and connected to grids. That has elicited pushback from data centers and Big Tech, for whom a steady power supply is vital.

Like many other states, Texas wants to attract data centers as an economic boon, but it faces the challenge of meeting the huge volumes of electricity the centers demand. Lawmakers there passed a bill in June that, among other things, orders up standards for power emergencies when utilities must disconnect big electric users.

That, in theory, would save enough electricity to avoid a broad blackout on the handful of days during the year when it is hottest or coldest and power consumption pushes grids to their limits or beyond.

Texas was first, but it won’t be the last, analysts say, now that the late 2022 debut of OpenAI’s ChatGPT ignited worldwide demand for chatbots and other generative AI products that typically require large amounts of computing power to train and operate.

“We’re going to see that kind of thing pop up everywhere,” said Michael Webber, a University of Texas engineering professor who specializes in energy. “Data center flexibility will be expected, required, encouraged, mandated, whatever it is.”

Data centers are threatening grids

That’s because grids can’t keep up with the fast-growing number of data center projects unfolding in Texas and perhaps 20 other states as the U.S. competes in a race against China for artificial intelligence superiority.

Grid operators in Texas, the Great Plains states and the mid-Atlantic region have produced eye-popping projections showing that electricity demand in the coming years will spike, largely due to data centers.

A proposal similar to Texas’ has emerged from the nation’s biggest grid operator, PJM Interconnection, which runs the mid-Atlantic grid that serves 65 million people and data-center hotspots in Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania.

The CEO of the Southwest Power Pool, which operates the grid that serves 18 million people primarily in Kansas, Oklahoma and other Great Plains states, said it has no choice but to expand power-reduction programs — likely for the biggest power users — to meet growing demand.

The proposals are cropping up at a time when electricity bills nationally are rising fast — twice the rate of inflation, according to federal data — and growing evidence suggests that the bills of some regular Americans are rising to subsidize the gargantuan energy needs of Big Tech.

Analysts say power plant construction cannot keep up with the growth of data center demand, and that something must change.

“Data center load has the potential to overwhelm the grid, and I think it is on its way to doing that,” said Joe Bowring, who heads Monitoring Analytics, the independent market watchdog in the mid-Atlantic grid.

Data centers might have to adjust

Big Tech is trying to make their data centers more energy efficient. They are also installing backup generators, typically fueled by diesel, to ensure an uninterrupted power supply if there’s a power outage.

Data center operators, however, say they hadn’t anticipated needing that backup power supply to help grid operators meet demand and are closely watching how utility regulators in Texas write the regulations.

The Data Center Coalition, which represents Big Tech companies and data center developers, wants the standards to be flexible, since some data centers may not be able to switch to backup power as easily or as quickly as others.

The grid operator also should balance that system with financial rewards for data centers that voluntarily shut down during emergencies, said Dan Diorio of the Data Center Coalition.

Nation’s largest grid operator has a proposal

PJM’s just-released proposal revolves around a concept in which proposed data centers may not be guaranteed to receive electricity during a power emergency.

That’s caused a stir among power plant owners and the tech industry.

Many questioned PJM’s legal authority to enforce it or warned of destabilizing energy markets and states scaring off investors and developers with uncertainty and risk.

“This is particularly concerning given that states within PJM’s footprint actively compete with other U.S. regions for data center and digital infrastructure investment,” the Digital Power Network, a group of Bitcoin miners and data center developers, said in written comments to PJM.

The governors of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Illinois and Maryland said they worried that it’s too unpredictable to provide a permanent solution and that it should at least be accompanied by incentives for data centers to build new power sources and voluntarily reduce electricity use.

Others, including consumer advocates, warned that it won’t lower electric bills and that PJM should instead pursue a “bring your own generation” requirement for data centers to, in essence, build their own power source.

A deal is shrouded in secrecy

In Indiana, Google took a voluntary route.

Last month, the electric utility, Indiana & Michigan Power, and the tech giant filed a power-supply contract with Indiana regulators for a proposed $2 billion data center planned in Fort Wayne in which Google agreed to reduce electricity use there when the grid is stressed. The data center would, it said, reduce electricity use by delaying non-urgent tasks to when the electric grid is under less stress.

However, important details are being kept from the public and Ben Inskeep of the Citizens Action Coalition, a consumer advocacy group, said that leaves it unclear how valuable the arrangement really is, if at all.

A new way of thinking about electricity

To an extent, bumping big users off the grid during high-demand periods presents a new approach to electricity.

It could save money for regular ratepayers, since power is most expensive during peak usage periods.

Abe Silverman, an energy researcher at Johns Hopkins University, said that data centers can and do use all the electricity they want on most days.

But taking data centers off the grid for those handful of hours during the most extreme heat or cold would mean not having to spend billions of dollars to build a bunch of power plants, he said.

“And the question is, is that worth it? Is it worth it for society to build those 10 new power plants just to serve the data centers for five hours a year?” Silverman said. “Or is there a better way to do it?”

In July 2023, the city of Moorpark adopted new zoning regulations that allowed the facilities with conditions.

Citing concerns about fire risks, the City Council has since voted to prohibit the sites completely.

Unless approved directly by the state, battery energy storage systems will no longer be allowed in Moorpark.

The City Council voted unanimously Sept. 3 to ban the facilities, which store excess electricity that can be released during peak demand times, from indoor use in industrial areas. Council members cited concerns about fire risks, which they said residents shared.

“I’m doing my job and listening to people in the city, and the people in the city are very concerned about this, so we’ve had a more stringent stance on battery storage,” Mayor Chris Enegren said. “This isn’t something that we wanted to lead the charge on.”

The city has rejected two proposals for battery storage projects, one outdoor and one indoor, since changing regulations to allow them in certain circumstances two years ago. City leaders cited similar safety concerns as the reason for their decision. A bill in the State Assembly, however, could allow companies to bypass local bans.

In July 2023 after Moorpark updated its general plan, the council adopted new zoning regulations that allowed battery energy storage systems with a conditional-use permit indoors within four zones: industrial park, limited industrial, institutional and industrial-flex zones.

Since then, several companies proposed battery energy storage systems to city officials over the years, but only two submitted applications.

Roughly a year later, Hecate Energy challenged the zoning code. The Chicago-based renewable power and storage company submitted an application to construct an outdoor battery energy storage system on a vacant property north of Southern California Edison's equipment staging yard that was zoned for limited industrial use. The company said outdoor facilities were safer in the event of a fire.

Hecate did not respond to an interview request.

The City Council voted unanimously Sept. 18, 2024, to reject a city staff recommendation that the company could apply to amend the zoning rules for the project. They cited safety concerns and an unwillingness to set a precedent for outdoor facilities.

That same month, Prologis, a San Francisco-based real estate company, applied to build an indoor battery energy storage system at 11289 W. Los Angeles Ave., also near the Southern California Edison facility on Gabbert Road. The application is still incomplete.

“For Moorpark, it would mean reliable power; hundreds of jobs tied to the construction of the battery project and logistics facility, along with permanent jobs with the logistics facility; millions in tax revenue for schools and city services; and infrastructure upgrades,” Jacob Morgan, Prologis vice president of development, wrote in an email interview.

The council expressed an interest in reassessing the zoning code in November 2024, determining that battery energy storage systems were not a desired use within city limits.

Though the council cited a desire to use its already limited industrial space for land uses that generate more jobs, the primary factor in the rejection was safety concerns.

Enegren said that if the council had known more about the technology at the time, they would not have allowed it anywhere in the city under the zoning code update.

All four city zones where the facilities were previously allowed are near residential neighborhoods and most were in what are considered very high fire hazard severity zones. Of the three State Fire Marshal designations, the zone carries the most risk for a wildfire.

Ventura County Fire Department officials warned city officials of the risks of the technology and the burden on first responders, especially after similar California facilities in Moss Landing, Escondido and Valley Center made headlines after fires erupted. The former incident burned for days, forcing 1,200 people to evacuate and emitting toxic chemicals.

The city’s concerns were echoed by many residents, Enegren said, leading him to believe that the safety risks outweighed any potential benefits.

“I’m not sure if this is going to help or hurt, but I do know that facilities burning down and residents being concerned is a big deal,” he said.

Of the three public speakers during the July 16 hearing, all were Prologis employees seeking to stop the decision.

“Safety is the No. 1 concern for Prologis,” Morgan told the Star. “Battery technology has advanced significantly. The high-profile battery fires people remember used older, more volatile systems that are no longer standard.”

The proposed project would have used lithium iron phosphate batteries that are designed to self extinguish if a fire were to occur and would have also incorporated cooling and ventilation systems and early warning sensors.

All Prologis projects, Morgan said, meet strict national safety codes and none of the company’s facilities have ever had a fire.

Still, council members were not convinced.

“I’m sure there are a lot of advancements in battery safety,” Enegren said. “But a salesman always tells you that their deal is the best.”

“Prologis is disappointed by that decision,” Morgan wrote. “It is a missed opportunity.”

Sean Anderson, professor of environmental science and resource management, at CSU Channel Islands, said that although there are legitimate safety risks with the new, startup technology, the regulations have become more strict in response to the relatively rare fires.

“We need to validate people's fears and worries about that, but my fear is there are lot of problems we deal with all the time,” he said, referencing the local impacts of worsening climate change such as wildfires and poor air quality. “Staying on fossil fuels is actually way more dangerous. We need to be looking at the entirety of the risk profile, not just what this one dramatic visceral event looks like.”

Anderson cited the California Energy Commission, which declared that roughly 50 gigawatts of energy storage capacity is needed in the next two decades to meet clean energy goals. The current capacity is about 5 gigawatts.

He said that decisions like the one the city of Moorpark made hinders longer-term advancements in safety.

“The outright bans are concerning because they will lead to slower rollouts,” Anderson said. “It makes better sense to have more guardrails. There's a lot of quality we could bring to the systems.”

Prologis' project, however, has not completely been ruled out.

Assembly Bill 205, which Gov. Gavin Newsom signs into law in 2022, would allow Prologis to supersede local regulations by submitting its application to the California Energy Commission. The legislation would apply to large battery energy storage systems, which are an important aspect of the state’s push for renewable energy infrastructure,provided they meet the specific conditions.

“I don’t think it's right that one Assembly bill overrides the will of all the people,” Enegren said. “We can't do much about it. We have to work with it. It's an unfortunate thing to have happened.”

The company was officially established in 2020 after being spun out from LG Chem. By 2022, it was a publicly listed company on the Korea Stock Exchange.

That year, it also signed a joint venture with Hyundai to build a $4.3 billion EV battery manufacturing plant in Ellabell, Georgia.

That facility was at the center of an international incident earlier this month, but it was far from the last big money deal LGES has signed recently.

LG Energy Solution is now the third biggest EV supplier in the world

Just five years after its inception, LG Energy Solution has become the third largest EV supplier in the world behind global leader CATL and BYD, both from China.

LGES has signed billion-dollar deals with everyone from General Motors to Rivian.

LG Energy Solution partners:

General Motors: GM has a joint venture with LGES called Ultium Cells, which manufactures battery cells for GM's EVs.

Rivian: The U.S. EV maker signed a deal with LGES to be its battery supplier in 2024. LGES agreed to supply Rivian with 67 GWh of its new 4695-type cylindrical battery cells for five years.

Tesla: Tesla signed a $4.3 billion supply deal with LGES in July 2025. LGES will supply Tesla with lithium iron phosphate batteries sourced from its factory in Michigan, according to reports.

Mercedes-Benz AG: In September, LGES signed a $10.7 billion deal with Mercedes-Benz AG to build EV batteries for the company's vehicles in Europe and the U.S.

LG Energy Solution has numerous other partnerships to supply EV batteries in the U.S., and last week's Department of Homeland Security immigration raid could have put its plans to enter the country on hold.

Tuesday, the company assured the world that it would not abandon the U.S.

LG Energy Solution said Tuesday that it hasn't stopped construction of its plants in the U.S. despite the immigration raid on September 4 that rounded up 475 workers at its Ellabell plant.

More than 300 workers were Korean nationals who were reportedly ""all skilled workers,"" according to The Korea Times, and Hyundai CEO Jose Muñoz said that this could hurt the company's future plans in the country.

""For the construction phase of the plants, you need to get specialized people. There are a lot of skills and equipment that you cannot find in the United States,"" Muñoz said from the sidelines during an automotive conference in Detroit, according to Reuters.

But on Tuesday, LGES confirmed that it is not slowing down its U.S. ambitions.

“All of the locations are working very hard right now to assess and to make sure that we don’t have an impact on our customers,” Bob Lee, LGES' top executive in North America, said at an auto conference in Detroit Tuesday, the Wall Street Journal reported.

“We have to try to find a plan that works regardless of various, different scenarios, so that’s what we’re doing,” Lee said.

Lee hopes that LGES' misfortune will result in a positive development, allowing other Korean workers with technical skills to obtain visas more easily.

“That was something many people understood, but now, after this crisis, the fact that we’re placing attention on it will be a very good thing,” Lee said.

U.S. asked if detained Korean Hyundai workers could remain in the States

The DHS insisted that the immigration operation was ""about safeguarding the integrity of the economy and preventing the exploitation of workers.""

However, this week, President Donald Trump reportedly undermined the whole operation.

The deportation of 330 workers detained at the site was briefly delayed after the president encouraged them to remain in the U.S. and keep working.",https://www.thestreet.com/.image/ar_1.91%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MjE3ODAxNDc1ODU2ODAzNDMw/displays-at-south-korea-battery-expo.jpg,N,,2025-09-17 12:05:59.096729

On Tuesday (September 16) Energy Secretary Ed Miliband set out his vision for Great British Energy, detailing his expectations for how the UK’s publicly-owned clean power company will deliver on the government’s clean energy superpower mission – that will take back control of Britain’s energy supply to protect billpayers from global fossil fuel price spikes.

Great British Energy is already delivering savings to the British public at a local level, following its investment of around £200 million in solar and renewable energy projects on schools, hospitals and public buildings across the country, with solar panels already starting to cut bills for vital public services.

Under its objectives, the company will drive clean energy deployment across the whole of the UK, as a developer, investor, and owner of clean energy projects – working in tandem with the private sector, devolved governments, local authorities and community energy groups.

Throughout this, the company will be required to put working people and communities at the heart of the clean energy transition – by increasing public ownership and community involvement in the development of clean energy projects, and supporting jobs and economic growth across the UK.

The government has also now set a target for Great British Energy to start making returns on its commercial activities as a whole by 2030. This includes a requirement for the company to have a plan for becoming self-financing in place by 2030, with profits reinvested into clean energy projects that will help protect billpayers permanently.

The strategic priorities – agreed by all devolved governments – set a clear vision for how Great British Energy will provide a catalyst for the expansion of the UK’s homegrown, clean energy supply. It follows the passing of the Great British Energy Act in May.

Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said: “It is time to make things and own things in Britain again. That’s why we have set up Great British Energy to be a new national champion and allow us to reap the benefits of Britain’s abundant natural resources.

“Great British Energy will place working people, communities and British industries at its core, turbocharging clean energy across the country as part of our clean power mission.”

The government has today confirmed the three key areas that the company should focus on to meet these objectives, including:

Investment in and development of nascent and more established technologies and assets required for Clean Power 2030 and beyond;

Activity in domestic supply chains to build long-term domestic resilience and economic growth;

Supporting the growth of local and community energy, working alongside government to deliver a Local Power Plan that will help to ensure local people and communities benefit from the clean energy transition.

Great British Energy will produce a strategic plan within six months, setting out how it will meet the Energy Secretary’s expectations to support the clean power mission and deliver for the British public.

Great British Energy’s CEO, Dan McGrail said: “Work is already underway at Great British Energy to deliver our Strategic Plan, and we welcome the Secretary of State’s recommendations.

“Most of the clean energy projects in the Government’s’ Industrial Strategy will flow through Great British Energy, enabling us to be the green growth engine for the UK.

“We are going to invest £1 billion in domestic supply chains, which I expect will unlock billions more in investment and create thousands of jobs.

“Along with our partners like The National Wealth Fund, The Crown Estate, Great British Energy-Nuclear and many more, we are primed to develop innovative ways to grow new renewable technologies, ensuring our energy is engineered in the UK.”",https://herald.wales/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Stock-picture-solar-panels-Credit-Mark-Stebnicki-via-Pexels-e1738662768156.jpg,N,,2025-09-17 08:59:19.677780

The Treasury recently announced plans to offer the tax credit to companies that operate in the hydrogen production sector. That tax credit aims to build on the existing stance of the federal government and continues the work done by the previous administration. The Biden administration started the United States on a path to transitioning away from fossil fuels towards the more carbon-neutral forms of energy production that hydrogen offers.

The Treasury has finalized the requirements for the 45V program, as part of the Inflation Reduction Act

The Inflation Reduction Act was drafted and implemented in 2022, and it aims to offer a tax credit for hydrogen if the total greenhouse gas (GHG) generated in its production is less than or equal to 4 kg of carbon dioxide per 1 kg of hydrogen. That tax credit builds upon the federal government’s new approach to the energy sector, which has shifted between two administrations.

The final rules include a few significant changes to the existing rule structure, allowing for more flexibility and addressing several key factors that will allow the hydrogen sector in the United States to grow. In a rare state of partisan tranquility, the new rules have been embraced by both the federal government and environmental groups alike.

“These rules incorporate helpful feedback from companies planning investments which will drive significant deployment of clean hydrogen to power heavy industry and help create good-paying jobs. The Inflation Reduction Act and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law represent the world’s most ambitious policy support of the clean hydrogen industry. Scaling the production of low-carbon fuels like hydrogen will be a big boost to difficult-to-transition sectors of our economy like heavy industry.” – U.S. Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Wally Adeyemo

“Clean hydrogen can play a critical role decarbonizing multiple sectors across our economy, from industry to transportation, from energy storage to much more. The final rules announced today set us on a path to accelerate deployment of clean hydrogen, including at the Department of Energy’s clean Hydrogen Hubs, leading to new economic opportunities all across the country.” – U.S. Deputy Energy Secretary David M. Turk

Environmental groups have praised the new rule set as well

For hydrogen production using electricity (e.g., “green” hydrogen using renewables and “pink” hydrogen using nuclear), the new rules include building upon safeguards that were suggested in December 2023. For methane-based hydrogen, the rules propose enhancements in the accuracy of upstream methane leakage rates.

The new rules have been embraced by the industry as a whole as well as several environmental groups. The tax credit can be worth up to $3 per kilogram of hydrogen.

“We appreciate Treasury moving toward better hydrogen policy in its final rule for clean hydrogen production,” Conrad Schneider, a senior director at the Clean Air Task Force (CATF), an environmental group, says in a statement. “Hydrogen production must be decarbonized across the supply chain, 99% of which currently uses highly polluting fossil-fuel-based production.”

While Tesla has thousands of employees in California and Texas, some new electric vehicle plants have sputtered.","SOCIAL CIRCLE, Ga. (AP) — It seems like a terrible time to build an electric vehicle plant in the United States, but Rivian Automotive leaders say they’re confident as the company starts long-delayed work on a $5 billion facility in Georgia.

The money-losing California-based company broke ground Tuesday east of Atlanta despite President Donald Trump’s successful push to roll back electric vehicle tax credits. Starting Sept. 30, buyers will no longer qualify for savings of up to $7,500 per car.

CEO RJ Scaringe said Tuesday that Rivian will sell its R2 sport utility vehicles not for environmental or tax incentive reasons, but because it’s a superior vehicle.

“The description I’ll say for R2 is it isn’t an electric vehicle,” he said. “I describe R2 as an incredible five-passenger offroad machine. And it happens to be electric.”

Georgia plant is key to a mass market and profitability

The Georgia plant, first announced in 2021, is Rivian’s key to reaching profitability. Now the company makes the high-end R1T pickup truck and the R1S SUV in Normal, Illinois, as well as delivery vans for Amazon and others. Its truck prices start at $71,000.

The Illinois plant will begin making the smaller R2 next year, with prices starting at $45,000. An expanded Illinois plant will be able to assemble 215,000 vehicles yearly. But if the R2 is a hit, and if Rivian successfully produces an even smaller R3, it will need more capacity. Scaringe said the Georgia operation, able to make 200,000 vehicles yearly starting in 2028, is the “foundation for our growth.” Rivian plans another 200,000 in capacity in phase two, volume that would spread fixed costs over many more vehicles.

The projections would be a big leap from the 40,000 to 46,000 vehicles Rivian expects to deliver this year, down from 52,000 last year. The company says it’s limiting production in part to launch 2026 models.

“For Rivian, it’s do-or-die time,” said Alex Oyler, North American director of auto research firm SBD Automotive. “We saw with Tesla that the key to profitability is scale, and you can’t scale if your cheapest vehicle is $70,000. So they need that plant online to achieve a level of scale of R2 and ultimately R3.”

Challenges in the electric vehicle market

Sales growth is slowing for electric vehicles in the United States, rising only 1.5% in 2025’s first half, according to Cox Automotive.

Tesla accounted for almost 45% of U.S. electric vehicle sales in that period, according to Cox. But the giant is losing market share as others gain: General Motors’ slice of American EV sales has climbed to 13%. By comparison, Rivian had a 3% share in the first half of the year, behind Tesla and six traditional automakers.

But excluding Tesla, Rivian is the most successful startup automaker.

The company initially tapped a largely unfilled niche: demand for electric pickups and SUVs. But competition now includes Ford’s F-150 Lightning and the electric Chevrolet Silverado.

After an initial public offering in 2021, Rivian shares have fallen by more than 80%, while automaker shares overall have outpaced the broader stock market. Rivian lost $1.66 billion in 2025’s first half.

At the same time, some automakers’ ardor for electric vehicles is cooling. Stellantis last week canceled Ram’s electric truck program. Ford has delayed production at a new Tennessee plant. And General Motors abandoned plans to build electric vehicles in suburban Detroit.

“With all the competition out there in this market and the slowing growth of EVs, it does not play in Rivian’s favor,” said Sam Fiorani, a vice president at AutoForecast Solutions. “However, there still is an EV market out there.”

$1.5 billion in incentives for 7,500 jobs

Georgia has pledged $1.5 billion of incentives to Rivian in exchange for 7,500 company jobs paying at least $56,000 a year on average. Rivian can’t benefit from most incentives unless it meets employment goals, but the state is already spending $175 million to buy and grade land and improve roads.

Georgia Republican Gov. Brian Kemp, says he wants to make Georgia “the electric mobility capital of America,” but acknowledged Tuesday that “the road to get here has not been smooth.” He voiced confidence that Rivian can deliver “an innovation revolution” benefitting Georgians.

While Tesla has thousands of employees in California and Texas, some new electric vehicle plants have sputtered. Two separate EV makers that hoped to assemble vehicles in a former GM plant in Lordstown, Ohio, went bankrupt. Georgia’s Hyundai complex near Savannah is faring better, with production underway. However, a battery plant there has been delayed by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement arresting 475 people on site, including more than 300 South Koreans.

Rivian was supposed to be making trucks by now at the 2,000-acre (800-hectare) site near Social Circle, about 45 miles (70 kilometers) east of Atlanta. As the company burned through cash in 2024, it paused construction. But German automaker Volkswagen agreed to invest $5.8 billion in Rivian in exchange for software and electrical technology. And then-President Joe Biden’s administration agreed to loan Rivian $6.6 billion to build the Georgia plant.

Despite the Trump administration’s hostility toward EVs, Scaringe said Tuesday that Rivian has built “a very close relationship” with the U.S. Department of Energy and that the company’s goals align with some of Trump’s big ones, including “U.S. manufacturing, U.S. technology, U.S. technology that supports global business, and leading in all those areas.”

Kemp said he has urged Energy Secretary Chris Wright to back Rivian.

Some neighbors still oppose the plant

Rivian also faces opposition from some residents who say the plant is an inappropriate neighbor to farms and will pollute the groundwater.

“I planned on dying and retiring on the front porch and the biggest project in Georgia has to go next door to me, of all places in the country?” asked Eddie Clay, who lives less than a mile away. He says his well water turned mud-choked after excavation at the Rivian site.

There are other challenges for Rivian, including tariffs costing $2,000 per vehicle, the Trump administration ending a tax-credit program that will cost the company $140 million in revenue this year, and long-term threats from low-priced, cutting-edge Chinese EVs. But Scaringe said the start of construction shows Rivian is working through its challenges.

“These are not the kinds of things you start without having clear sight to be able to fully finish and launch,” he said.

The Guardian has long been at the forefront of agenda-setting climate journalism, and in a news cycle dominated by autocrats and war, we refuse to let the health of the planet slip out of sight.

We stand out as a media organisation by examining why the climate emergency is creating a new era of demagogues and how powerful governments, financial institutions and big oil companies are turning their back on climate promises.

The Guardian has tracked how the Trump administration is defunding world-leading climate research agencies, firing droves of scientists and blocking access to cutting-edge information about climate trends. We published the US National Climate Report in full to ensure it can be found, for free, in the public domain.

Guardian reporters are investigating how money from climate deniers and fossil fuel interests is funding thinktanks linked to far-right groups in Britain and Europe. This is a clear attempt to break down the longstanding consensus over climate science and net zero campaigns.

Our reporters hold the corporate enablers of fossil fuel interests to account: from the public affairs firms lobbying on their behalf to water down climate policy to the banks financing “carbon bomb” projects that will blow through the dwindling carbon budget.

In these bleak times, it is also crucial to report on the strength of the resistance and the possibility for positive change: the leaders still seeking global solutions, the youth activists who have launched a new campaign to “villainise big oil”, the taskforce dreaming up radical climate solutions and the campaigns that remind us that the overwhelming majority of people in the world want more ambitious climate action.

2. We will report on how climate breakdown is already affecting people, the natural world and other species, as well as what to do about it

Over the past year, alongside our daily reporting on climate impacts and extreme weather events, several new series shone a light on the people whose lives are being directly altered by the climate crisis, and the solutions people are creating in their own homes and communities.

For This is climate breakdown our reporters worked alongside researchers and humanitarian workers at the Climate Disaster Project in Canada and the International Red Cross to compile a series of testimonies from survivors of recent extreme weather events.

My DIY climate hack shared inspiring examples from readers who are creating their own solutions to the environmental challenges they face – inspiring individuals who have turned their gardens into micro-farms, started free clothing swaps, organised low-waste weddings, invented energy-saving gadgets and more.

Our ongoing Alternatives series highlighted the local communities and political parties coming up with low-carbon ways of living that might actually scale.

And our one-of-a-kind survey highlighted the fears and concerns of hundreds of the world’s leading scientists, and their views on the most powerful climate actions you can take.

As climate records continue to be broken, we reported on new data that illustrates how planetary conditions are changing rapidly:

2024 was the hottest year on record, driving the annual global temperature above the internationally agreed 1.5C target for the first time

Winter temperatures at the north pole reached more than 20C above the 1991-2020 average in early 2025, crossing the threshold for ice to melt

The planet’s remaining carbon budget to meet the international target of 1.5C has just two years left at the current rate of emissions

Humans are driving biodiversity loss among all species across the planet, according to the largest syntheses of the human impacts on biodiversity ever conducted worldwide

Tipping points – in the Amazon, Antarctic, coral reefs and more – could cause fundamental parts of the Earth’s system to change dramatically, irreversibly and with devastating effects. We asked the experts about the latest science – and how it makes them feel

4. The Guardian will eliminate two-thirds of its emissions by 2030 and reduce our impact on nature

Since 2020, our company greenhouse gas emissions have reduced by 48%, putting us well on track to achieve our target of a 67% reduction by 2030. In the last reporting year, emissions fell by 9%.

The biggest reductions so far in our plan have come from our print business, which now accounts for 64% of our total footprint, compared with 73% in 2020. As our business becomes more digital and more global, emissions from our digital products, IT operations and business travel will account for a larger proportion of emissions.

We are committed to reducing all areas of our footprint, which is why we have developed a bespoke climate literacy course for our staff to empower all colleagues to take action in their area of the business.

5. We will seek to decouple our business and finances from fossil-fuel extractive companies

The Guardian has refused advertising from all fossil-fuel extractive companies since January 2020.

The Guardian is supported by the Scott Trust and the returns from its endowment fund. The fund’s environmental strategy is focused on contributing to a reduction of emissions in the real world and to protecting nature and biodiversity. The fund has made significant investments in environmental solutions, with more than £100m now invested in areas ranging from cutting emissions in manufacturing processes to increasing the resilience of food systems in a warming world. Additionally, the fund has made a commitment to invest at least 3% of its value in natural capital and biodiversity solutions.

The endowment’s environmental focus builds on work started in 2015 to divest from fossil fuels.

6. We will be transparent with our progress

We believe transparency is the key to tackling the climate crisis. By sharing our data, our successes and our challenges, we can be part of the global movement to make businesses accountable for their climate and nature impacts.

In the past year we have:

Published our annual company emissions data, explaining what drives our emissions and where they have risen and fallen

Created a digital course, as part of an initiative by the Sustainable Journalism Partnership, sharing examples from experts across the Guardian of how to embed sustainability into journalism and media commercial operations

While Tesla has thousands of employees in California and Texas, some new electric vehicle plants have sputtered.","SOCIAL CIRCLE, Ga. (AP) — It seems like a terrible time to build an electric vehicle plant in the United States, but Rivian Automotive leaders say they’re confident as the company starts long-delayed work on a $5 billion facility in Georgia.

The money-losing California-based company broke ground Tuesday east of Atlanta despite President Donald Trump’s successful push to roll back electric vehicle tax credits. Starting Sept. 30, buyers will no longer qualify for savings of up to $7,500 per car.

CEO RJ Scaringe said Tuesday that Rivian will sell its R2 sport utility vehicles not for environmental or tax incentive reasons, but because it’s a superior vehicle.

“The description I’ll say for R2 is it isn’t an electric vehicle,” he said. “I describe R2 as an incredible five-passenger offroad machine. And it happens to be electric.”

Georgia plant is key to a mass market and profitability

The Georgia plant, first announced in 2021, is Rivian’s key to reaching profitability. Now the company makes the high-end R1T pickup truck and the R1S SUV in Normal, Illinois, as well as delivery vans for Amazon and others. Its truck prices start at $71,000.

The Illinois plant will begin making the smaller R2 next year, with prices starting at $45,000. An expanded Illinois plant will be able to assemble 215,000 vehicles yearly. But if the R2 is a hit, and if Rivian successfully produces an even smaller R3, it will need more capacity. Scaringe said the Georgia operation, able to make 200,000 vehicles yearly starting in 2028, is the “foundation for our growth.” Rivian plans another 200,000 in capacity in phase two, volume that would spread fixed costs over many more vehicles.

The projections would be a big leap from the 40,000 to 46,000 vehicles Rivian expects to deliver this year, down from 52,000 last year. The company says it’s limiting production in part to launch 2026 models.

“For Rivian, it’s do-or-die time,” said Alex Oyler, North American director of auto research firm SBD Automotive. “We saw with Tesla that the key to profitability is scale, and you can’t scale if your cheapest vehicle is $70,000. So they need that plant online to achieve a level of scale of R2 and ultimately R3.”

Challenges in the electric vehicle market

Sales growth is slowing for electric vehicles in the United States, rising only 1.5% in 2025’s first half, according to Cox Automotive.

Tesla accounted for almost 45% of U.S. electric vehicle sales in that period, according to Cox. But the giant is losing market share as others gain: General Motors’ slice of American EV sales has climbed to 13%. By comparison, Rivian had a 3% share in the first half of the year, behind Tesla and six traditional automakers.

But excluding Tesla, Rivian is the most successful startup automaker.

The company initially tapped a largely unfilled niche: demand for electric pickups and SUVs. But competition now includes Ford’s F-150 Lightning and the electric Chevrolet Silverado.

After an initial public offering in 2021, Rivian shares have fallen by more than 80%, while automaker shares overall have outpaced the broader stock market. Rivian lost $1.66 billion in 2025’s first half.

At the same time, some automakers’ ardor for electric vehicles is cooling. Stellantis last week canceled Ram’s electric truck program. Ford has delayed production at a new Tennessee plant. And General Motors abandoned plans to build electric vehicles in suburban Detroit.

“With all the competition out there in this market and the slowing growth of EVs, it does not play in Rivian’s favor,” said Sam Fiorani, a vice president at AutoForecast Solutions. “However, there still is an EV market out there.”

$1.5 billion in incentives for 7,500 jobs

Georgia has pledged $1.5 billion of incentives to Rivian in exchange for 7,500 company jobs paying at least $56,000 a year on average. Rivian can’t benefit from most incentives unless it meets employment goals, but the state is already spending $175 million to buy and grade land and improve roads.

Georgia Republican Gov. Brian Kemp, says he wants to make Georgia “the electric mobility capital of America,” but acknowledged Tuesday that “the road to get here has not been smooth.” He voiced confidence that Rivian can deliver “an innovation revolution” benefitting Georgians.

While Tesla has thousands of employees in California and Texas, some new electric vehicle plants have sputtered. Two separate EV makers that hoped to assemble vehicles in a former GM plant in Lordstown, Ohio, went bankrupt. Georgia’s Hyundai complex near Savannah is faring better, with production underway. However, a battery plant there has been delayed by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement arresting 475 people on site, including more than 300 South Koreans.

Rivian was supposed to be making trucks by now at the 2,000-acre (800-hectare) site near Social Circle, about 45 miles (70 kilometers) east of Atlanta. As the company burned through cash in 2024, it paused construction. But German automaker Volkswagen agreed to invest $5.8 billion in Rivian in exchange for software and electrical technology. And then-President Joe Biden’s administration agreed to loan Rivian $6.6 billion to build the Georgia plant.

Kemp said he has urged Energy Secretary Chris Wright to back Rivian.

Rivian also faces opposition from some residents who say the plant is an inappropriate neighbor to farms and will pollute the groundwater.

“I planned on dying and retiring on the front porch and the biggest project in Georgia has to go next door to me, of all places in the country?” asked Eddie Clay, who lives less than a mile away. He says his well water turned mud-choked after excavation at the Rivian site.

There are other challenges for Rivian, including tariffs costing $2,000 per vehicle, the Trump administration ending a tax-credit program that will cost the company $140 million in revenue this year, and long-term threats from low-priced, cutting-edge Chinese EVs. But Scaringe said the start of construction shows Rivian is working through its challenges.

“These are not the kinds of things you start without having clear sight to be able to fully finish and launch,” he said.

The agreement announced in June is just the latest in a string of tech-nuclear partnerships as the use of AI expands. Financial details of the agreement were not disclosed.

Constellation’s Clinton Clean Energy Center was actually slated to close in 2017 after years of financial losses, but was saved by legislation in Illinois establishing a zero-emission credit program to support the plant into 2027. The agreement deal takes effect in June of 2027, when the state’s taxpayer-funded zero-emission credit program expires.

With the arrival of Meta, Clinton’s clean energy output will expand by 30 megawatts, preserve 1,100 local jobs, and bring in $13.5 million in annual tax revenue, according to the companies. The plant currently powers the equivalent of about 800,000 U.S. homes. George Gross, professor of electrical and computer engineering at the University of Illinois, estimates that 30 additional megawatts would be enough to power a city with about 30,00 residents for one year.

“Securing clean, reliable energy is necessary to continue advancing our AI ambitions,” said Urvi Parekh, Meta’s head of global energy.

Surging investments in small nuclear reactors comes at a time when large tech companies are facing two major demands: a need to increase their energy supply for AI and data centers, among other needs, while also trying to meet their long-term goals to significantly cut greenhouse gas emissions.

Constellation, the owner of the shuttered Three Mile Island nuclear power plant, said in September that it planned to restart the reactor so tech giant Microsoft could secure power to supply its data centers. Three Mile Island, located on the Susquehanna River just outside Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, was the site of the nation’s worst commercial nuclear power accident in 1979.

Also last fall, Amazon said it was investing in small nuclear reactors, two days after a similar announcement by Google. Additionally, Google announced in May that it was investing in three advanced nuclear energy projects with Elementl Power.

U.S. states have been positioning themselves to meet the tech industry’s power needs as policymakers consider expanding subsidies and gutting regulatory obstacles.

Last year, 25 states passed legislation to support advanced nuclear energy, and lawmakers this year have introduced over 200 bills supportive of nuclear energy, according to the trade association Nuclear Energy Institute.

Advanced reactor designs from competing firms are filling up the federal government’s regulatory pipeline as the industry touts them as a reliable, climate-friendly way to meet electricity demands from tech giants desperate to power their fast-growing artificial intelligence platforms.

Still, it is unlikely the U.S. could quadruple its nuclear production within the next 25 years, like the White House wants. The United States lacks any next-generation reactors operating commercially and only two new large reactors have been built from scratch in nearly 50 years. Those two reactors, at a nuclear plant in Georgia, were completed years late and at least $17 billion over budget.

Additionally, Gross recommends that the U.S. invest more in the transmission grid that moves that power around.

“That’s my biggest concern,” Gross said, adding that spending on the grid has actually fallen off in recent years, despite the voracious demand for energy.

Amazon, Google, and Microsoft also have been investing in solar and wind technologies, which make electricity without producing greenhouse gas emissions.",http://www.milwaukeeindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/060425_MetaAINukePower_01_JohnDixon.jpg,N,,2025-09-17 08:59:27.579845

One of the most consequential legislative acts of President Donald Trump’s second administration thus far has been his July 4 signing of the “One Big Beautiful Bill” Act (OBBBA) into law. The OBBBA will set the spending policies and tax agenda for the remainder of Trump’s second term, permanently extending many of the tax rates of Trump’s 2017 tax bill, as well as making numerous cuts to spending elsewhere.

Perhaps the most controversial spending cut in the OBBBA is the 12% decrease in Medicaid spending; however, overshadowed by that contentious elimination is the fact that the OBBBA will eliminate the electric vehicle (EV) tax credit by the end of September 2025.

What Is the EV Tax Credit?

The EV tax credit was part of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022. The IRA was meant to incentivize buyers to purchase environmentally-friendly EVs by providing them with a $7,500 tax credit when purchasing a qualifying new EV. The OBBBA will bring an end to that credit.

It now appears, though, that the OBBBA contains a loophole that allows EV buyers to claim an EV tax credit beyond the September 30 deadline set by the bill.

How To Keep the EV Tax Credit Beyond September

As reported by Yahoo Finance, auto manufacturers interpreted the wording of the OBBBA was such that the contract to purchase of an EV must be signed — and the EV must be delivered — all by September 30 in order for the tax credit to be claimed buy the purchaser. However, the IRS (and its interpretation of the new law) has created something of a loophole within the OBBBA’s wording to extend that deadline for EV buyers.

The IRS has specified that “if a taxpayer acquires a vehicle by having a written binding contract in place and a payment made on or before September 30, 2025, then the taxpayer will be entitled to claim the credit when they place the vehicle in service (namely, when they take possession of the vehicle), even if the vehicle is placed in service after September 30, 2025.”

What’s that mean without the legalese? Essentially, as long as an EV buyer has signed a purchase contract and either paid a deposit or the full purchase amount by or before September 30, that buyer is entitled to the EV tax credit, even if the vehicle isn’t in their possession by that date.

While the deadline still remains, this loophole does allow purchasers a slight amount of wiggle room. As long as you’re willing to sign on the dotted line (and pay a deposit) prior to September 30, the $7,500 EV tax credit is still available to you if you act fast.",https://cdn.gobankingrates.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/electric-vehicle-shutterstock_1082414501.jpg,N,,2025-09-17 09:00:07.434600

This is the same professional geothermal engineering firm that developed The Geysers, the largest complex of geothermal energy facilities in the world.
Aside from Tongonan, EDC owns seven other geothermal power stations operating across the Philippines, bringing total generating capacity to over 1,100 MW.","It seeks to boost efficiency and sustainability and extend plant life.

Energy Development Corp. (EDC) is planning major upgrades to its geothermal power facilities in Leyte, Philippines, inspired by the technology used in The Geysers geothermal plants in California.

The initiative aims to improve efficiency, extend plant life, and ensure sustainable operations. The upgrades will be based on benchmarking initiatives with American energy company Calpine Corp.

“We will install a wellhead washing system, rock catcher, steam washing, and an additional demister,” Teodulfo Troyo, head of EDC’s Leyte site, told Asian Power. Combined, these deliver purified, high-quality steam that removes impurities and helps ensure efficient and reliable operation of the steam turbines.

A subsidiary of First Gen Corporation, EDC operates three geothermal plants in the Tongonan Geothermal field--the Tongonan, Malitbog and Upper Mahiao facilities. The upgrades will focus on the steamfield facilities that supply energy to all three plants.

Straddling Kananga and Ormoc in Leyte, the Tongonan geothermal field comprises 31 production wells and nine reinjection wells and spans more than 107,000 hectares of protected forest land.

International geothermal consulting firm Veizades & Associates, Inc. will plan the upgrades. This is the same professional geothermal engineering firm that developed The Geysers, the largest complex of geothermal energy facilities in the world.

Troyo said the firm has started collecting data, with final designs and cost estimates to follow. He added the design phase would take at least six months, followed by construction or equipment replacement over two to three years.

EDC is also exploring new technologies such as electrical submersible pumps to revitalise older wells and modular binary plants that don’t require extensive steam piping.

“These are still in the planning stage, but since they are already used abroad, we hope to replicate similar success,” Troyo said, citing the potential to add 10 megawatts (MW) to 15 MW without heavy infrastructure costs.

Turbines and generator rotors in Tongonan’s facilities have been replaced, and operations are now nearly fully automated. “Operations now focus on optimising and monitoring the plant, with less manual adjustment,” Troyo said.

Plans are also underway to replace nine cooling towers with new units that are resilient to typhoons and earthquakes.

With these upgrades, EDC expects Tongonan to remain operational until at least 2046.

Meanwhile, the firm’s other geothermal facilities are also due for rehabilitation and upgrades over the near term. The 180 MW Mahanagdong facilities will undergo rehabilitation and capacity upgrades in three to five years, whilst Upper Mahiao is slated for complete plant replacement to boost generating capacity from 130 MW to at least 200 MW, supported by additional geothermal wells.

Aside from Tongonan, EDC owns seven other geothermal power stations operating across the Philippines, bringing total generating capacity to over 1,100 MW.",https://www.cmgassets.com/s3fs-public/styles/opengraph/public/2025-09/tongonan-geothermal-power-plant-1-1.jpg?h=b7b9e179&itok=l8IvjWF4,N,,2025-09-17 06:58:44.825672

The OBBBA will set the spending policies and tax agenda for the remainder of Trump’s second term, permanently extending many of the tax rates of Trump’s 2017 tax bill, as well as making numerous cuts to spending elsewhere.

Perhaps the most controversial spending cut in the OBBBA is the 12% decrease in Medicaid spending; however, overshadowed by that contentious elimination is the fact that the OBBBA will eliminate the electric vehicle (EV) tax credit by the end of September 2025.

What Is the EV Tax Credit?

The EV tax credit was part of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022. The IRA was meant to incentivize buyers to purchase environmentally-friendly EVs by providing them with a $7,500 tax credit when purchasing a qualifying new EV. The OBBBA will bring an end to that credit.

It now appears, though, that the OBBBA contains a loophole that allows EV buyers to claim an EV tax credit beyond the September 30 deadline set by the bill.

How To Keep the EV Tax Credit Beyond September

As reported by Yahoo Finance, auto manufacturers interpreted the wording of the OBBBA was such that the contract to purchase of an EV must be signed — and the EV must be delivered — all by September 30 in order for the tax credit to be claimed buy the purchaser. However, the IRS (and its interpretation of the new law) has created something of a loophole within the OBBBA’s wording to extend that deadline for EV buyers.

The IRS has specified that “if a taxpayer acquires a vehicle by having a written binding contract in place and a payment made on or before September 30, 2025, then the taxpayer will be entitled to claim the credit when they place the vehicle in service (namely, when they take possession of the vehicle), even if the vehicle is placed in service after September 30, 2025.”

What’s that mean without the legalese? Essentially, as long as an EV buyer has signed a purchase contract and either paid a deposit or the full purchase amount by or before September 30, that buyer is entitled to the EV tax credit, even if the vehicle isn’t in their possession by that date.

While the deadline still remains, this loophole does allow purchasers a slight amount of wiggle room.

Net profit attributable to shareholders also increased jumping from 3.6 billion yuan to 5.3 billion yuan.","Inner Mongolia Dian Tou Energy Corporation Limited, also known as IMDTECL, has successfully transitioned from a traditional energy enterprise to a clean energy provider in just a few years' time.

The company saw its renewable energy capacity reach around 5 million kilowatts in 2024, accounting for over 62 percent of its total installed capacity, Zhao Changyu, head of the company's new energy department, said.

IMDTECL, the sole listed financing platform of State Power Investment Corporation (SPIC) in the Inner Mongolia autonomous region, has strategically shifted its focus towards green energy during China's 14th Five-Year Plan period (2021-2025), aligning with the nation's energy security and dual carbon goals.

The company has built a diversified energy industry system with coal, thermal power, new energy, and electrolytic aluminum as its business cornerstones. It boasts an annual coal production capacity of 48 million tons, 3 million kilowatts of thermal power capacity, around five million kilowatts of new energy capacity, and 860,000 tons of electrolytic aluminum capacity.

Additionally, IMDTECL has built a ""coal-new energy-electricity-aluminum"" circular economy model, utilizing low-quality coal for power generation and green electricity for electrolytic aluminum production.

Cementing its commitment to clean energy, IMDTECL has invested in manufacturing and technology innovation to promote clean, green, low-carbon, and intelligent operations across its industrial chain.

Shifts in IMDTECL's production processes — such as using unmanned mining trucks and automation systems in its electrolytic aluminum production —have reduced emissions and improved efficiency.

The changes position the company favorably in a market increasingly focused on sustainability, Lin Boqiang, head of the China Institute for Studies in Energy Policy at Xiamen University, said.

The trend of unmanned mining trucks and automation systems is transforming the mining industry, driving greater efficiency, safety, and sustainability, he said.

IMDTECL has been optimizing its industrial structure and embracing low-carbon initiatives in recent years. As a result, its assets have grown from 34.5 billion yuan ($4.83 billion) to 55 billion yuan, with owner's equity increasing from 20.6 billion yuan to 40 billion yuan.

""Energy broadly and clean energy are a massive economic market opportunity and obligation,"" Grumet said.
The latest Renewable Energy Investment Tracker report from strategic research provider BloombergNEF indicates that a shift in clean energy investment away from the U.S. is already underway.","This summer, officials with the China Green Development Group showcased a sprawling solar park nearing completion in the country's Xinjiang region that covers more than 230 square miles of the Gobi Desert, an area roughly the size of Chicago. The Midong solar project is the world's largest single-solar power producer, potentially generating enough electricity for 5 million households.

In October, China's Dongfang Electric Wind Power Co. announced that the world's largest wind turbine had rolled off the production line at southern China's Fujian Fuzhou Offshore Wind Power Industrial Park.

According to Dongfang, the behemoth structure will be able to power 55,000 households at peak output and its central hub will stand 606 feet high—roughly twice as tall as the Statue of Liberty.

Chinese automaker BYD is nearing completion of a city-sized electric vehicle and battery manufacturing center in Zhengzhou, in China's Henan province, that will be roughly 10 times the size of Tesla's largest U.S. facility.

The expansive EV factories, towering wind turbines and sprawling solar arrays are symbols of China's enormous global lead in renewable energy and clean technology, some of the fastest growing sectors of the global energy market.

""I would describe the gap in terms of competitiveness between Chinese companies and their U.S. counterparts like an NBA game,"" Li Shuo, director of the China Climate Hub at the D.C.-based think tank Asia Society Policy Institute told Newsweek. ""We're in the fourth quarter and the U.S. team is trailing by 30 points.""

President Donald Trump talks about ""U.S. energy dominance"" while advancing policies to prop up the collapsing market for coal and drill more oil and gas—the leading energy sources of the 20th century. But Chinese President Xi Jinping is showing what it looks like to dominate the energy of the 21st century.

By most estimates, Li said, China controls more than half of global EV manufacturing, 70 percent of wind turbine production and 80 percent of PV solar panel production.

""That dominating position was established by thorough, savvy and consistent policy frameworks in China,"" Li explained. China has leveraged its enormous domestic market to provide demand for clean energy, while it steadily developed an industrial ecosystem to innovate along supply chains and lower costs for clean tech products and renewable energy.

""That kind of secret sauce, if you will, that China has simply does not exist here in the U.S.,"" Li said.

Change in Strategy

The U.S. energy story, by contrast, has been one of whipsaw swings in policy with each change in party control of Congress and the White House.

President Joe Biden's 2022 Inflation Reduction Act—passed solely with Democratic votes in Congress—provided historic incentives for clean energy manufacturers and EV and battery makers. The bill's tax incentives and government-supported loans triggered hundreds of billions of dollars of private investment. The law and related federal programs aimed to boost demand for EVs and clean energy while building up a domestic supply chain so that clean technology made in the U.S. could better compete with that made in China.

""We were effectively fighting back and succeeding over the last several years,"" Jason Grumet, CEO of the trade group American Clean Power, told Newsweek.

The U.S. now has about 200 primary clean energy manufacturing facilities, Grumet said, and has been adding dozens of new ones each year. Grumet described a growing energy sector ""on the verge of becoming basically self-sufficient"" for making final products like solar panels and wind turbines, and developing the capacity to make the components domestically as well.

As demand for electricity surged to power more electric devices in homes and Big Tech's boom in data centers, renewable energy has been the go-to source for the cheapest, fastest way to generate more juice. The federal Energy Information Administration said that roughly 90 percent of new electricity capacity added to the U.S. grid last year came from a combination of solar, wind and battery storage.

But all of that is changing now. President Trump took office with a pledge to undo what he called the ""green new scam"" of clean energy policies and instead focus on the ""black gold"" beneath our feet.

Trump's signature legislative achievement, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, that he signed into law on July 4, ends most of the Biden-era supports for clean technology and renewable energy, and his cabinet officials in energy and environmental agencies have gutted grant and loan programs for clean energy.

Grumet said the clean energy industry was prepared to deal with Congress's phase out of tax subsidies.

""We were prepared to have a future in which the production of these electrons was not receiving government support,"" he said. ""These technologies are ready to compete.""

However, he said, the administration has also engaged in a much broader assault on clean energy through a range of executive actions further restricting access to remaining tax credits, halting offshore wind projects that are near completion and blocking renewable energy projects on public lands.

""At a time when energy demand is growing, it is mind boggling that a federal government would be actively betting against American companies and American energy technologies,"" Grumet said. And the raft of executive orders has thrown plans for clean energy investment into chaos. The pipeline of new projects has now ""frozen"" he said, and clean power purchase agreements have dropped by about a third.

The net result, Grumet said, will be higher energy prices for consumers, fewer jobs in clean tech manufacturing and a greatly reduced ability to compete globally.

""It's surprising to me that in a country where we see competition with China as such a significant policy driver, we would wave a white flag when we were on the verge of really making progress,"" he said.

The U.S. retreat from clean energy and China's massive push into the rapidly growing sector will have enormous implications for the world's energy outlook and global efforts to address climate change.

Power of the Future

A spokesperson for the Department of Energy told Newsweek via email that administration policies reflect the country's overwhelming reliance on fossil fuels for the combined energy needed for transportation, industry and electrical generation. Wind, solar and batteries provided only about 3 percent of total primary energy consumption last year, the spokesperson said.

""The One Big Beautiful Bill prioritizes baseload power by maintaining credits that help build more baseload generation and ends subsidies for intermittent power sources that make the grid less reliable and drive up energy prices,"" the DOE spokesperson said.

""While the previous administration pursued a strategy of energy subtraction that imposed higher costs on American families and made our grids less reliable, President Trump's administration is advancing a strategy of energy addition and common sense—leveraging all forms of energy that are affordable, reliable, and secure to ensure the United States is able to win the AI race and reindustrialize.""

The spokesperson did not respond to a question about U.S. competition with China on clean energy.

Nobel prize-winning scientist Steven Chu, energy secretary during President Barack Obama's first term, was fond of citing an old adage from hockey: ""Skate to where the puck is going to be, not where it has been.""

Energy policies rooted in the traditional use of fossil fuels cover where the puck has been. But data on global energy investment show strong trend lines pointing to where the puck is going, and it is going toward cleaner electric power.

In its latest report on worldwide energy investment, the International Energy Agency found that this year around $2.2 trillion is going collectively to ""renewables, nuclear, grids, storage, low-emissions fuels, efficiency and electrification."" That's twice as much as the $1.1 trillion going to oil, natural gas and coal.

The IEA noted that the rapid growth in spending on a clean energy transition over the past five years was partly due to climate concerns but primarily driven by countries that wanted to improve their energy security. Europe accelerated spending on renewables and energy efficiency after Russia's invasion of Ukraine disrupted natural gas supplies. China—the world's largest oil importer—worked to reduce its reliance on oil and gas imports and ""exert leadership in new technology areas,"" the IEA said.

With low-carbon energy and electrification investments doubling those in fossil fuels, clean energy is looking like the global growth market in energy. ""Energy broadly and clean energy are a massive economic market opportunity and obligation,"" Grumet said. ""There's a tremendous market for new energy.""

Several leaders of venture capital firms that specialize in clean tech and renewable energy told Newsweek that one effect of Trump's energy policy will be to drive investment that would have flowed to the U.S. to other countries with friendlier political environments instead.

Daniel Weiss, co-founder and managing partner of Angeleno Group, a Los Angeles-based venture capital and growth equity investment firm, said that while the U.S. outlook is rocky, ""global tailwinds are largely intact"" for clean tech as many countries remain committed to an energy transition.

""Nearly 80 percent of the world has sent a signal to capital markets, to investors that we're on a long-term trajectory moving from a low-efficiency, high-carbon world to a higher-efficiency, low-carbon world,"" Weiss told Newsweek earlier this year.

Rob Day, co-founder of the Boston-based firm Spring Lane Capital, said the rest of the world will be ""stealing a march"" on the U.S. by attracting investment in clean energy. ""The U.S. is absolutely going to lose its leadership position on all of these technologies and solutions of tomorrow,"" Day told Newsweek in an interview in summer. ""And it's a crying shame.""

The latest Renewable Energy Investment Tracker report from strategic research provider BloombergNEF indicates that a shift in clean energy investment away from the U.S. is already underway. BloombergNEF found that global investment in new clean energy hit a record $386 billion in the first half of this year, a 10 percent increase from 2024. However, of all the major regions, ""the U.S. saw the greatest drop in new renewable energy investment.""

Committed spending on U.S. renewable energy was down $20.5 billion, more than a third lower than in the previous six months as ""investors recalibrate to the region's changing policy landscape,"" the report said.

Climate Matters

Spend any time talking to people in the U.S. clean energy sector and you will likely hear that China is ""eating our lunch.""

Author and climate activist Bill McKibben takes that saying a step further. ""We've sent a team of red-capped waiters to China to serve the lunch for them,"" he told Newsweek in a recent interview about his latest book, Here Comes the Sun, which explains the implications of the rapid growth and plummeting costs of solar power.

The U.S. invented solar power, but we've now ceded the solar future to China, he said, in favor of a return to fossil fuels. ""If the Trump guys have their way, 15 years from now, America's going to be like a Colonial Williamsburg of internal combustion, where the rest of the world comes to gawk at how people used to live in the olden days,"" McKibben said.

McKibben added that he's conflicted. As an American, he finds it ""galling and frustrating"" to see China capitalize on technology Americans developed. But as a climate organizer and global citizen, he knows that China's booming growth in renewable energy and its flood of solar panel exports creates a rare opportunity for climate action.

A report in August from the clean energy think tank Ember found that Chinese exports of solar panels to African countries rose 60 percent in the last year, presenting a ""vast potential to transform the African continent."" Twenty African countries set new records for the imports of solar panels in the past year.

In his book, McKibben relays Pakistan's rapid adoption of solar, again, thanks to Chinese-made PV panels.

As China seizes the solar moment, ""they're going to seize a lot of political high ground,"" he said.

""I don't particularly like the Chinese government,"" McKibben said. As an outspoken journalist and activist, he said he'd probably be jailed in China.

But with the U.S. withdrawing from the Paris climate agreement and the Trump administration issuing reports that deny or downplay climate change, China is now likely to dominate the global climate process going forward.

""And my guess is the Chinese will use it as their ticket to global legitimacy,"" McKibben added.

United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres said in a special address in July that the world is at ""the dawn of a new energy era"" of cheap, clean power that creates an opportunity to meet the climate challenge.

He urged nations to make more ambitious climate pledges at a high-level event he was hosting when the UN General Assembly convened in New York earlier this month.

Li Shuo of the Asia Society Policy Institute said he anticipates China will gradually ramp up its climate commitments.

""Of course, the U.S. being the most powerful country in the world, putting its weight on the fossil fuel side, that is not good news for the global climate agenda,"" Li said. ""We just need to find a way for the U.S. to hopefully pivot back to the clean tech transition.""

Part of the path forward, Li said, must include reducing the partisan politics around the U.S. energy discussion.

Ilaria Mazzocco is deputy director and senior fellow with the Trustee Chair in Chinese Business and Economics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, where she focuses on China's energy supply chains.

""What I think ties the hands of the United States is that energy policy is so partisan and so politicized,"" Mazzocco told Newsweek. ""It surprises sometimes policy makers when I point out that in China there really is zero ideological partisanship tied to the electrification of the energy system and cars.""

The U.S. energy debate is so tied up in campaign cash and culture wars that power derived from a fossil fuel is viewed as conservative, while energy from a wind turbine is liberal—an Electoral College sorting of electrons.

American Clean Power's Grumet said that energy policy has become a core aspect of each party's political base, leading each party to campaign and then govern based on energy ideology rather than pragmatism which, in turn, creates instability.

""The idea that every four years the rug could get pulled out is just devastating to investment in this country,"" Grumet told Newsweek.

""If we don't figure out how to take that kind of ideological edge out of our industrial investment, we are not going to modernize the country,"" he added.",https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2721523/cover-china-energy.jpg,N,,2025-09-17 06:58:25.769635

What the EPA is proposing is truly remarkable and has several environmental organizations up in arms. It plans to repeal all “greenhouse gas” emissions standards for the power sector under Section 111 of the Clean Air Act (CAA), as well as repeal amendments to the 2024 Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS). It claims the Biden administration was responsible for several coal-fired plants shutting down in recent years.

The EPA is looking to align with the current President’s executive orders

The EPA has taken the stance that the Biden-era regulations have hampered the coal, oil, and gas-fired power plants’ operations and increased the cost for all the companies involved, which has resulted in the average American family experiencing high daily living costs.

“Affordable, reliable electricity is key to the American dream and a natural byproduct of national energy dominance. According to many, the primary purpose of these Biden-Harris administration regulations was to destroy industries that didn’t align with their narrow-minded climate change zealotry. Together, these rules have been criticized as being designed to regulate coal, oil and gas out of existence.” – U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Lee Zeldin

The EPA is hailing the proposal as “the most consequential day of deregulation in the history of the United States.” The Biden administration was, according to the EPA and the Trump administration, were only concerned with the optics of implementing changes to the industry that gave them a sense of moral superiority without considering the rise in energy demands that has come off the back of the explosion of AI companies in the United States.

In March of this year, the EPA announced its plans to reconsider the Biden-era MATS requirements, which led to several sites being forced to close down; however, those sites may have the chance to reopen once the new proposal passes the necessary legal hurdles.

Right now, finding a working and available charger in South Carolina is too difficult.
That means jobs, including in South Carolina.
Open data, by increasing EV adoption, would help create jobs in South Carolina.
Elaine Buckberg leads the Driving Toward Seamless Public EV Charging project at Harvard University.","Not long ago, when my husband and I moved from Detroit to Boston, we drove the 600 miles twice in electric vehicles. A short road trip by American standards turned into a frustrating validation of our range anxiety.

The reason: a lack of data.

While Tim concentrated on the highway, my job as passenger was to cross-reference charger apps. One app would plan a route with supposedly optimized charging stops, but it often didn’t tell me if the chargers were working. So I would try looking up each one on the charging provider’s proprietary website — a time-consuming effort that would be dangerous for anyone driving solo.

This frustrating status quo is holding back EV sales and costing American jobs. Many charging providers do not share live data about their equipment — basic stuff, like whether it’s working or broken. This discourages prospective EV drivers: Concern about public charging is the No. 1 reason people do not buy an EV, according to J.D. Power surveys. Publishing this information is a way to spur EV adoption.

South Carolina can lead the way with a straightforward fix, and it would cost the state next to nothing.

Right now, finding a working and available charger in South Carolina is too difficult. For instance, on the nearly 200-mile drive from Lee County to Savannah, not one charging station shares data on PlugShare, the leading EV-charging app.

The solution is simple and cheap: If all chargers reported their status live so that any mapping app could include this basic information, drivers could easily navigate to working, available chargers. Were this information available, the chargers’ status would appear in your favorite map app, much like Google Maps shows if a restaurant is open. That would go a long way toward eliminating range anxiety.

Moreover, if someone shines a light on broken chargers, operators will fix them faster, enabling EV drivers to trust what their phones tell them.

My team’s research projects that making real-time data universal for highway fast chargers would raise the EV share of new vehicle sales by 6 percentage points in 2030 — to about 46 percent — under current policies. As a result, there would be 3.5 million more EVs on the road by 2030.

That means jobs, including in South Carolina. The Bosch plant in Dorchester County, which began making electric motors in 2022, wants to hire hundreds of new workers as it ramps up production. At its Ridgeville EV plant, Volvo plans to almost double employment. When Congress ended EV tax rebates with the One Big Beautiful Bill, it threatened those jobs. Open data, by increasing EV adoption, would help create jobs in South Carolina.

Charging operators may object, saying their information, available in their proprietary apps, has commercial value and they don’t want to provide too much information to their competitors.

Yet those very operators would benefit if this data helped the EV market take off faster. With 3.5 million more EVs on the road in 2030, operators will enjoy a market that is 9 percent larger. That means more charging sessions, enabling them to pay off their investments faster.

If charging providers don’t start voluntarily posting the real-time status of their fast chargers, the South Carolina Legislature should require open real-time data. Massachusetts has done so, and the California Electricity Commission is proposing the same.

My team and I have just published model legislation that can help the Palmetto State adopt such commonsense policies.

Making a road trip in an EV shouldn’t be hard. And it doesn’t have to be. If charging providers open access to their data, expect to see many more EVs on the road.

But there’s broad public support for growing the grid and allowing more electricity, including cheap, clean energy, to come online.

So says a new survey of likely voters in Ohio and Pennsylvania — two states in the severely backlogged PJM Interconnection grid region — and Arkansas, Mississippi, and Missouri, which are covered by the Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO). The survey was conducted by polling firm Cygnal on behalf of the Conservative Energy Network.

Roughly three-fourths of likely voters support expanding the electric grid, the survey found. About two-thirds are in favor of adding more transmission lines to connect clean energy and strengthen grid reliability.

And nearly 90% of respondents are concerned about rising energy costs. A majority of surveyed Republicans, Democrats, and Independents said they are ​“very concerned.”

“This is not a partisan issue. … You don’t have to appeal to one side or another,” said Chris Lane, a senior partner at Cygnal, who previewed the findings at the National Conservative Energy Summit in Cleveland on Aug. 25.

He noted that the results stand out for their consistency between regions and among different groups — including political parties. Even so, the Trump administration has in recent months worked against grid expansion, not toward it.

Adding more ​“lanes” to the grid

Energy costs are climbing in part because of rising power demand from data centers and the electrification of buildings and vehicles. Bringing more electricity generation online — especially quick-to-build, low-cost wind and solar — could increase competition and lower prices under the basic principles of supply and demand.

But just as transportation planners need to make sure highways can handle increased road traffic, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and regional transmission operators need to make sure the grid has room for more electrons. That calls for more ​“lanes” in the form of added transmission lines, plus technologies to squeeze more capacity out of the system overall.

Currently, ​“there aren’t enough power lines, they’re not all in the right places, and the ones we have are too outdated to meet the rising power demand for electricity,” Evelyn Robinson, director of PJM affairs for the renewable-energy industry group MAREC Action, said during a separate panel at the conference in Cleveland.

While all of the United States faces delays in getting new energy onto the grid, the problem is worst in the PJM region, where hundreds of projects have been stalled in the queue for years. To deal with the backlog, the grid operator switched to a new interconnection process in 2023; as of June, PJM still had about 63 gigawatts of power, mostly clean energy, stuck in that ​“transition queue.”

Across the country, wind, solar, and battery storage make up most of the resources waiting to come online, and their ​“levelized cost of energy” is cheaper or on par with other electricity sources.

The Trump administration has called for ​“the rapid and efficient buildout” of energy infrastructure, including transmission lines and grid-enhancing technologies, ​“by easing Federal regulatory burdens.”

But the administration’s actions have so far had the opposite effect. A February executive order calling for review of independent agency rulings threatens the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s ability to expand transmission. And in July, the Trump administration canceled a $4.9 billion loan guarantee for the Grain Belt Express — the largest transmission line underway in the United States. The project aims to shuttle gigawatts of wind and solar power from the Great Plains to the East, and Sen. Martin Heinrich, D-N.M., has called the cancellation of its federal loan guarantee illegal.

The administration’s policies, including the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, are also expected to more than halve the amount of clean energy built over the next decade, further exacerbating concerns about soaring power prices and rising demand.

What’s on voters’ minds

The survey results may help the Conservative Energy Network convince decision makers to take steps to expand the grid.

“To the best of my knowledge, this is the first poll that’s been done in the PJM area testing these things, and in the MISO south area,” said John Szoka, the group’s CEO, at the National Conservative Energy Summit.

The polling also gauged the persuasiveness of four statements to support grid expansion. The takeaways could inform how advocates and legislators work to boost public support for clean energy.

Among conservatives in Ohio and Pennsylvania, a message focused on lower costs was about 12 times more likely to shift someone’s opinion than one about preventing blackouts, Lane noted. Messages about increasing American energy production, preventing blackouts, and providing positive job and economic impacts for Americans were more likely to move liberals than one about lowering costs.

Opinions were more divided on whether the federal government, states, or private companies should pay for grid expansion, although a slight majority of respondents in both the PJM and MISO areas said they would be willing to pay a few dollars more per month in the short term if it would reduce outages and lower costs over time.

Respondents were also mixed on who should get to choose how electricity is produced. States, landowners, and local officials all ranked above federal authorities.

Clean energy, meanwhile, received only modest support on its own. About one-fourth of the Ohio and Pennsylvania respondents said using clean energy was one of their top two policy goals, with nearly one-fifth of those surveyed in Arkansas, Mississippi, and Missouri giving that response.",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/GettyImages-2153309071_2025-09-16-214616_ejnm.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=eefe9ff5bd07264c7004ee9a51ec1ed3,N,,2025-09-17 06:58:35.190640

NEWPORT BEACH, Calif., September 16, 2025--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Clean Energy Fuels Corp. (NASDAQ: CLNE) has announced it has broken ground on three renewable natural gas (RNG) production facilities under its development agreement with Maas Energy Works. These projects span six dairies located in South Dakota, Georgia, Florida and New Mexico, and are expected to produce approximately three million gallons of RNG annually once fully operational.

Capturing methane from a combined herd of 24,300 dairy cows, preventing harmful emissions from entering the atmosphere, the RNG produced will be used to power heavy-duty trucking, transit and vocational fleets nationwide – providing a reliable supply of negative-carbon fuel to Clean Energy’s network of over 600 stations.

""Partnering with an industry leader like Maas Energy Works on these projects will enable us to quickly bring meaningful volumes of ultraclean fuel to the transportation market,"" said Clay Corbus, senior vice president of renewables at Clean Energy. ""We’re seeing rising demand for RNG from fleets looking to decarbonize, and breaking ground on these production facilities is a significant step forward in meeting that need.""

Maas Energy Works brings a unique approach to RNG production through its covered lagoon system. Unlike traditional anaerobic digester tanks which are more costly to build and operate, Maas Energy’s method involves capturing methane from manure stored in large, tarp covered lagoon digesters. This technique offers a cost-effective and efficient alternative for manure collection and RNG production.

Clean Energy has elected to move forward with three RNG projects with Maas Energy Works after finalizing diligence. All demonstrating strong economic viability, the projects are forecasted to cost $80 million and are on track for completion in 2026.

Clean Energy still has the rights to develop the other remaining projects at a later date as market conditions and project economics evolve.

Agriculture accounts for nearly 10 percent of U.S. GHG emissions and the transportation sector accounts for another 28%, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Capturing methane from farm waste lowers these emissions. RNG, produced by that captured methane and used as a transportation fuel, significantly lowers GHG emissions on a lifecycle basis when compared to diesel. This allows RNG to be one of the only fuels to receive a negative carbon-intensity score based on the reduction of emissions at the source and at the vehicle.

Clean power helps keep electricity bills affordable and ensures reliability for households and businesses.","The American Clean Power Association (ACP) has released its Clean Power Quarterly Market Report for the second quarter of 2025, showing that U.S. developers added more than 11 gigawatts of new utility-scale solar, wind, and energy storage projects. These installations represent $15.2 billion in investments and bring the total amount of clean energy capacity operating across the United States to more than 332 gigawatts, which is enough to power over 81 million homes.

Despite these additions, the growth represents less than a one percent increase compared to the same quarter in 2024, a sign that the clean power industry is facing headwinds. The pipeline of planned clean power projects showed almost no movement, growing by less than 100 megawatts to reach 184.5 gigawatts. Solar installations have dropped significantly, falling by 23 percent in the first half of 2025 compared to the previous year. Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs), which are contracts that secure clean energy for future delivery, also saw a steep decline, an early warning that federal policy challenges and shifting trade rules are undermining the country’s energy security and economic growth.

ACP’s CEO, Jason Grumet, expressed concern over these trends. He explained that while clean energy projects continue to add essential power to the grid, restrictive federal policies and unclear mandates are discouraging investment. Grumet stated that uncertainty created by bureaucratic delays and unclear requirements is freezing future projects at a time when the nation urgently needs more energy to support its expanding economy.

The report links these problems to federal actions from multiple agencies and an unstable tariff environment. As a result, developers and buyers have pulled back on new agreements, with 32 percent less capacity being contracted through PPAs in the first half of 2025 compared to the same period in 2024. Other types of agreements fell by 48 percent over the same period. Battery storage PPA announcements fell 88 percent between the first and second quarters of 2025, and wind PPAs dropped by 93 percent. Prices for corporate wind and solar PPAs also rose, increasing by 6 percent compared to the previous quarter and 8 percent compared to a year earlier. This uncertainty has stalled procurement growth as companies wait for clearer tax credit guidance and attempt to adjust to changing trade agreements.

In terms of construction, developers reported 83,403 megawatts of clean power projects under construction by mid-2025, spread across 580 different projects. Texas leads the country with 21 gigawatts of projects under development, followed by Arizona with 7.8 gigawatts, California with 7.2 gigawatts, New Mexico with 4.8 gigawatts, and Wyoming with 4.1 gigawatts. Energy storage continues to be an area of growth, with over 6.5 gigawatts of new storage capacity added in the first half of 2025—an increase of 63 percent compared to the first half of 2024.

Arizona achieved a major milestone this quarter by surpassing 10 gigawatts of total clean power capacity. During the quarter, the state added 1,220 megawatts of new solar capacity and 1,369 megawatts of new storage capacity. Arizona now has the third-largest storage fleet, the fifth-largest utility-scale solar capacity, and the second-largest clean power pipeline in the United States, behind Texas.

State-level data show that most of the new capacity added in Texas, Indiana, Arkansas, Kansas, and Michigan came from solar projects. Illinois was the only state among the top ten for quarterly additions to install more wind capacity than solar. The report also points out that eight of the top ten states for clean power additions in the second quarter voted Republican in the most recent presidential election, emphasizing that clean energy growth is not limited to one political party.

ACP highlighted the broader importance of clean energy, noting that it is the fastest energy resource to deploy. Clean power helps keep electricity bills affordable and ensures reliability for households and businesses. Grumet stressed that with electricity demand at historic highs, the country cannot afford policies that slow down power production or increase household energy costs.

The IEA estimate US wholesale electricity prices rose by 30-40% in the first half of 2025, compared with 2024.

Creating nearly 200 new jobs, the investment will support expected future growth in key industries, including data centers and the power grid. Rapid expansion of data centers in the US is expected to keep annual electricity demand growth above 2% in both 2025 and 2026, more than double the average growth rate over the past decade.

A new production line will be created in Mississippi for ABB’s innovative Emax 3 circuit breakers, an advanced technology used to protect critical infrastructure, such as data centers.

“This $110m investment in the US is part of our long-term strategy to support future growth in our biggest global market,” said Morten Wierod, ABB’s Chief Executive Officer. “Demand is being driven by key trends, from the surging power needs of AI in data centers, to grid modernization and customers improving energy efficiency and uptime to reduce their costs. Our investments will ensure we can meet growing demand from customers across North America in line with our local-for-local strategy.”

Manufacturing new technology

ABB will invest $15m to create a new production line for Emax 3 in its Senatobia, Mississippi site. The cutting-edge Emax 3 air circuit breaker improves the energy security and resilience of power systems in large facilities with high power demands, including data centers, advanced manufacturing sites, and airports. The new line is expected to open in 2026.

A $30m project will double the footprint of ABB’s Richmond, Virginia facility adding a new test center, warehouse and new assembly lines. The power quality and protection products made in Richmond are used by data centers, manufacturing plants and utilities to protect critical systems in essential operations and services, like servers, MRI machines and production lines from electrical failures. The new facility, opening in Q4 2025, will create around 100 new production and engineering roles.

In Arecibo, Puerto Rico, an investment of more than $30m will increase the size of the facility to accommodate three new production lines. Made for industrial and commercial operations in the US, technologies produced in Arecibo include smart circuit breakers and switching devices, essential power components that help distribute electricity, protect equipment and monitor energy usage. The expansion will create 90 new skilled jobs by the end of 2026.

A $35m investment will increase the capacity of ABB’s manufacturing facility in Pinetops, North Carolina. This will support expected demand for advanced low and medium voltage grid components from the utilities, and for data centers and industrial facilities. The expansion will support customers upgrading their energy infrastructure with advanced sensors and new switching and grid protection devices.

While Tesla has thousands of employees in California and Texas, some new electric vehicle plants have sputtered.","SOCIAL CIRCLE, Ga. (AP) — It seems like a terrible time to build an electric vehicle plant in the United States, but Rivian Automotive leaders say they’re confident as the company starts long-delayed work on a $5 billion facility in Georgia.

The money-losing California-based company broke ground Tuesday east of Atlanta despite President Donald Trump’s successful push to roll back electric vehicle tax credits. Starting Sept. 30, buyers will no longer qualify for savings of up to $7,500 per car.

CEO RJ Scaringe said Tuesday that Rivian will sell its R2 sport utility vehicles not for environmental or tax incentive reasons, but because it’s a superior vehicle.

“The description I’ll say for R2 is it isn’t an electric vehicle,” he said. “I describe R2 as an incredible five-passenger offroad machine. And it happens to be electric.”

Georgia plant is key to a mass market and profitability

The Georgia plant, first announced in 2021, is Rivian’s key to reaching profitability. Now the company makes the high-end R1T pickup truck and the R1S SUV in Normal, Illinois, as well as delivery vans for Amazon and others. Its truck prices start at $71,000.

The Illinois plant will begin making the smaller R2 next year, with prices starting at $45,000. An expanded Illinois plant will be able to assemble 215,000 vehicles yearly. But if the R2 is a hit, and if Rivian successfully produces an even smaller R3, it will need more capacity. Scaringe said the Georgia operation, able to make 200,000 vehicles yearly starting in 2028, is the “foundation for our growth.” Rivian plans another 200,000 in capacity in phase two, volume that would spread fixed costs over many more vehicles.

The projections would be a big leap from the 40,000 to 46,000 vehicles Rivian expects to deliver this year, down from 52,000 last year. The company says it’s limiting production in part to launch 2026 models.

“For Rivian, it’s do-or-die time,” said Alex Oyler, North American director of auto research firm SBD Automotive. “We saw with Tesla that the key to profitability is scale, and you can’t scale if your cheapest vehicle is $70,000. So they need that plant online to achieve a level of scale of R2 and ultimately R3.”

Challenges in the electric vehicle market

Sales growth is slowing for electric vehicles in the United States, rising only 1.5% in 2025’s first half, according to Cox Automotive.

Tesla accounted for almost 45% of U.S. electric vehicle sales in that period, according to Cox. But the giant is losing market share as others gain: General Motors’ slice of American EV sales has climbed to 13%. By comparison, Rivian had a 3% share in the first half of the year, behind Tesla and six traditional automakers.

But excluding Tesla, Rivian is the most successful startup automaker.

The company initially tapped a largely unfilled niche: demand for electric pickups and SUVs. But competition now includes Ford’s F-150 Lightning and the electric Chevrolet Silverado.

After an initial public offering in 2021, Rivian shares have fallen by more than 80%, while automaker shares overall have outpaced the broader stock market. Rivian lost $1.66 billion in 2025’s first half.

At the same time, some automakers’ ardor for electric vehicles is cooling. Stellantis last week canceled Ram’s electric truck program. Ford has delayed production at a new Tennessee plant. And General Motors abandoned plans to build electric vehicles in suburban Detroit.

“With all the competition out there in this market and the slowing growth of EVs, it does not play in Rivian’s favor,” said Sam Fiorani, a vice president at AutoForecast Solutions. “However, there still is an EV market out there.”

$1.5 billion in incentives for 7,500 jobs

Georgia has pledged $1.5 billion of incentives to Rivian in exchange for 7,500 company jobs paying at least $56,000 a year on average. Rivian can’t benefit from most incentives unless it meets employment goals, but the state is already spending $175 million to buy and grade land and improve roads.

Georgia Republican Gov. Brian Kemp, says he wants to make Georgia “the electric mobility capital of America,” but acknowledged Tuesday that “the road to get here has not been smooth.” He voiced confidence that Rivian can deliver “an innovation revolution” benefitting Georgians.

While Tesla has thousands of employees in California and Texas, some new electric vehicle plants have sputtered. Two separate EV makers that hoped to assemble vehicles in a former GM plant in Lordstown, Ohio, went bankrupt. Georgia’s Hyundai complex near Savannah is faring better, with production underway. However, a battery plant there has been delayed by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement arresting 475 people on site, including more than 300 South Koreans.

Rivian was supposed to be making trucks by now at the 2,000-acre (800-hectare) site near Social Circle, about 45 miles (70 kilometers) east of Atlanta. As the company burned through cash in 2024, it paused construction. But German automaker Volkswagen agreed to invest $5.8 billion in Rivian in exchange for software and electrical technology. And then-President Joe Biden’s administration agreed to loan Rivian $6.6 billion to build the Georgia plant.

Despite the Trump administration’s hostility toward EVs, Scaringe said Tuesday that Rivian has built “a very close relationship” with the U.S. Department of Energy and that the company’s goals align with some of Trump’s big ones, including “U.S. manufacturing, U.S. technology, U.S. technology that supports global business, and leading in all those areas.”

Kemp said he has urged Energy Secretary Chris Wright to back Rivian.

Some neighbors still oppose the plant

Rivian also faces opposition from some residents who say the plant is an inappropriate neighbor to farms and will pollute the groundwater.

“I planned on dying and retiring on the front porch and the biggest project in Georgia has to go next door to me, of all places in the country?” asked Eddie Clay, who lives less than a mile away. He says his well water turned mud-choked after excavation at the Rivian site.

There are other challenges for Rivian, including tariffs costing $2,000 per vehicle, the Trump administration ending a tax-credit program that will cost the company $140 million in revenue this year, and long-term threats from low-priced, cutting-edge Chinese EVs. But Scaringe said the start of construction shows Rivian is working through its challenges.

“These are not the kinds of things you start without having clear sight to be able to fully finish and launch,” he said.

“We don’t take this lightly. We fully recognize the importance of this to the community,” Scaringe said.

Channel 2’s Linda Stouffer hopped into an R1 SUV with Kemp and Scaringe for an exclusive conversation about what the new facility means.

“We’re very, very excited about this thing finally getting here. It’s been a long time coming,” Kemp said.

Scaringe says that once completed, this facility will be their global manufacturing hub.

“This will not only support the United States, but this is importantly going to support sales in Europe,” Scaringe said.

Both Kemp and Scaringe agree that the workforce is key to a major facility like this.

“One of the key reasons we’ve decided on Georgia, the workforce is just incredible both in terms of the education level and the education system, and, you know, we look at work ethic as something that’s really important,” Scaringe said.

Federal tax incentives for electric vehicles went away earlier this year, but Scaringe says this won’t affect the facility.

“We never designed the business, certainly enough for the site we’re talking about here, around incentives. So we always expected in the long term for those to go away,” he said.

But not everyone in the area supports the project.

“They picked the wrong county,” Joellen Artz said. “We don’t care that Rivian builds electric vehicles. We care about the water supply, which is polluted.”

Artz is part of a group pushing back against the plant, saying the county isn’t ready for the development and it would hurt the environment.

The first “Made in Georgia” Rivian vehicles are expected to roll out in 2028.

Four offshore wind farms are currently being built in America’s waters.","Maryland’s first offshore wind farm could have broken ground next year. But now the 114-turbine renewable energy project is all but doomed following the Trump administration’s most recent move in a long line of attacks on the industry.

In a motion filed Friday with the U.S. District Court in Maryland, the Interior Department asked a judge to cancel approval of the Maryland Offshore Wind Project, which was authorized in the final weeks of the Biden administration. The wind farm was expected to power over 718,000 homes in a Democrat-led state facing rocketing energy demands.

Officials claim that the agency’s Bureau of Ocean Energy Management made an ​“error” when assessing the turbines’ potential impact on other activities — like search and rescue operations and fishing — within the 80,000-acre swath of ocean where the wind farm would be located.

The project is over a decade in the making, with developer US Wind purchasing the lease in 2014. But after President Donald Trump signed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act in July and greatly shortened the duration of the wind energy tax credit, Maryland’s first offshore wind farm already seemed impossible to pull off — at least economically.

Harrison Sholler, an offshore wind analyst with BloombergNEF, told Canary Media in July that with the tax credits sunsetting at a much earlier date, the Maryland project would likely no longer be able to offset 30% of its costs. The original rule for receiving the incentives required construction to start by 2033 or potentially even later, but the new law stipulates that wind farms must be ​“placed in service” by the end of 2027 or begin construction by July 4, 2026, to qualify.

Onshore construction is not supposed to start until next year at the earliest, and at-sea installation not until 2028, so the new deadline for receiving tax credits was crushing. Also, US Wind doesn’t have its financing in place yet to underwrite construction, according to Sholler. Securing financing without those credits guaranteed is a hard sell.

Analysts saw the tightening of the tax credit’s timeframe down to this one-year sprint as the final nail in the coffin for offshore wind farms that were fully approved but not currently underway.

Two projects — MarWin, the first phase of the Maryland Offshore Wind Project, and New England Wind off the Massachusetts coastline — exist in that gray zone. If the judge yanks its approval, MarWin will almost certainly be mothballed for the rest of Trump’s tenure.

Four offshore wind farms are currently being built in America’s waters. A fifth project, Revolution Wind, is 80% complete, but Interior Secretary Doug Burgum abruptly paused its construction in August, citing ​“national security” concerns. Project developer Ørsted is challenging the federal freeze in court. That saga is part of an escalating war on wind power led by the White House that has thrown the industry into chaos in recent weeks.

US Wind is a joint venture of the Italian corporate giant Toto Holding and Apollo Global Management, an investment firm. A spokesperson for the company said it will fight to maintain its approvals.

“After many years of analysis, several federal agencies issued final permits to the project,” spokesperson Nancy Sopko said in a public statement released Friday. ​“We intend to vigorously defend those permits in federal court, and we are confident that the court will uphold their validity and prevent any adverse action against them.”",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/GettyImages-489432163.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=b966f912c077cbe5d2f8b9002d63cf61,N,,2025-09-17 06:59:02.136679

The community energy fund has already helped provide funding for solar panels with battery backup at a new Advantage Behavioral Health Systems facility.
The fire department could use the $600,000 from the community energy fund to install solar panels at more fire stations.","Georgia’s Public Service Commission has authorized numerous utility rate hikes over the past five years, causing electricity prices to balloon by 40% across the state. Even worse, Georgia Power expects the state to use 45% more electricity in 2035 than it does today, mostly due to the expansion of power-hungry data centers. While incumbent PSC members have pledged not to raise rates for the next three years, that promise doesn’t include fuel cost recovery or disaster fees, so bills could continue to rise.

Relying on dirty forms of energy to meet the growing need for energy will have the effect of increasing the chance of severe weather events as time goes on, in addition to the impact it will have on household budgets. Georgia grants data centers reduced rates on their electricity bills, so ordinary households will bear the burden.

At the same time, elected officials across the country have been slow to address the twin problems of climate change and increasing energy costs, and in many cases, they’ve been downright hostile to adopting any solution.

But fortunately, here in Athens, there’s an upside to increasing energy costs. The mayor and commission established a “community energy fund” back in March 2020 that helps create a path out of relying on fossil fuels. This fund works by capturing increases in the franchise fee that utility companies pay to use public land for power, phone, internet and cable TV lines, and reallocates these dollars to clean energy projects that will help reduce local residents’ bills. When power bills go up, so does the franchise fee, and this money can be used to limit future increases.

The community energy fund has already helped provide funding for solar panels with battery backup at a new Advantage Behavioral Health Systems facility. It also has provided matching funds for a $5 million federal grant that will install 58 chargers for electric vehicles in locations around Athens, although that money is currently being held up by the Trump administration.

The most recent use of the community energy fund happened Sept. 2, when the commission unanimously agreed to spend $600,000 from the fund to create additional “resilience hubs” in Athens and another $150,000 on clean energy educational programming.

With extreme weather events becoming more and more common, public safety officials believe it’s all the more important to start planning for some dire scenarios. What happens if a powerful storm knocks out the power that our emergency responders need to do their jobs? Sometimes even a backup generator can fail if the pumps that provide the fuel stop working.

The ACC Fire Department already has solar panels plus battery storage installed at fire stations No. 2 (Cleveland Road) and No. 4 (Oglethorpe Avenue), with fossil fuel-powered generators also available if needed. The fire department could use the $600,000 from the community energy fund to install solar panels at more fire stations. The ACC Leisure Services Department is also currently evaluating what its role could be in creating new resilience hub sites that can keep the lights on in the case of an emergency.

The ACC Sustainability Department considers education to be a foundational part of the county’s transition to 100% clean and renewable energy, with an official goal of 2035 for the county government and 2050 for the community as a whole. To that end, the department will use $150,000 to create educational resources and host training events to help residents and local businesses learn to reduce their energy usage and lower their power bills.

The commission also authorized the first steps to create a green incentive program for local businesses that could involve spending $500,000 from the community energy fund over the next year. It also approved a tentative first step towards a partnership with the Athens Housing Authority to provide solar installations that would lower the bills of public housing residents.",https://flagpole.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/CleanEnergy-FireStation4-BlakeAued.jpg,N,,2025-09-17 01:58:36.136911

“The draft order also contradicts the legislature’s intent when it restored net metering in Nevada.
The proposed demand charge would go into effect in April 2026.

“The draft order issued by the Nevada PUC unfairly imposes a mandatory demand charge on all residential customers in southern Nevada and rewrites the rules for new solar customers in northern Nevada,” said Wil Gehl, InterMountain West senior manager for SEIA. “The draft order also contradicts the legislature’s intent when it restored net metering in Nevada. This is a significant step backward that makes solar less accessible for Nevada families, and we urge the Commissioners to change course.”

The PUC says the new “daily demand charge” for residential and small business customers would lower bills for most customers of NV Energy.

The demand charge would be included as a separate component in monthly bills and would be based on the maximum amount a ratepayer uses the electric system each day. The PUC says it would create an opportunity for residential and small business customers to lower their bills by spreading out their energy usage and avoiding simultaneous operation of numerous appliances.

The proposed demand charge would go into effect in April 2026.

“With the federal government abruptly ending its support of residential solar, Nevadans now face an even bigger hurdle to accessing one of the few ways to reduce their electricity bills. The draft decision discourages private investment in reliable, affordable, clean energy at a time when the grid needs every electron it can get to power Nevada’s economy,” Gehl said.

According to the U.S. Solar Market Insight Q3 2025 report by SEIA and Wood Mackenzie, over 144,000 Nevada homes have solar, and Nevada has the third-most residential solar capacity per capita of any state.

A new forecast by Ernst & Young Global Limited now predicts a five-year delay in electric vehicles making up 50% of the new car marketshare. While previous forecasts predicted America would reach that mark by 2034, the new forecast pushed that back to 2039.

“The U.S. faces policy uncertainty, high costs, and infrastructure gaps,” said Constantin M. Gall, the company’s global aerospace defense and mobility leader.

Clean energy advocacy groups are decrying this move away from electric vehicle initiatives, largely blaming the Trump administration.

“The transition to electric vehicles now faces significant roadblocks,” said Ecology Center in an April report. “The Trump administration has rolled back key policies supporting clean transportation.”

It also pointed to a nationwide deregulation of the gas-powered vehicle industry for allowing those to remain “dominant” over electric vehicles.

“These actions prioritize fossil fuels over clean energy, threatening progress toward a sustainable transportation future,” the report stated.

While bad news for electric vehicle supporters, the Michigan automotive industry could be a winner as companies re-shift focus back to gas-powered and hybrid vehicles.

With billions of dollars previously allocated to federal pollution fines and electric vehicle costs now available for investment, GM now plans to increase production at a Detroit-area plant by 2027.

The Michigan-based company also recently announced plans to invest billions into another Michigan plant in Lake Orion Township.

For similar reasons, Ford’s CEO Jim Farley told analysts that the company anticipates monetary savings “has the potential to unlock a multibillion-dollar opportunity over the next two years.”

Gretchen Whitmer has long been a proponent for the electric vehicle industry, she did recently emphasize her support for all Michigan-based manufacturing, no matter the type.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/thecentersquare.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/1/f9/1f928ba7-16ac-4436-8ef5-2c7a231f0805/67ec1961e214e.image.jpg,N,,2025-09-17 03:01:06.914099

This is all about helping to maximise the economic and industrial benefits of the shift to clean energy and net zero.

This investment will help ensure we have strong supply chains for the more sustainable fuels that can power our trucks, cargo ships and planes into the future.

The new ten‑year Cleaner Fuels Program will stimulate private investment in Australian onshore production of low carbon liquid fuels, such as renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel.

The first production of ‘drop‑in’ cleaner fuels, which can be directly substituted for existing fuels and work in today’s engines, is estimated by 2029.

Australia has the ingredients needed to make cleaner liquid alternatives to fossil fuels, with ready access to feedstocks like canola, sorghum, sugar and waste.

Thanks to our advanced farming practices and access to cheap and reliable renewable energy, Australia is in an enviable position to produce cleaner, low carbon liquid fuels that jets, ships, construction machines and heavy trucks need to reach net zero.

Liquid fuels make up around half of Australia’s national energy use. Replacing those fossil fuels with cleaner alternatives would deliver a massive climate and economic opportunity.

Australia already exports nearly $4 billion of suitable feedstocks like canola and tallow. But the Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC) estimates an Australian low carbon liquid fuel industry could be worth $36 billion by 2050 – highlighting the untapped potential of developing local refining and value‑adding capability.

Funding to make cleaner fuel on Australian shores, from Australian feedstock will help back Australian innovators from the farmer to the fuel bowser, make our fuel supply greener and more resilient and make low carbon fuels available for early adopters.

Details about eligibility will be considered through public consultation and design work to take place this financial year. Grants will be awarded through a competitive process to ensure we get value for taxpayer funds.

The new production‑linked incentive builds on the Government’s support through the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Funding Initiative and the Future Made in Australia Innovation Fund. Recipients will also need to deliver benefits according to the community benefit principles under the Future Made in Australia Act.

The Government is also supporting the market by expanding the Guarantee of Origin Scheme to include low carbon liquid fuels and has established a fuel quality standard for renewable diesel.

A recent report from the CEFC found that a mature Australian low carbon liquid fuels industry could deliver around 230 million tonnes CO2‑e in cumulative emissions reduction by 2050. This is equivalent to 2.3 times Australia’s current annual transport emissions, or the annual emissions from 86 million cars.

Quotes attributable to the Treasurer, Jim Chalmers MP

“Low carbon liquid fuels are an enormous economic opportunity for Australia.

“It’s about making Australians and our economy big beneficiaries of the global net zero transformation.

“Developing this industry has potential to make us an indispensable part of growing global net zero supply chains.

“This is a downpayment on developing an entirely new industry in Australia.

“From the farm to the refinery, from primary production to processing, this will create more jobs and more opportunities for Australian workers and businesses.

“It’s another way we’re helping Australians grasp the big benefits on offer in the transformation to cleaner and cheaper energy – to help lift wages, grow living standards, create jobs and grow our economy.”

Quotes attributable to Minister for Climate Change and Energy, Chris Bowen MP

“Making cleaner fuels here, from Australian feedstocks, creates the path for emissions reduction in sectors that are hardest to clean up, like plane travel and construction machines.

“Across the nation we have 2 billion litres worth of projects in the pipeline, many of which are ready to scale up production. A new thriving domestic industry with more jobs in our regions, from farmers growing the inputs to workers refining the fuels of the future is within our reach.

“$1.1 billion for low carbon liquid fuels production here in Australia builds on the $250 million we have already allocated to low carbon liquid fuels research and development through the Future Made in Australia Innovation Fund.”

Quotes attributable to Acting Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government, Murray Watt

“As demand for air travel grows, and more goods are moved by road and rail, it’s essential we invest in future fuels that allow us to facilitate this increasing demand while meeting our net‑zero targets.

“Low carbon fuels have the potential to be a $36 billion industry here in Australia, and we have the opportunity to lead the way on the production of these new fuels.

“We have the renewable feedstocks, access to clean energy and a strong agriculture base, all of which will allow us to develop this new industry, create new jobs and power how Australians move for decades to come.”

Quotes attributable to Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Julie Collins MP

“We’re committed to unlocking more opportunities to harness our feedstocks, which is why this investment is great news for our farmers and our regional communities.

“Producing more low carbon liquid fuels right here in Australia won’t just benefit our fuel security and emissions reduction, it will support Australian farmers, foresters and our regions.

“Our farmers and foresters have always been innovators and our Government is putting their expertise and world‑class production practices at the centre of growing Australia’s low carbon liquid fuel industry.

While the absence of granular 2024–2025 data on cost-benefit dynamics and scalability presents analytical challenges, broader trends in energy efficiency, regulatory shifts, and infrastructure innovation suggest that wood-based heating is gaining traction as a viable alternative to fossil fuels. This article examines the evolving economics, technical advancements, and policy alignment of residential wood heating, arguing that strategic investments in this sector can yield both financial returns and environmental impact.

Efficiency Improvements: Bridging to Competitiveness

Modern wood heating systems—ranging from pellet boilers to advanced masonry stoves—have seen significant efficiency gains over the past decade. According to a 2023 report by the International Energy Agency (IEA), contemporary wood pellet boilers achieve thermal efficiencies of 85–90%, rivaling natural gas furnaces while emitting 90% less particulate matter than traditional wood stoves. Innovations in insulation and heat distribution, such as phase-change materials and AI-driven thermostats, further enhance performance by minimizing energy loss and optimizing user comfort.

For instance, a case study from the European Biomass Association highlights a Swedish municipality where retrofitting homes with pellet boilers reduced heating costs by 40% over five years, despite initial capital expenditures. These improvements are critical for overcoming historical criticisms of wood heating, such as labor intensity and inconsistent output.

Cost-Benefit Dynamics: A Long-Term Perspective

The upfront costs of residential wood heating systems remain a barrier, with pellet boilers averaging $6,000–$12,000 and wood chip systems requiring additional infrastructure for storage and delivery. However, long-term savings on fuel and maintenance often offset these expenses. A 2022 analysis by BloombergNEF found that households in colder climates could achieve payback periods of 7–10 years when switching from oil or propane to wood-based systems, assuming stable fuel prices.

Scalability, a concept defined as a system's ability to adapt to increased demand without compromising performance: GeeksforGeeks, [ 6 ], becomes a key consideration. Unlike centralized heating networks, wood heating systems can scale horizontally—expanding from single-family homes to multi-unit buildings or community-scale projects. For example, a 2021 project in Vermont demonstrated how a district heating system using locally sourced wood chips reduced a town's heating costs by 30% while creating jobs in the forestry sector.

Decarbonization and Regulatory Alignment

Wood heating's alignment with decarbonization goals hinges on its carbon-neutral credentials, provided sustainable sourcing practices are enforced. The U.S. Department of Energy notes that modern wood systems can achieve net-zero carbon emissions when paired with reforestation initiatives and low-emission combustion technologies. This positions wood heating as a complementary solution to electrification strategies, particularly in regions with abundant biomass resources.

Regulatory trends further bolster its viability. The 2024 European Green Deal's emphasis on “circular bioeconomies” has spurred subsidies for biomass heating in rural areas, while the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act offers tax credits for off-grid energy systems. These policies not only reduce financial risks for investors but also signal a long-term shift toward decentralized, renewable energy solutions.

Infrastructure Investment Opportunities

To unlock wood heating's full potential, infrastructure investments are critical. This includes:

1. Supply Chain Optimization: Developing regional pellet production facilities and storage hubs to reduce transportation costs.

2. Smart Integration: Pairing wood systems with solar thermal or battery storage to create hybrid microgrids.

3. Policy Advocacy: Supporting zoning reforms and emissions standards that prioritize clean-burning technologies.

A 2023 McKinsey report estimates that scaling biomass heating infrastructure in North America could generate $15 billion in annual savings by 2035, driven by reduced fossil fuel dependence and job creation.

Conclusion: A Strategic Bet on Resilience

While the lack of 2024–2025-specific data introduces uncertainty, the convergence of efficiency gains, regulatory tailwinds, and decarbonization imperatives makes residential wood heating an attractive investment. For investors, the key lies in balancing short-term risks with long-term resilience—particularly in markets where energy independence and sustainability are non-negotiable.

Dive Brief:

Dive Insight:

The agreement will allow Mars and its supply chain to benefit from the entirety of the clean energy output produced by Enel’s three solar plants in Texas, the companies said.

Enel said vegetation at all three sites will be managed through “sheep grazing,” a sustainable dual-use practice that combines energy production with agriculture by using sheep to manage vegetation under and around solar panels instead of mechanical mowers or herbicides. The energy company signed a contract with Texas Solar Sheep last year, which will deploy over 6,000 sheep to control vegetation at eight solar plants located in the state.

The partnership with Enel builds on the confectionery giant’s “Renewable Acceleration” program, launched in April. The strategy is designed to fast-track the shift from fossil fuels to clean energy, not only for sites owned by Mars, but across its entire supply chain, by meeting the entirety of its electricity needs through the renewables market.

The McLean, Virginia-based multinational — behind brands like Snickers, Twix, Altoids, M&M’s and its namesake chocolate, Mars — said renewable electricity could be sourced to power all sorts of company operations through the Renewable Acceleration program.

Australia has the ingredients needed to make cleaner liquid alternatives to fossil fuels, with ready access to feedstocks like canola, sorghum, sugar and waste.

Thanks to our advanced farming practices and access to cheap and reliable renewable energy, Australia is in an enviable position to produce cleaner, low carbon liquid fuels that jets, ships, construction machines and heavy trucks need to reach net zero.

Liquid fuels make up around half of Australia’s national energy use. Replacing those fossil fuels with cleaner alternatives would deliver a massive climate and economic opportunity.

Australia already exports nearly $4 billion of suitable feedstocks like canola and tallow. But the Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC) estimates an Australian low carbon liquid fuel industry could be worth $36 billion by 2050 – highlighting the untapped potential of developing local refining and value-adding capability.

Funding to make cleaner fuel on Australian shores, from Australian feedstock will help back Australian innovators from the farmer to the fuel bowser, make our fuel supply greener and more resilient and make low carbon fuels available for early adopters.

Details about eligibility will be considered through public consultation and design work to take place this financial year. Grants will be awarded through a competitive process to ensure we get value for taxpayer funds.

The new production-linked incentive builds on the Government’s support through the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Funding Initiative and the Future Made in Australia Innovation Fund. Recipients will also need to deliver benefits according to the community benefit principles under the Future Made in Australia Act.

The Government is also supporting the market by expanding the Guarantee of Origin Scheme to include low carbon liquid fuels and has established a fuel quality standard for renewable diesel.

A recent report from the CEFC found that a mature Australian low carbon liquid fuels industry could deliver around 230 million tonnes CO2-e in cumulative

emissions reduction by 2050. This is equivalent to 2.3 times Australia’s current annual transport emissions, or the annual emissions from 86 million cars.

Quotes attributable to the Treasurer Jim Chalmers:

“Low carbon liquid fuels are an enormous economic opportunity for Australia.

“It’s about making Australians and our economy big beneficiaries of the global net zero transformation.

“Developing this industry has potential to make us an indispensable part of growing global net zero supply chains.

“This is a downpayment on developing an entirely new industry in Australia.

“From the farm to the refinery, from primary production to processing, this will create more jobs and more opportunities for Australian workers and businesses.

“It’s another way we’re helping Australians grasp the big benefits on offer in the transformation to cleaner and cheaper energy – to help lift wages, grow living standards, create jobs and grow our economy.”

Quotes attributable to Minister for Climate Change and Energy Chris Bowen:

“Making cleaner fuels here, from Australian feedstocks, creates the path for emissions reduction in sectors that are hardest to clean up, like plane travel and construction machines.

“Across the nation we have 2 billion litres worth of projects in the pipeline, many of which are ready to scale up production. A new thriving domestic industry with more jobs in our regions, from farmers growing the inputs to workers refining the fuels of the future is within our reach.

“$1.1 billion for low carbon liquid fuels production here in Australia builds on the $250 million we have already allocated to low carbon liquid fuels research and development through the Future Made in Australia Innovation Fund.”

The Ynni Cymru Capital Grant Scheme aims to accelerate the deployment of Smart Local Energy Systems (SLES) and is a key part of Wales’ ambitious goal to generate 100% of its electricity from renewable sources by 2035.

SLES have wide-ranging benefits including the potential to reduce energy costs, create local jobs and build more resilient energy infrastructure for local communities.

They can be delivered by community energy organisations, social enterprises, public sector bodies, and SMEs developing innovative local energy projects.

Successful projects in this round include over £910,000 for the Wales Millennium Centre to invest in solar panels, a new battery energy storage system, EV chargers and solar thermal for hot water – with energy savings expected to be reinvested into the community, and almost £750,000 for Coleg Cambria towards creating a low carbon learning hub and energy-efficient building.

Cabinet Secretary for Economy, Energy and Planning, Rebecca Evans, said:

“We’re putting communities at the heart of Wales' clean energy transition and I’m grateful to organisations for bringing forward their innovative proposals.

“There is clearly an appetite for energy systems that keep the benefits within our communities, and I’m delighted we are able to support so many quality projects.

“Smarter, cleaner energy generation will have wide-ranging benefits and importantly, a positive impact on people all across Wales.”

To see how previous grants have transformed local energy systems, the Cabinet Secretary visited South Cornelly in Bridgend where Challoch Energy Ltd and the South Cornelly Renewable Energy Community Interest Company (SCRE-CIC) partnered to create the South Cornelly Local Energy Market.

Solar panels, battery storage and smart controls have been added to over 50 homes, allowing everyone in the village to benefit from lower cost renewable electricity being generated on local rooftops with residents able to save 20-50% on their energy bills as a result.

Managing Director of Challoch Energy, Dr Simon Minett, said:

“Our partnership with SCRE-CIC has been a great success with the residents of the village keen to join the journey towards decarbonisation, cost reductions, and the ability to take control of their energy requirements.

“The Ynni Cymru grant support last year was the catalyst of change and is the first major step in creating the smart local energy system to benefit all residents.

Clean Energy Fuels Corp. has announced it has broken ground on three renewable natural gas (RNG) production facilities under its development agreement with Maas Energy Works. These projects span six dairies located in South Dakota, Georgia, Florida and New Mexico, and are expected to produce approximately 3 million gallons of RNG annually once fully operational.

Capturing methane from a combined herd of 24,300 dairy cows, preventing harmful emissions from entering the atmosphere, the RNG produced will be used to power heavy-duty trucking, transit and vocational fleets nationwide – providing a reliable supply of negative-carbon fuel to Clean Energy’s network of over 600 stations.

“Partnering with an industry leader like Maas Energy Works on these projects will enable us to quickly bring meaningful volumes of ultraclean fuel to the transportation market,” said Clay Corbus, senior vice president of renewables at Clean Energy. “We’re seeing rising demand for RNG from fleets looking to decarbonize, and breaking ground on these production facilities is a significant step forward in meeting that need.”

Maas Energy Works brings a unique approach to RNG production through its covered lagoon system. Unlike traditional anaerobic digester tanks which are more costly to build and operate, Maas Energy’s method involves capturing methane from manure stored in large, tarp covered lagoon digesters. This technique offers a cost-effective and efficient alternative for manure collection and RNG production.

Clean Energy has elected to move forward with three RNG projects with Maas Energy Works after finalizing diligence. All demonstrating strong economic viability, the projects are forecasted to cost $80 million and are on track for completion in 2026.

Clean Energy still has the rights to develop the other remaining projects at a later date as market conditions and project economics evolve.

Agriculture accounts for nearly 10 percent of U.S. GHG emissions and the transportation sector accounts for another 28%, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Capturing methane from farm waste lowers these emissions. RNG, produced by that captured methane and used as a transportation fuel, significantly lowers GHG emissions on a lifecycle basis when compared to diesel. This allows RNG to be one of the only fuels to receive a negative carbon-intensity score based on the reduction of emissions at the source and at the vehicle.

“They omit and minimize the importance of climate change in driving uncontrollable wildfires today,” Moran said.
“My first reaction to opening the DOE report was, ‘wow, that was like a time capsule from 25 years ago,’” Kopp said.
It cites the DOE report, though Kopp says the DOE doesn’t even say that.
“I’d say the other thing that’s different, though, is that people across the country are experiencing climate change every single day,” she said.","The “endangerment finding” is a seemingly nondescript term for what is arguably the most critical regulation in the U.S.’s climate change-fighting arsenal.

It allows the federal government, under the authority of the Clean Air Act, to regulate the greenhouse gas emissions that are warming the planet and in turn causing climate change.

The U.S. Supreme Court affirmed it almost 20 years ago.

President Donald Trump wants to get rid of it.

And that has unleashed a flood of outrage, along with increasingly coordinated pushback, from groups of scientists, climate experts, legal entities, governments, environmental advocates and individuals.

Connecticut is in the thick of it, with its emissions levels and air quality hanging in the balance.

The endangerment finding was specifically targeted for reconsideration in the conservative government playbook Project 2025. In March, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin announced it was under review, denigrating endangerment as “the Holy Grail of the climate change religion.” And on July 29, EPA announced it wanted endangerment gone.

Repealing the finding “will be the largest deregulatory action in the history of America,” Zeldin said.

“We will not let Trump and Zeldin do this without a fight,” said Connecticut Attorney General William Tong at the time. His office is now one of four on a leadership team, with California, New York and Massachusetts heading up a multistate pushback.

While the proposed repeal is viewed as catastrophic, what really incensed opponents and galvanized large group efforts to fight the administration was a draft climate report by the Department of Energy, conducted in secret, released simultaneously with the EPA announcement and used as justification for the repeal.

The DOE report was compiled by a working group of five known climate skeptics, if not outright deniers, handpicked by Energy Secretary Chris Wright. He has since disbanded the group in a letter that disputes the existence of climate change as “settled science.”

The report was not peer-reviewed, as is the norm with such material. It pulled information from existing research. But many scientists whose work was cited said the report cherry-picked information, then misinterpreted and lied about their findings.

Fury ensued.

Jennifer Marlon, executive director of the Yale Center for Geospatial Solutions and senior research scientist at the School of the Environment, who specializes in wildfires and climate change, is one of those whose work was cited. She said she found out through a network of friends and colleagues.

“’Hey, did you see that your paper is cited in this report that kind of says, oh, wildfires are not a problem?’” Marlon recalls hearing.

“DOE directly misinterpreted my study. They cited me and twisted my findings.”

The DOE report, she said, missed the importance of active suppression of wildfires and what it does to fuel sources. And it minimized, if not ignored, the importance of warming temperatures and changing precipitation rates. It used data known to be inaccurate.

“They omit and minimize the importance of climate change in driving uncontrollable wildfires today,” Moran said.

“I spent multiple years working to compile the data behind the article that they reference. And when you invest so much time and effort in careful scientific research, where you think about every sentence that you’re saying and you provide evidence for every claim that you make, and then you see somebody who knows nothing about wildfires whip out some sentences and make these graphs that misrepresent your data,” she said, “it made me angry and upset and motivated me to put down all my other work and say, ‘OK, I’m gonna respond to this.’”

Marlon joined a group of 85 scientists who provided what has become a massive refutation to the DOE report.

The pushback has come from the grassroots of science, but it’s also been increasingly coordinated because of the sheer volume of outrage.

“It is very unique,” Marlon said. ”It kind of comes out of the blue. It rises very quickly. It demands your full attention right now to respond quickly while you can. The Trump administration moves very, very quickly, and they always are starting fires in multiple places so that people are kind of scattered and trying to figure out, ‘how do we address the chaos that’s unfolding?’”

Science group efforts

It fell to Andrew Dessler, a climate scientist and director of the Texas Center for Extreme Weather at Texas A&M, to figure that out. He asked on social media if people like him and Marlon should have a coordinated response and, if so, who was organizing it.

“People took that to mean I was doing it. And so, ultimately, I agreed to do it,” he said.

The plan became to file a group response for both the DOE report and again with EPA on the proposed endangerment rollback. Coming in at some 460 pages — three times the length of the report — the first filing was made in time for the DOE report comment deadline on Sept. 2, which also drew a total of 59,563 written comments. The comment period for the proposed EPA rule rollback goes until Sept. 22.

“By coordinating it, we probably got more people to respond, because everyone sees everyone else doing it and a lot of people working together on sections,” said Dessler, who also said he was shocked at how many emails he got from people wanting to participate. “Also, I think it made the response better.”

He acknowledged the uniqueness of his effort.

“Yeah, it’s unique. What the government’s doing is unique. This is basically a show trial for climate science,” he said. “They picked the jury — all people that say CO2 is innocent — and then they wrote a report.”

In the end, he said, the administration will declare victory, and everybody knows that’s what’s going to happen.

“People are offended. People are doing it because they’re mad that these people are making a mockery of science,” he said. “I’ve spent my entire career doing science. I respect science. Science works.”

The comments the group submitted include experts responding to every section of the DOE report.

Among those participating was Robert Kopp, a noted climate scientist at Rutgers University whose research focuses on sea level rise, climate and their economic impacts. He also holds multiple titles on other climate endeavors and has helped author both national and international top climate reports. He co-edited the submission, co-authored the section on sea level changes, and his previous research was cited throughout.

“My first reaction to opening the DOE report was, ‘wow, that was like a time capsule from 25 years ago,’” Kopp said. “It’s the same people making essentially the same arguments for 25 years even as the evidence of climate change becomes clearer and the evidence of the damages climate change is causing become clearer.

“I feel like, as a scientist, I need to address the cherry picking and misrepresentation that DOE is putting out and that EPA is using.”

Kopp points specifically to subject matter he knows best — the claim in the EPA proposed rule that sea level rise has been minimal. It cites the DOE report, though Kopp says the DOE doesn’t even say that. It offers some contradictory minimal analysis in a couple of citings.

“I think they’ve tried to write the proposed rule such that they could give up on the science argument and still convince the Supreme Court of the validity,” he said.

Carrie Jenks, executive director of the Environmental and Energy Law Program at Harvard Law School, agrees.

“Their primary proposal is to undercut the legal authority to regulate greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act. They’re also proposing to attack the science, but they’re not relying on that. They don’t need to win on the science to undercut the legal authority,” Jenks said.

The goal, she said, seems to be to tie the hands of future administrations to prevent the regulation of greenhouse gases under the current Clean Air Act.

In an emailed statement, an EPA spokesperson appeared to confirm Jenks’ view.

“EPA’s proposal is legal in nature,” it read. “The Endangerment Finding is the legal prerequisite used by the Obama and Biden Administrations to regulate emissions from new motor vehicles and new motor vehicle engines. Absent this finding, EPA would lack statutory authority under Section 202(a) of the Clean Air Act (CAA) to prescribe standards for greenhouse gas emissions. EPA is bound by the laws established by Congress, including under the Clean Air Act. Congress never explicitly gave EPA authority to impose greenhouse gas regulations for cars and trucks.”

In an unusual move, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine have undertaken what they call a fast-track review of the latest evidence for whether greenhouse gas emissions endanger public health and welfare. At the time of the announcement in early August, Marcia McNutt, president of the National Academy of Sciences, said the review was in direct response to EPA’s proposal to rescind endangerment. The report is slated to be released Wednesday.

“Decades of climate research and data have yielded expanded understanding of how greenhouse gases affect the climate,” McNutt said in a statement at the time. “We are undertaking this fresh examination of the latest climate science in order to provide the most up-to-date assessment to policymakers and the public.”

Economists weigh in

Environmental and climate economists have also joined forces to respond to endangerment and the DOE report. So far there’s at least one group of a dozen. It includes Yale’s Ken Gillingham, senior associate dean of academic affairs. He has environmental and energy economics appointments in the environment and management schools and the economics department. He also served on the White House Council of Economic Advisers in the Obama administration.

The group has filed objections to the DOE report, focusing on three chapters with economic assertions. Among its findings are that the economics literature used “is woefully out of date;” that it “employs an array of fallacies” in saying climate damages are small compared with other trends; it accuses the report of using “strawman scenarios and fallacious reasoning” in its cost benefit analysis; and it says the report misrepresents the effect of climate change on agriculture and on secondary issues such has death from heat stress.

Gillingham is mainly focusing on the economic reasoning in the endangerment rollback, along with numbers in the regulatory impact analysis and the proposed rule itself. The group will be filing a new document in time for the Sept. 22 deadline, and Gillingham is also working with a second group of economists that will be filing comment as well.

Gillingham is questioning the EPA’s assertions that the cost of cars will increase, the choices for cars will decrease and old polluting cars will stay on the road longer.

“It’s disingenuous to be worried about increasing car prices when implementing a massive tariff policy that’s raising car prices,” he said. “They’re clearly not worried so much about car prices. They’re just trying to destroy environmental regulations.”

What Gillingham sees at work is influential parties who stand to lose money from a decarbonized economy.

“It’s inconvenient to have climate policy — to a set of people whose fortunes depend on fossil fuels,” he said. “They are very keen to see a rollback of the endangerment finding and anything that can be done to make it very difficult to regulate greenhouse gases. That’s fundamentally what’s going on.”

Legal pushback

While scientists and economists are coalescing to push back against the double-barreled endangerment rollback, a group of more than two dozen state attorneys general and chief legal officers in several cities are also coming together, as they have frequently in Trump’s second term.

The attorneys general, including Connecticut’s William Tong, have already filed an amicus brief in support of a lawsuit filed by the Environmental Defense Fund and the Union of Concerned Scientists that alleges the U.S. Department of Energy did not follow proper procedures in establishing the group that compiled the DOE report.

The group also filed 85 pages of comments against the report itself — enumerating the volumes of peer-reviewed research the report ignored and a 122-page appendix of state-by-state climate change impacts. Connecticut’s section notes the observed temperature increases, rise in sea levels that exceeds the global average and the region’s increase in climate extremes including storm intensity, rates of precipitation, flooding, heat and drought and the impacts from all of them.

A representative of Tong’s office has already testified during a live comment period on the legality of the Trump administration’s plan to dump endangerment. In the allotted two-and-a-half minutes, the testimony focused on how the proposed repeal denies the scientific reality that climate change is happening; that endangerment can only be changed by Congress, not the EPA; and that the proposal ignores health and other benefits of climate protection.

There were more than 600 live comments over four days of testimony (extended from the originally scheduled two days), that, according to observers, ran about 97% against and 3% in favor.

As of Sept. 15, more than 92,000 written comments were submitted on the endangerment repeal. The AG group filing on that will be a much-expanded version of its DOE comments.

“We’re pushing back on the junk science, but we’re also going to push back legally, procedurally and substantively legally that this is an illegal approach to rescinding the endangerment finding,” said Matthew Levine, deputy associate Connecticut attorney general and chief of the environment section. “I’ve been working on this stuff for decades, and the science is only continuing to improve and get better with specificity. We feel really confident on the facts and the support for it, and we also feel really confident on the legal issues as well.”

Endangerment in brief

Endangerment goes back to a 2007 U.S. Supreme Court ruling — Massachusetts v. EPA — that paved the way for EPA to regulate greenhouse gas emissions in motor vehicles in addition to the standard pollutants it had been regulating under the iconic Clean Air Act since it came into its modern existence in 1970.

The Act’s language says said that the EPA is required to regulate any air pollutant the administrator finds if the administrator finds they “cause, or contribute to, air pollution which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare.”

Two years later, the administrator did just that, and greenhouse gases — six of them — have been regulated as pollutants since.

It’s widely assumed the EPA will go ahead with rolling back endangerment. So it’s also widely assumed this matter will wind up back before the U.S. Supreme Court. Three of the four justices who voted against it originally remain on the court: Chief Justice John Roberts, Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito. None of the five justices who voted for it remain.

The use of the finding has been stretched since the original ruling to justify requiring emissions reductions from power plants and industrial facilities. In a related matter, the EPA proposed a rule on Sept. 12 to discontinue the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program signed into law in 2007 by President George W. Bush. The rule, which began operating a decade ago, required annual reporting of emissions by refineries, factories and other large industrial operations to make the public aware of emissions as a first step towards limiting them.

But the focus of endangerment in the current instance is for motor vehicles. And while the overall issue is wonky to the average person, it has a major impact on their lives, especially here in Connecticut.

Connecticut’s emissions

Connecticut set itself greenhouse gas emissions reduction goals to meet between now and 2050, when overall emissions are supposed to be 80% below 2001 levels. The annual GHG Inventory released by the state Department of Energy and Environmental Protection earlier this month shows the state continues to be off-track to meet its goals.

The transportation sector, which constitutes the largest source of those emissions, provided a small bright spot. Its emissions were down 2% in 2023 (the most recent data available) over 2022. Prior to the pandemic, during which emissions dipped dramatically, it had been trending up slightly. But to reach its sector goals, the rate of decrease will need to increase 3.6-fold to meet its next benchmark in 2030.

It is likely the 2023 decrease was driven by greater adoption of electric and more fuel-efficient vehicles, as well as power sector emissions reductions mandated during the Biden administration that would have helped clean up power plants upwind of Connecticut. But the potential rollback of endangerment, along with the Trump administration’s elimination of electric vehicle tax credits and other motor vehicle efficiency measures, including the more restrictive emissions levels some states follow, may send them back up.

“We are concerned that recent actions by the EPA to roll back power plant regulations, vehicle fuel economy standards, and even the Endangerment Finding will remove critical federal tools that contributed to this progress,” said DEEP Commissioner Katie Dykes in a statement that accompanied the report’s release.

DEEP would not make anyone available to discuss the endangerment repeal effort or the DOE report specifically, though Deputy Commissioner for Environmental Quality Emma Cimino did speak during the EPA live testimony on endangerment.

“Greenhouse gas emissions significantly impact human health by contributing to climate change, which in turn leads to various health problems including respiratory illnesses, heat-related illnesses, infectious disease outbreaks, food and water insecurity, and mental health issues,” Connecticut Public Health Commissioner Manisha Juthani said in a statement at the time. “Amid the EPA pulling back on these efforts, Connecticut will hold our values to protect and improve the health and safety of our residents.”

“If you want to address the contributions of climate change from Connecticut, there’s no way to do it without making rapid and large reductions in gasoline use,” said David Reichmuth, a senior scientist in the clean transportation program at the Union of Concerned Scientists. The EPA’s changes, he said, mean car buyers will have options that are less efficient and with higher emissions. “That‘s going to take us in the wrong direction. In a time where we need to be going as quickly as possible to reduce emissions, we’re going to be actually increasing emissions.”

The Trump administration argues in the endangerment rollback that the higher cost of EVs — now exacerbated by the loss of the EV tax credit coupled with tariffs, which Reichmuth calls disingenuous on the administration’s part — will cause people to hang onto existing dirtier cars for longer. It also claims lower emissions rules by class of vehicle means that any changes in each class will be negligible.

“The idea that the emissions from vehicles don’t matter — it flies in the face of all the of the data we have,” Reichmuth said, calling such arguments “absurd.”

He points out that even if the next administration were to reimpose tough GHG auto emission standards, the cars purchased under more permissive Trump standards could stay on the road for well over a decade. “You’re locking in decades of emissions from those new vehicles,” he said.

Advocates band together

Scientists like Harvard’s Carrie Jenks believe that public input will also be critical to the their cause in this effort.

“I think it’s important for stakeholders to give EPA as much information as they can,” she said. “I think it’s going to be important for EPA to really dig into that, and it’s going to be interesting to see how they do that.”

The Union of Concerned Scientists, like other advocacy groups, is no stranger to group efforts. It has sent out multiple emails requesting individuals file comments on endangerment and contact lawmakers. But Rachel Cleetus, the group’s senior policy director with the climate and energy program, said this one isn’t taking take much effort.

“This report is so egregious that it hasn’t even required a big coordinated effort,” she said. “Within 24 hours, there were scientists on the media, on social media, writing, from the perspective of their expertise, that this was just wrong. So many errors in this report, blatant, complete obfuscation of scientific facts.”

Cleetus was also among the hundreds who gave live testimony on the endangerment repeal effort. She said, as she waited her turn, that what struck her was the ordinary citizens who stepped up, like a woman from Texas on the panel before hers.

“She spoke so movingly about the impacts of Hurricane Harvey and then the recent floods in Texas and what it has meant for people in her community,” Cleetus said. “It’s heartbreaking, it’s enraging, actually. … This is not just political football. This really affects people’s lives.”

Among other organizing efforts, the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University immediately provided a full explanation of the issue along with templates for comment letters for both individuals and governments.

The Climate Action Campaign, CAC, which is a coalition of major national environmental, environmental justice and public health groups representing about 15 million members across the country, has stepped up.

Executive Director Margie Alt said their tactical approach is both group and individual efforts, but a couple of things are different this time. First, the Trump administration seems more organized than it was in the first administration, and the fossil fuel interests operating within it are exerting more pressure.

“I’d say the other thing that’s different, though, is that people across the country are experiencing climate change every single day,” she said. “We’re just seeing incredible, incredible public response, especially as people are affected by extreme weather, which they understand to be supercharged by the climate crisis.”

She, and many others, accused the Trump administration of making climate denial the official policy of the U.S.

“I don’t think the public is going to stand for it,” Alt said.

At the Natural Resources Defense Council, Madeline Hankins, the group’s federal climate legal director, said the organization is pulling out all the stops.

Hankins said they knew what rollbacks were coming but not how quickly and widespread.

“We have required some level of sort of coordination and capacity and trying to figure out, ‘OK, it’s all hands on deck, but who’s going to handle what, and how are we going to address this?’” Hankins said.

Most inspiring, Hankins said, were the tens of thousands of members who have filed comments and that, even at the height of summer, “we’re seeing scientists band together to really rebut this report, and they’re coming out of the woodwork to talk about how their research is being misquoted.”

That may have been what motivated Yale’s Marlon to begin with. But she also sees the contrast with the previous federal climate policies she said were designed to improve people’s health, provide cleaner air, cleaner water, lower the temperatures globally, and to even make money doing it.

“All of these tools and policies were like a road map to a safer, cleaner future,” she said. “Basically what these new efforts are doing are taking that map, tossing it out the window, turning off the headlights in the car, and stepping on the accelerator towards a cliff. It’s really endangering the lives of millions of people.”",https://assets.hartfordbusiness.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/alz-indiana-7.29.25-780x495-1-e1758018933820.jpg,N,,2025-09-17 06:58:48.848512

The Getting to Zero Coalition, an alliance of companies, governments and intergovernmental organizations, is asking member states of the International Maritime Organization to support adopting regulations to transition to green shipping, including the fee, when they meet in London next month. The statement was shared exclusively with The Associated Press in advance.

“Given the significance of the political decision being made, we think it is important that industry voices in favor of this adoption be heard,” Jesse Fahnestock, who leads decarbonization work at the Global Maritime Forum, said Monday. The forum manages the Getting to Zero Coalition.

The Trump administration unequivocally rejects the proposal before the IMO and has threatened to retaliate if nations support it, setting the stage for a fight over the major climate deal. The State Department said Monday the United States is “actively engaging with countries on the extremely flawed proposal,” as well as exploring and preparing to act on remedies should it be adopted. Those could include tariffs, visa restrictions and port levies. The department said it will propose that allies take similar steps.

The U.S. considers the proposed regulatory framework “effectively a global carbon tax on Americans levied by an unaccountable U.N. organization,” the U.S. Secretaries of State, Commerce, Energy and Transportation said in a joint statement last month.

U.S.-based shipping companies, however, have endorsed it. The Chamber of Shipping of America wants one global system, not multiple regional systems that could double charge vessels for their emissions depending on the route, said Kathy Metcalf, the chamber’s president emeritus.

Shipping emissions have grown over the last decade to about 3% of the global total as vessels have gotten bigger, delivering more cargo per trip and using immense amounts of fossil fuels. The IMO, which regulates international shipping, set a target for the sector to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by about 2050, and has committed to ensuring that fuels with zero or near-zero emissions are used more widely.

In April, IMO member states agreed on the contents of a regulatory framework to impose a minimum fee for every ton of greenhouse gases emitted by ships above certain thresholds and set a marine fuel standard to phase in cleaner fuels. The IMO aims for consensus in decision-making but, in this case, had to vote. The United States was notably absent. It will send a delegation to London next month, the State Department said.

Now nations have to decide if the regulations will enter into force in 2027. If agreed upon, the regulations will become mandatory for large oceangoing ships over 5,000 gross tonnage, which emit 85% of the total carbon emissions from international shipping, according to the IMO.

If nations don’t agree, shipping’s decarbonization will be further delayed and “the chance of the sector playing a proper and fair part in the fight to keep global heating below dangerous levels will almost certainly be lost,” said Delaine McCullough, president of the Clean Shipping Coalition and Ocean Conservancy shipping program director.

The U.S. secretaries said in their statement that ships will have to pay fees for failing to meet “unattainable fuel standards and emissions targets,” driving up costs, and the fuel standards would “conveniently benefit China.” China is a leader in developing and producing cleaner fuels for shipping.

While U.S. opposition and pressure cannot be taken for granted, it still appears as though a majority of countries currently support the regulations, said Faig Abbasov from Transport and Environment, a Brussels-based environmental nongovernmental organization. Abbasov said the deal reached in April was not ambitious enough, but this is an opportunity to launch the sector’s decarbonization and it can be strengthened.

Shipping companies want the regulations because it gives them the certainty needed to confidently make investments in cleaner technologies, such as fuels that are alternatives to fossil fuels and the ships that run on them. In addition to the Getting to Zero Coalition, the International Chamber of Shipping, which represents over 80% of the world’s merchant fleet, is advocating for adoption when nations meet at IMO Headquarters in London from Oct. 14 to 17.",https://finance-commerce.com/files/2025/09/Shipping.jpg,N,,2025-09-16 20:02:18.931116

Key Takeaways

The U.S. exported 97.6M tonnes of coal in 2024, representing 25% of its domestic coal production.

The top customers were all in Asia: India (23%), China (12%), and Japan (8%).

Coal remains a major U.S. export, even as the domestic energy mix shifts toward natural gas and renewables. In 2024, America exported nearly 100 million tonnes of coal to countries around the world, with a concentration of buyers in Asia.

This visualization breaks down the top destinations for U.S. coal exports last year. The data for this graphic comes from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA). It shows 2024 coal export volumes by destination, measured in millions of tonnes.

Asia: The Rising Demand Hub

India led the pack with 23.4% of all U.S. coal exports, followed by China (11.5%) and Japan (8.4%). Combined, these three Asian countries accounted for nearly 43% of all American coal exports.

Since 2017, Asia has eclipsed Europe as the leading destination for U.S. coal.

In 2024, India alone purchased 22.9 million tonnes. India’s high demand for U.S. coal is driven by a combination of energy security needs, domestic production gaps, and infrastructure limitations. Currently, the country relies heavily on coal to generate electricity—over 70% of its electricity comes from coal-fired power plants.

Europe’s Waning Role

While several European countries still import American coal, their overall share has declined. The Netherlands remains a key buyer (7.4%), but other nations like Germany, Italy, and Poland account for smaller volumes. The EU’s push to phase out coal and meet climate targets has sharply reduced demand in the region.

Notably, many European buyers now import U.S. coal primarily for metallurgical (steelmaking) rather than power generation uses.

Emerging and Niche Markets

Beyond Asia and Europe, a number of countries in Latin America, Africa, and the Middle East imported smaller quantities of U.S. coal in 2024. Brazil (7.8%) and Morocco (5.6%) were notable non-Asian buyers.

In its wake, investment in the U.S. electric vehicle industry accelerated. But in 2025, President Donald Trump’s so-called One Big Beautiful Bill Act eliminated most of the incentives, and U.S. investment collapsed.

Hitting the brakes on electric vehicles will clearly mean less progress in reducing transportation emissions and less strategic U.S. leadership in a key technology of the future. But in a new study, my colleagues at Carnegie Mellon University and I find that fewer electric vehicles will also mean less investment to clean up the electricity sector.

How we got here

U.S. electric vehicle adoption lags behind the rest of the world – especially China, which has invested heavily and strategically to dominate electric vehicle markets and supply chains and to leapfrog the historical dominance of American, European and Japanese manufacturers of vehicles powered by internal combustion engines.

Electric vehicles are much simpler to engineer, and this opened a window for China to bet big on EVs with investment, incentives and experimentation. As battery prices dropped dramatically, electric cars became real competition for gasoline cars – especially for the massive Chinese market, where buyers don’t have strong prior preferences for gasoline. China now dominates the supply chain for battery materials, such as lithium, nickel, cobalt and manganese, as well as the rare earth minerals used in electric motors.

In 2022, the U.S. took action to change this trend when Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act. The law encouraged EV adoption by lowering costs to manufacturers and consumers. But it also encouraged automakers to find ways to build EVs without Chinese materials by making the largest incentives conditional on avoiding China entirely.

After the law passed, investment soared across hundreds of new battery manufacturing and material processing facilities in the U.S.

But in 2025, Congress passed and Trump signed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which eliminated most of the incentives. U.S. investment in EV-related production has collapsed.

Electric vehicles are cleaner

As a scholar of electric vehicle technology, economics, environment and policy, I have conducted numerous peer-reviewed scientific studies characterizing benefits and costs of electric vehicles over their life cycle, from production through use and end of life. When charged with clean electricity, electric vehicles are one of the few technologies in existence that can provide transportation with near-zero emissions.

With today’s electricity grid, EV emissions can vary, depending on the mix of electricity generators used in the region where they are charged, driving conditions such as weather or traffic, the specific vehicles being compared, and even the timing of charging. But EVs are generally better for the climate over their life cycle today than most gasoline vehicles, even if the most efficient gas-electric hybrids are still cleaner in some locations. EVs become cleaner as the electricity grid becomes cleaner, and, importantly, it turns out that EVs can even help make the electricity grid cleaner.

This matters because transportation and electricity together make up the majority of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, and the passenger cars and light trucks that we all drive produce the majority of our transportation emissions.

In its efforts to prevent the government from regulating greenhouse gas emissions, the Trump administration is now claiming that emissions from cars and trucks are “not meaningful” contributors to climate change. But in reality, a technology that cleans up both transportation and electricity at the same time is a big deal.

An opportunity for cleaner electricity

Our research has found that turning away from electric vehicles does more than miss a chance to curb transportation emissions – it also misses an opportunity to make the nation’s electricity supply cleaner.

In our paper, my co-authors Lily Hanig, Corey Harper and Destenie Nock and I looked at potential scenarios for electric vehicle adoption across the U.S. from now until 2050. We considered situations ranging from cases with no government policies supporting electric vehicles to cases with enough electric vehicle adoption to be on track with road maps targeting overall net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.

In each of these scenarios, we calculated how the nation’s power grid and electricity generators would respond to electric vehicle charging load.

We found that when there are more electric vehicles charging, more power plants would need to be built – and because of cost competitiveness, most of those new power plants would be solar, wind, battery storage and natural gas plants, depending on the region.

Once wind and solar plants are built, they are cheaper to operate than fossil fuel plants, because utilities don’t need to buy more fuel to burn to make more electricity. That cost advantage means wind and solar energy gets used first, so it can displace fossil-fuel generation even when EVs aren’t charging.

A virtuous – or vicious – cycle

Our analysis reveals that what’s good for climate in the transportation sector – eliminating emissions from vehicle tailpipes – is also good for climate in the power sector, supporting more investment in clean power and displacing more fossil fuel-powered generation.

As a result, encouraging electric vehicle adoption is even better for the climate than many people expected because EV charging can actually cause lower-emitting power plants to be built.

Gasoline vehicles can’t last forever. The cheap oil will eventually run out. And EV batteries have gotten so cheap, with ranges now comparable to gas cars, that the global transition is already well underway. Even in the U.S., consumers are adopting more EVs as the technology improves and offers consumers more for less. The U.S. government can’t single-handedly stop this transition – it can only decide how much to lead, lag or resist. Rolling back electric vehicle incentives now means higher emissions, less clean energy investment and weaker U.S. competitiveness in a crucial industry of the future.

Our findings show that slowing electric vehicle adoption doesn’t just affect emissions from transportation. It also misses opportunities to help build a cleaner power sector, potentially locking the U.S. into higher emissions from its top two highest-emitting sectors – power generation and transportation – while the window to avoid the worst effects of climate change is closing.

These plants can produce enough energy to meet more than a quarter of CPS Energy’s peak demand.

The deal will save customers money in the long run, CPS Energy officials said, even with its high price tag, because it’s cheaper than building new power plants. The four facilities are relatively new and could operate for another 40 years.

“By acquiring recently constructed, currently operating modern power plants that utilize proven technology already in use by CPS Energy, we avoid higher construction costs, inflationary risk and long timelines associated with building new facilities,” said Rudy D. Garza, the utility’s president and CEO, in a statement.

Garza and other CPS Energy staff spoke more extensively about the new facilities in an interview.

The four new facilities, all between a year and four years old, have the capacity to generate a combined 1,632 megawatts per day, but they will rarely be operated simultaneously.

Adding 1,632 megawatts is significant, Ball said, but the new facilities will be used during peak periods. That means they will help cover San Antonio’s energy needs during high energy demand or emergencies.

Just one megawatt powers roughly 250 homes on a hot summer day.

CPS Energy provides electricity to San Antonio and other communities across Central Texas, roughly 5,900 megawatts during peak demand, said Elaina Ball, the utility’s chief strategy officer on Tuesday.

“They’re going to be used daily,” Ball said. “But they’re not going to be used like, say, a coal plant, which runs every day, 24/7.”

The four Houston-area facilities burn natural gas to generate electricity. This produces less carbon emissions than coal- or oil-burning power plants, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, but still produces greenhouse gas emissions.

Ball said the four new facilities could utilize more hydrogen in its natural gas, which could also reduce carbon emissions.

Buying already constructed facilities for $1.4 billion represents a significant savings, said Chief Financial Officer Cory Kuchinsky.

CPS Energy had originally budgeted $3.5 billion to expand its capacity by 1,600 megawatts, all part of a multi-year plan to modernize CPS Energy’s infrastructure, satisfy a growing population and shift away from using coal.

“We have been very very focused on executing what we call our Vision 2027 Plan,” Garza said. “We are continuously in the market for capacity.”

Kuchinsky said CPS Energy had not planned to make this large purchase and has to take on debt it did not anticipate this year to pay the $1.4 billion price tag, but that it would pay off in the long run.

Building new power plants or wind or solar farms can be expensive, takes time and carries some risk during construction, he said. Buying these completed facilities was cheaper and could save CPS Energy customers $2-4 per month over the next 25 years.

“It really is taking the long view, even though we’re issuing more debt than we planned this year, it will save consumers money in the long run,” Kuchinsky said.

It’s CPS Energy’s second major acquisition in two years. The utility bought power generation facilities in Corpus Christi and Laredo last year.",https://sanantonioreport.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Generating-Topaz-scaled.png,N,,2025-09-16 19:00:20.833977

The U.S. government is considering two proposals that would likely help farmers by requiring larger oil processors to make up for lost biofuel demand after the Trump administration earlier waived some blending requirements for small refiners.

Under one of the proposals, fuel makers would have to take 50% of the blending obligations for 2023, 2024 and 2025 that were originally assigned to small refineries granted exemptions, the Environmental Protection Agency said in a notice. The second suggests a 100% reallocation of waived requirements through additional mandated volumes during the 2026-27 period.

If adopted, either proposal would likely represent a victory for farmers, crop processors and biofuel makers and would ease concerns over demand being eroded by waivers typically granted to small refineries. Meanwhile, the measures would place additional burdens on large crude oil processors.

Shares of biofuel feedstock supplier Darling Ingredients Inc. surged as much as 10% after the news. Archer-Daniels-Midland Co. gained as much as 4%, with Bunge Global SA jumping 4.7%. Small oil processors including Delek US Holdings and CVR Energy Inc. also climbed.

The EPA will receive comments on the proposal through Oct. 31 before issuing a final decision.

In June, the EPA proposed a significant increase in the amount of biofuels that refineries need to blend into gasoline and diesel supplies. Last month, the agency granted some small oil refineries exemptions from blending mandates for 2023 and 2024.

“With this proposal, EPA acknowledges how important biofuels like ethanol are to the rural economy,” Emily Skor, the chief executive officer of biofuel trade group Growth Energy, said in a statement.

The American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers criticized the move, saying it will further increase costs for fuel makers and consumers.

“Consider EPA’s announcement a multibillion dollar-addendum to its already-historic $70 billion-per-year RFS proposal,” the group said in a statement. “Americans and U.S. refiners should not have to pay for this nonsense.”",https://www.ttnews.com/sites/default/files/styles/social_media_1200x630/public/2025-09/Refineries-1200.jpg,N,,2025-09-16 23:58:37.053606

(AP) — It seems like a terrible time to build an electric vehicle plant in the United States, but Rivian Automotive leaders say they're confident as the company starts long-delayed work on a $5 billion facility in Georgia.

The money-losing California-based company broke ground Tuesday east of Atlanta despite President Donald Trump’s successful push to roll back electric vehicle tax credits. Starting Sept. 30, buyers will no longer qualify for savings of up to $7,500 per car.

CEO RJ Scaringe said Tuesday that Rivian will sell its R2 sport utility vehicles not for environmental or tax incentive reasons, but because it's a superior vehicle.

“The description I’ll say for R2 is it isn’t an electric vehicle,"" he said. ""I describe R2 as an incredible five-passenger offroad machine. And it happens to be electric.”

Georgia plant is key to a mass market and profitability

The Georgia plant, first announced in 2021, is Rivian’s key to reaching profitability. Now the company makes the high-end R1T pickup truck and the R1S SUV in Normal, Illinois, as well as delivery vans for Amazon and others. Its truck prices start at $71,000.

The Illinois plant will begin making the smaller R2 next year, with prices starting at $45,000. An expanded Illinois plant will be able to assemble 215,000 vehicles yearly. But if the R2 is a hit, and if Rivian successfully produces an even smaller R3, it will need more capacity. Scaringe said the Georgia operation, able to make 200,000 vehicles yearly starting in 2028, is the “foundation for our growth.” Rivian plans another 200,000 in capacity in phase two, volume that would spread fixed costs over many more vehicles.

The projections would be a big leap from the 40,000 to 46,000 vehicles Rivian expects to deliver this year, down from 52,000 last year. The company says it’s limiting production in part to launch 2026 models.

“For Rivian, it’s do-or-die time,” said Alex Oyler, North American director of auto research firm SBD Automotive. “We saw with Tesla that the key to profitability is scale, and you can’t scale if your cheapest vehicle is $70,000. So they need that plant online to achieve a level of scale of R2 and ultimately R3.”

Challenges in the electric vehicle market

Sales growth is slowing for electric vehicles in the United States, rising only 1.5% in 2025's first half, according to Cox Automotive.

Tesla accounted for almost 45% of U.S. electric vehicle sales in that period, according to Cox. But the giant is losing market share as others gain: General Motors' slice of American EV sales has climbed to 13%. By comparison, Rivian had a 3% share in the first half of the year, behind Tesla and six traditional automakers.

But excluding Tesla, Rivian is the most successful startup automaker.

The company initially tapped a largely unfilled niche: demand for electric pickups and SUVs. But competition now includes Ford’s F-150 Lightning and the electric Chevrolet Silverado.

After an initial public offering in 2021, Rivian shares have fallen by more than 80%, while automaker shares overall have outpaced the broader stock market. Rivian lost $1.66 billion in 2025’s first half.

At the same time, some automakers’ ardor for electric vehicles is cooling. Stellantis last week canceled Ram’s electric truck program. Ford has delayed production at a new Tennessee plant. And General Motors abandoned plans to build electric vehicles in suburban Detroit.

“With all the competition out there in this market and the slowing growth of EVs, it does not play in Rivian’s favor,” said Sam Fiorani, a vice president at AutoForecast Solutions. “However, there still is an EV market out there.”

$1.5 billion in incentives for 7,500 jobs

Georgia has pledged $1.5 billion of incentives to Rivian in exchange for 7,500 company jobs paying at least $56,000 a year on average. Rivian can’t benefit from most incentives unless it meets employment goals, but the state is already spending $175 million to buy and grade land and improve roads.

Georgia Republican Gov. Brian Kemp, says he wants to make Georgia “the electric mobility capital of America,” but acknowledged Tuesday that “the road to get here has not been smooth.” He voiced confidence that Rivian can deliver “an innovation revolution” benefitting Georgians.

While Tesla has thousands of employees in California and Texas, some new electric vehicle plants have sputtered. Two separate EV makers that hoped to assemble vehicles in a former GM plant in Lordstown, Ohio, went bankrupt. Georgia’s Hyundai complex near Savannah is faring better, with production underway. However, a battery plant there has been delayed by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement arresting 475 people on site, including more than 300 South Koreans.

Rivian was supposed to be making trucks by now at the 2,000-acre (800-hectare) site near Social Circle, about 45 miles (70 kilometers) east of Atlanta. As the company burned through cash in 2024, it paused construction. But German automaker Volkswagen agreed to invest $5.8 billion in Rivian in exchange for software and electrical technology. And then-President Joe Biden's administration agreed to loan Rivian $6.6 billion to build the Georgia plant.

Despite the Trump administration's hostility toward EVs, Scaringe said Tuesday that Rivian has built “a very close relationship” with the U.S. Department of Energy and that the company's goals align with some of Trump's big ones, including “U.S. manufacturing, U.S. technology, U.S. technology that supports global business, and leading in all those areas.”

Kemp said he has urged Energy Secretary Chris Wright to back Rivian.

Some neighbors still oppose the plant

Rivian also faces opposition from some residents who say the plant is an inappropriate neighbor to farms and will pollute the groundwater.

“I planned on dying and retiring on the front porch and the biggest project in Georgia has to go next door to me, of all places in the country?” asked Eddie Clay, who lives less than a mile away. He says his well water turned mud-choked after excavation at the Rivian site.

There are other challenges for Rivian, including tariffs costing $2,000 per vehicle, the Trump administration ending a tax-credit program that will cost the company $140 million in revenue this year, and long-term threats from low-priced, cutting-edge Chinese EVs. But Scaringe said the start of construction shows Rivian is working through its challenges.

“These are not the kinds of things you start without having clear sight to be able to fully finish and launch,” he said.

More than 40 Garfield County residents got behind the wheel of the latest electric vehicles (EVs) at the EV Roadshow, experiencing firsthand the smooth, quiet ride. The joy on drivers’ faces was contagious, especially when driving the lime green Volkswagen ID Buzz — a take on the iconic Volkswagen Vanagon.

Garfield County is a great place to own an EV. More than 1,600 EVs cruise along our roads and charging gets easier by the day with more than 150 charging ports throughout the county. That’s 15 Level-2 ports per vehicle. Find a charger close to home and on the road through PlugShare .

Then there are the financial and emissions benefits: EVs have about 50% lower long-term maintenance costs and cost 60% less to fuel . Plus, they provide a fun driving experience with quick acceleration, easy handling and zero tailpipe emissions.

And with big changes coming to federal and state incentives, including the expiration of the $7,500 federal tax credit on Sept. 30, 2025, now is the perfect time to explore what EV ownership could look like for you. Rebates may be shifting, but EVs aren’t going anywhere. For those of us working in clean transportation, the message is simple: the future is still electric.

What you need to know about federal and state rebates

The federal tax credit for new and used EVs only applies to a subset of vehicles. The car must meet certain manufacturing and battery sourcing requirements to qualify . Some manufacturers have eligible models, and some dealerships offer a $7,500 discount to make up for vehicles that don’t qualify for the federal tax credit. If you’re interested in making the switch, meet the income requirements and have your eye on an EV on the FuelEconomy.gov list, now is the time to act.

Colorado has additional EV incentives that won’t expire at the end of this month. They can be stacked on top of the federal tax credit while it lasts. State incentives include $3,500 for any EV with an MSRP under $80,000 and a bonus $2,500 for an EV with an MSRP under $35,000. However, the base incentive of $3,500 for any EV is decreasing to $750 at the end of 2025.

Another rebate to consider is Colorado’s Vehicle Exchange Colorado (VXC) program . It offers a stackable $6,000 rebate for new cars and $4,000 for used ones. To qualify, your current gas car must be at least twelve years old or fail a Colorado emissions test. Participants also must have an income below 80% of the area median income and work with a participating dealership like Bighorn Toyota, Glenwood Springs Ford, Mountain Chevrolet, Phil Long Glenwood Springs Subaru and Columbine Ford. VXC rebates are increasing on October 1st to $9,000 (new) and $6,000 (used) to offer some relief as the federal tax credits expire. The VXC rebate is generally applied at the point of sale, whether that is on your lease, monthly payment or cash cost.

How to get started

Buying a car can be complicated. Start with an EV finder tool to see what’s available. Then, work with a dealership to ensure your vehicle is eligible for incentives and where they’re applied. Many dealerships prefer to apply the federal and Colorado tax credits to financing or lease monthly payments (some leases are as low as $99 a month). If you are looking to purchase a vehicle to own, you may have to apply for the tax credit incentives on your taxes.

Or, participate in one of several more EV Roadshows with workshops and test drives in the region throughout September and October, including an informational session in Glenwood Springs on Oct. 16. EV enthusiasts and the EV curious can attend these upcoming events to discuss and ask questions about electrifying fleets, charging at multifamily housing, rebates and incentives, and vehicle models.

The agenda reflects the administration’s objective of rolling back US Environmental Protection Agency rules the administration perceives as burdensome to industry, hindering economic growth, and stifling innovation and competition, but it also introduces new proposed regulations, identifies ongoing environmental regulatory efforts, and retains some Biden-era proposals.

The proposed actions of the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in the Spring 2025 Unified Agenda of Regulatory and Deregulatory Actions (Unified Agenda) are broad, touching upon areas of climate, air, water, and chemicals (including per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS)) under nearly all major environmental statutory and permitting regimes. These actions are expected to have significant and far-reaching impacts on the nation’s environmental regulatory landscape and on regulated communities. Several notable aspects of the agenda are discussed herein.

CLIMATE AND AIR REGULATIONS

Greenhouse Gas Endangerment Finding

EPA expects to issue a final rule in September to repeal the 2009 Greenhouse Gas (GHG) endangerment finding, the landmark Obama-era finding that the combined atmospheric concentrations of six greenhouse gases constitute ""air pollution which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health and welfare.” The endangerment finding has been foundational to EPA’s regulatory approach to GHGs, acting as the legal basis for EPA’s regulation of GHGs, and directly influenced climate-related policy and litigation.

The proposed rule to repeal the endangerment finding was first published in July 2025, with the public comment period closing on September 22, 2025. The Unified Agenda reflects EPA’s objective to finalize that rulemaking this month.

Greenhouse Gas Reporting

The White House is actively reviewing proposals to reduce annual greenhouse gas reporting requirements for various industrial sectors, including power plants, oil refineries, coal mines, and manufacturers of petrochemicals, cement, glass, iron and steel. The reporting rule for non-oil-and-gas sectors is currently under review by the White House, and a final rule is anticipated in November 2025.

Emissions Standards

EPA announced a slew of planned national emission standards-related deregulatory actions, from compliance deadline extensions to relaxed emissions standards, that will impact a number of sectors and industries, including oil and gas, waste management, manufacturing, agriculture, chemicals, tire and rubber manufacturing, and commercial sterilization sectors, among others.

Relaxed rules affecting the oil and gas sector from the previous administration—including regulations for methane and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from the oil and gas sector, revisions to the GHG Reporting Program Subpart W, and the Waste Emissions Charge in the Inflation Reduction Act—appear in the Unified Agenda. The Unified Agenda further includes intended air toxics emissions standards rollbacks for ethylene oxide (EtO), mercury, hydrogen chloride, and hydrogen fluoride.

Cross-State Emissions

EPA intends to replace the now-defunct Biden-era 2023 “Good Neighbor” plan, which aimed to limit smog-forming emissions that cross state lines under the 2015 ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards, with a new two-step process. The “Good Neighbor” program intended to require 23 states to reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) from power plants and other industrial sources to help downwind states achieve air quality standards for ozone. The Trump EPA believes that the 2023 rule impermissibly expanded federal rules to states and sectors “beyond the program’s traditional focus and led to the rejection of nearly all State Implementation Plans.”

EPA will also replace a stricter annual soot standard issued under the Biden administration. A final version of the relaxed standard is expected in February 2026, with a proposed rule expected in the fall.

WATER RULES

EPA identified sweeping rollbacks of various Biden-era Clean Water Act (CWA) rules that will impact a wide array of industries, including coal-fired power generators, steel mills, copper smelters, lime manufacturers, and bulk gasoline terminals.

Coal Power Plant Rules

EPA plans to revise a rule issued under the Biden administration that required coal power plants to install more advanced water pollution controls, with a proposed rule expected in November. Under the previous administration, EPA required power plant owners to virtually eliminate heavy metals and other harmful pollutants from three major waste streams through the installation of new technologies. Regulated entities had until 2029 to comply, or notify EPA by December 31, 2025 that they would permanently stop burning coal by 2034. The current EPA plans to extend those deadlines.

Waters of the United States (WOTUS) Rule

A proposed rule narrowing the scope of the CWA would restrict the types of water bodies regulated under the act and is expected to limit federal regulation of wetlands and small streams. Until a final rule is implemented or additional action taken, EPA and the US Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) continue to follow the EPA and Corps’ joint March 2025 interim guidance regarding the definition of “waters of the United States.”

Section 401 Revision

EPA is also expected to roll back requirements under CWA Section 401, which requires applicants for a federal permit that may result in a discharge to “waters of the United States” to obtain a certification from the relevant state or tribe that the discharge will comply with state water quality standards. According to the agenda, the Clean Water Act Section 401 Water Quality Certification Improvement Rule will “increase transparency, efficiency, and predictability” for states and energy companies seeking permits. The proposed rule is expected in December 2025.

RELAXED PFAS RULES

The US Administration is expected to pursue a number of Biden-era policies impacting PFAS, or “forever chemicals.” Plans are underway to finalize CWA regulations for monitoring and reporting PFAS in wastewater discharges, as well as to finalize effluent limitation guidelines (ELGs) for chemical manufacturers. Other rules are expected to be narrowed and deadlines extended.

Safe Drinking Water Act

As previously announced by the agency, EPA is expected to retain the enforceable four parts per trillion maximum contaminant levels (MCLs) for perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) under the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA). However, it will propose a rule by October 2025 to extend the compliance deadline for water systems by an additional two years, with a final rule expected by April 2026.

EPA also intends to propose a rule in September 2025 to withdraw its regulatory determinations to regulate four PFAS (perfluorohexane sulfonic acid (PFHxS), perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer acid and its ammonium salt (HFPO-DA, commonly known as GenX), and the mixture of these three PFAS plus perfluorobutane sulfonic acid (PFBS)) under the SDWA, and to rescind all associated regulatory provisions. This rule is expected to be finalized by February 2026.

The Unified Agenda also includes plans to finalize two Biden-era Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) PFAS rules, as well as a rule that would add 16 individual PFAS and 15 PFAS categories to the TRI.

EPA is also eyeing a more relaxed PFAS TSCA Section 8(a)(7) reporting rule. On August 9, it submitted the “Perfluoroalkyl and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) Data Reporting and Recordkeeping under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA); Revision to Regulation” to the US Office of Management and Budget. The rule aims to roll back a Biden-era PFAS reporting regulation under TSCA that required manufacturers and importers to submit information on their PFAS production volumes, disposal, exposures and hazards as far back as 2011, for both chemicals and articles.

EPA plans to propose a rule in December 2025 to incorporate “certain exemptions and other modifications to the scope of the [TSCA PFAS] reporting rule,” which is expected to be finalized by June 2026. EPA also delayed the start of the reporting period, which will now begin on April 13, 2026 and end on October 13, 2026 for most regulated parties. EPA cited the need to prepare the Central Data Exchange (CDX) reporting system as the reason behind the delayed reporting requirement.

The Unified Agenda also includes proposals to finalize the pending rules for regulation of nine PFAS as “hazardous constituents” under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), together with the associated rule definition amendments (to modify the regulations to confirm with the statutory definitions and EPA practice), both by April 2026. Notably absent from the Unified Agenda is any reference to rulemaking relating to the designation of PFOA and PFOS as hazardous substances under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act. Refer to our May 16 LawFlash for more information about EPA’s PFAS agenda.

IMPLICATIONS

The Unified Agenda is largely deregulatory and underscores this administration’s actions to support US industry, with initial counts indicating EPA has the fourth most deregulatory actions of all federal agencies. EPA’s Unified Agenda items largely align with prior deregulatory announcements from EPA since January and are in line with various environmental and energy executive orders signed by the president during his first weeks in office aimed at unleashing US energy, lowering the cost of living for US families, and advancing cooperative federalism. Some of the new proposed rules included in the Unified Agenda also are deregulatory in nature because they seek to reverse prior rulemakings through the rulemaking process.

Rollbacks of EPA regulations, such as the Section 401 revision and narrowed WOTUS rule, will result in both the streamlining of the federal permitting process through the reversal or elimination of permitting hurdles and the need for fewer required federal permits. Fewer restrictions on air emissions and water discharges will ease regulatory burdens on all manner of industry, including stationary energy generation sources such as power plants and mobile sources, including vehicles and aircraft. Relaxed endangered species protections and eased leasing requirements are also expected to hasten domestic energy exploration and production.[1]

In all, these identified actions, which include completed, ongoing, and long-term rulemakings (i.e., those anticipated to be on a 12-month time horizon or longer), will have a resounding impact across industries. It will be imperative for stakeholders and members of the regulated communities to continue to monitor regulatory developments and related rulemaking activities. Interested parties should also take notice of stated rulemaking timelines included in the Unified Agenda, as these proposed deadlines (while not set in stone) are instructional. It can also be expected that these actions will spur challenges and litigation. Stakeholders should consider options for participation in the rulemaking process, such as through direct submission of comments in response to the rulemaking, or indirect participation through industry groups or other channels.

(AP) — It seems like a terrible time to build an electric vehicle plant in the United States, but Rivian Automotive leaders say they’re confident as the company starts long-delayed work on a $5 billion facility in Georgia.

The money-losing California-based company broke ground Tuesday east of Atlanta despite President Donald Trump’s successful push to roll back electric vehicle tax credits. Starting Sept. 30, buyers will no longer qualify for savings of up to $7,500 per car.

CEO RJ Scaringe said Tuesday that Rivian will sell its R2 sport utility vehicles not for environmental or tax incentive reasons, but because it’s a superior vehicle.

“The description I’ll say for R2 is it isn’t an electric vehicle,” he said. “I describe R2 as an incredible five-passenger offroad machine. And it happens to be electric.”

Georgia plant is key to a mass market and profitability

The Georgia plant, first announced in 2021, is Rivian’s key to reaching profitability. Now the company makes the high-end R1T pickup truck and the R1S SUV in Normal, Illinois, as well as delivery vans for Amazon and others. Its truck prices start at $71,000.

The Illinois plant will begin making the smaller R2 next year, with prices starting at $45,000. An expanded Illinois plant will be able to assemble 215,000 vehicles yearly. But if the R2 is a hit, and if Rivian successfully produces an even smaller R3, it will need more capacity. Scaringe said the Georgia operation, able to make 200,000 vehicles yearly starting in 2028, is the “foundation for our growth.” Rivian plans another 200,000 in capacity in phase two, volume that would spread fixed costs over many more vehicles.

The projections would be a big leap from the 40,000 to 46,000 vehicles Rivian expects to deliver this year, down from 52,000 last year. The company says it’s limiting production in part to launch 2026 models.

“For Rivian, it’s do-or-die time,” said Alex Oyler, North American director of auto research firm SBD Automotive. “We saw with Tesla that the key to profitability is scale, and you can’t scale if your cheapest vehicle is $70,000. So they need that plant online to achieve a level of scale of R2 and ultimately R3.”

Challenges in the electric vehicle market

Sales growth is slowing for electric vehicles in the United States, rising only 1.5% in 2025’s first half, according to Cox Automotive.

Tesla accounted for almost 45% of U.S. electric vehicle sales in that period, according to Cox. But the giant is losing market share as others gain: General Motors’ slice of American EV sales has climbed to 13%. By comparison, Rivian had a 3% share in the first half of the year, behind Tesla and six traditional automakers.

But excluding Tesla, Rivian is the most successful startup automaker.

The company initially tapped a largely unfilled niche: demand for electric pickups and SUVs. But competition now includes Ford’s F-150 Lightning and the electric Chevrolet Silverado.

After an initial public offering in 2021, Rivian shares have fallen by more than 80%, while automaker shares overall have outpaced the broader stock market. Rivian lost $1.66 billion in 2025’s first half.

At the same time, some automakers’ ardor for electric vehicles is cooling. Stellantis last week canceled Ram’s electric truck program. Ford has delayed production at a new Tennessee plant. And General Motors abandoned plans to build electric vehicles in suburban Detroit.

“With all the competition out there in this market and the slowing growth of EVs, it does not play in Rivian’s favor,” said Sam Fiorani, a vice president at AutoForecast Solutions. “However, there still is an EV market out there.”

$1.5 billion in incentives for 7,500 jobs

Georgia has pledged $1.5 billion of incentives to Rivian in exchange for 7,500 company jobs paying at least $56,000 a year on average. Rivian can’t benefit from most incentives unless it meets employment goals, but the state is already spending $175 million to buy and grade land and improve roads.

Georgia Republican Gov. Brian Kemp, says he wants to make Georgia “the electric mobility capital of America,” but acknowledged Tuesday that “the road to get here has not been smooth.” He voiced confidence that Rivian can deliver “an innovation revolution” benefitting Georgians.

While Tesla has thousands of employees in California and Texas, some new electric vehicle plants have sputtered. Two separate EV makers that hoped to assemble vehicles in a former GM plant in Lordstown, Ohio, went bankrupt. Georgia’s Hyundai complex near Savannah is faring better, with production underway. However, a battery plant there has been delayed by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement arresting 475 people on site, including more than 300 South Koreans.

Rivian was supposed to be making trucks by now at the 2,000-acre (800-hectare) site near Social Circle, about 45 miles (70 kilometers) east of Atlanta. As the company burned through cash in 2024, it paused construction. But German automaker Volkswagen agreed to invest $5.8 billion in Rivian in exchange for software and electrical technology. And then-President Joe Biden’s administration agreed to loan Rivian $6.6 billion to build the Georgia plant.

Despite the Trump administration’s hostility toward EVs, Scaringe said Tuesday that Rivian has built “a very close relationship” with the U.S. Department of Energy and that the company’s goals align with some of Trump’s big ones, including “U.S. manufacturing, U.S. technology, U.S. technology that supports global business, and leading in all those areas.”

Kemp said he has urged Energy Secretary Chris Wright to back Rivian.

Some neighbors still oppose the plant

Rivian also faces opposition from some residents who say the plant is an inappropriate neighbor to farms and will pollute the groundwater.

“I planned on dying and retiring on the front porch and the biggest project in Georgia has to go next door to me, of all places in the country?” asked Eddie Clay, who lives less than a mile away. He says his well water turned mud-choked after excavation at the Rivian site.

There are other challenges for Rivian, including tariffs costing $2,000 per vehicle, the Trump administration ending a tax-credit program that will cost the company $140 million in revenue this year, and long-term threats from low-priced, cutting-edge Chinese EVs. But Scaringe said the start of construction shows Rivian is working through its challenges.

“These are not the kinds of things you start without having clear sight to be able to fully finish and launch,” he said.

Dive Brief:

California lawmakers approved a sweeping energy package at the end of the legislative session that does not include funding to continue two grid reliability programs, including a virtual power plant advocates believe is the largest in the world.

Earlier this year, the state faced a $12 billion budget shortfall, and the two programs were in limbo for months as legislators negotiated down to the wire. The bills awaiting Gov. Gavin Newsom’s signature after the session closed Saturday include proposals aimed at bringing down energy costs, expanding the Western grid and codifying virtual power plants in longterm planning.

Advocates say gutting the Demand Side Grid Support and Distributed Electricity Backup Assets programs threatens to undermine the state’s progress toward a more resilient grid that can respond to system stress by calling on batteries, electric vehicles, rooftop solar panels, smart thermostats and other energy resources that are increasingly common in homes, businesses and institutions.

Dive Insight:

Legislators created DSGS and DEBA in 2022 to try to improve reliability and avoid blackouts during emergencies. At one time, they were slated to receive nearly a billion dollars in state funds.

Kate Unger, senior policy advisor for the California Solar and Storage Association, said the DSGS program alone has more than one gigawatt of enrolled capacity, of which about 750 MW is batteries. The program is run by the California Energy Commission and offers customers, utilities and/or aggregators compensation in exchange for allowing their resources to be dispatched at times of grid stress.

A test event in July saw more than 500 MW of battery energy dispatched to the grid for two hours.

“I think we’re at a point now where I can actually see the program come to a grinding halt,” said Unger. “There appears to be a risk that DSGS providers and customers could participate in 2026 and not get paid.”

A study by The Brattle Group, commissioned by Sunrun and Tesla Energy, both of which participate in the DSGS program, concluded that the taxpayer-funded virtual power plant could reduce the need for gas peaker plants and has the potential to save ratepayers $206 million between 2025 and 2028.

After several rounds of appropriations and clawbacks, the programs had been expected to receive more than $400 million through at least 2028, funded primarily from California’s Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, which is funded by its cap and trade program.

Their fate, however, rested on the reauthorization of the cap and trade program, which was the centerpiece of a sprawling energy package that Newsom pushed through. The legislature passed a bill reauthorizing cap and trade and rebranding it as “cap and invest,” but without the grid reliability funding.

Edson Perez, senior principal at Advanced Energy United, expressed disappointment that the programs seemed to have been left on the cutting room floor amid intense negotiations and budget constraints.

“It just went into the black box of negotiations,” he said. “It is a huge missed opportunity.”

Perez said overall, reauthorizing cap and trade was a “great achievement” and he expressed hope that legislators would find another way to fund the grid reliability programs early next year.

“The Governor is steadfast in his commitment to building a more reliable, affordable, clean and safe power grid that can serve the evolving needs of millions of Californians in a hotter, drier climate,” a spokesperson for Newsom wrote in an email. “The reality is that California has rapidly deployed thousands of new megawatts in recent years meaning our grid is more resilient than it’s ever been.”",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/aij2CMW1E8FkQdp412zuJqTQmItFCxvCG0WleahOMCI/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0yMjE4NDgyNDIxLmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-09-16 18:00:44.678197

Known as the Clean Vehicle Credit , the benefit provides a tax discount of up to $7,500 for a new electric car, and up to $4,000 for a used one. It expires on Sept. 30.

The tax credit was approved as part of the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022 and initially set to last through 2032. That timeline was cut short, however, by Congress’ recent tax and spending-cut law, known as the “one big, beautiful bill,” which is also winding down several other tax incentives for clean-energy home upgrades.

The electric vehicle credits are income-based. For a new car, the benefit applies to people whose adjusted gross income is no more than $150,000 or $225,000 for heads-of-household. For joint tax filers, they must make no more than $300,000 to use the credit.

For used vehicles, the income thresholds are $75,000 for individuals, $122,500 for heads-of-household, and $150,000 for joint filers.

The vehicles must also meet certain requirements. For new cars, that includes having a battery capacity of at least seven kilowatt hours and having undergone final assembly in North America. For used vehicles, the car’s sale price cannot exceed $25,000, not including taxes or title and registration fees, along with other requirements.

While the federal incentive ends on Sept. 30, Colorado will continue offering a state-level tax credit for electric vehicles, though the benefit will be considerably smaller next year.

Currently, the state’s base tax credit is worth $3,500, but that will decrease to $750 starting on Jan. 1, 2026.

Water for the center will be provided by the Racine Water Utility under an agreement with the village of Mount Pleasant.
Community members have a right to know how much water a data center will use before it is built.”","Two environmental groups are warning state residents about the amount of energy and water that is set to be used following the construction of AI data centers in southern Wisconsin.

In an analysis released Tuesday, Clean Wisconsin found that two data centers approved for construction in Ozaukee and Racine counties will consume enough energy to power 4.3 million homes — nearly double the 2.8 million housing units in the state.

The first AI data warehouse, operated by Microsoft, is set to open next year in Mount Pleasant. The company has promised it will support 500 jobs. The $3.3 billion project is located at the site initially planned for Foxconn’s massive manufacturing plant.

Further north in Ozaukee County, Denver-based Vantage Data Systems has acquired 700 acres of land in rural Port Washington. The company has planned a campus that will hold 11 data center buildings and five substations, according to concepts approved by the local government.

Clean Wisconsin’s analysis found that these two projects will require a combined 3.9 gigawatts of power and hundreds of thousands of gallons of water to keep the buildings cooled.

“To put this in perspective, that is more than three times the power production capacity of Wisconsin’s Point Beach nuclear plant,” Paul Mathewson, Clean Wisconsin science program director, who conducted the analysis, said in a statement. “And because only two of the data center projects have disclosed their power needs, we know this is really just a fraction of what the energy use would be if all those data centers are ultimately built.”

The power needs of the two sites are just the tip of the iceberg for the energy and water needs of data centers, which house the servers used to host chatbots such as Chat GPT, stream video and use social media. Microsoft has plans for a smaller data center in Kenosha County. Work is also underway on a data center on 830 acres in Beaver Dam reportedly for Facebook owner Meta. In addition, a Virginia-based company has eyed a site in Dane County, Wisconsin Rapids has plans for a $200 million data center and Janesville is seeking to build a center in a former General Motors assembly plant.

A proposed project in Caledonia has been delayed following local resistance to the project’s proposed rezoning of 240 acres of farmland. The community’s plan commission postponed a July vote on the proposal until later this month.

Environmental advocates say local officials and the state’s power companies are rushing to attract data centers to Wisconsin based on the ambiguous promise of jobs without accounting for the effect they could have on a community’s water sources and energy needs. Increases in the amount of power used by the state could result in the state relying more heavily and for longer periods on non-renewable sources of energy and raise energy rates for households.

‘More questions than answers’

“If data centers come to Wisconsin, they must benefit — not harm — our communities. But right now, we have far more questions than answers about their impacts. How much energy and water will a project use? How will those demands be met? Will there be backup diesel generators on site and how often will they be fired up for testing? Our communities don’t have the transparency they need and deserve,” Chelsea Chandler, Clean Wisconsin’s climate, energy and air director said.

Data centers also often emit a constant humming sound as the servers work inside, creating an irritating noise pollutant for neighbors.

Both the Mount Pleasant and Port Washington projects are close to Lake Michigan, raising further complications about the centers’ use of water and the protection of the Great Lakes. The Foxconn site in Mount Pleasant was already at the center of a controversial plan to divert 7 million gallons of water per day from Lake Michigan.

“There has been very little transparency about the amount of water that will be used on site at these proposed data center campuses. Add to that a lack of transparency about energy use, and it’s impossible to know what the impact on Wisconsin’s water resources will be,” Sarah Walling, Clean Wisconsin’s water and agriculture program director said. “Communities need to know what the on-site demand will be on the hottest, driest days of the year when our water systems are most stressed. And we need to understand how much water will be needed off site to meet a data center’s enormous energy demands.”

Demanding water-use information from Racine

Earlier this week, Midwest Environmental Advocates filed a lawsuit against the city of Racine for records about the Mount Pleasant center’s projected water usage. Water for the center will be provided by the Racine Water Utility under an agreement with the village of Mount Pleasant.

The lawsuit, filed on behalf of Milwaukee Riverkeeper, is seeking to force Racine to hand over information about projected water usage requested through an open records request in February. In a news release, MEA noted that many companies constructing data centers across the country require that local governments sign non-disclosure agreements.

The legal advocacy group noted that data centers can use as much water as a small to medium sized city and the public has a right to know the scale of water use.

“Wisconsin law requires public officials to respond to public records requests ‘as soon as practicable and without delay.’ Yet more than six months after making their request, our clients are still waiting,” MEA legal fellow Michael Greif said. “This blatant disregard for the Public Records Law violates their rights and deprives them of the transparency they deserve. Community members have a right to know how much water a data center will use before it is built.”",https://wisconsinexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/nj-powerlines.jpg,N,,2025-09-16 18:00:25.006175

Credits phase out sooner for wind, solar, and certain manufacturing components, so consider accelerated construction and financing schedules.","I. Background

On July 4, 2025, President Trump signed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) into law, marking a significant turn in US clean energy policy. The new law dismantles or narrows many of the clean energy tax credits introduced under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA). For developers, manufacturers, and investors, the message is clear: access to federal tax credits is shrinking, and the rules for eligibility are tightening.

Days after signing the OBBBA, on July 7, President Trump reinforced this policy shift with an executive order (EO 14315) directing federal agencies to end support for wind, solar, and other “green” technologies. Treasury was tasked with enforcing accelerated deadlines and stricter rules to prevent projects from using safe harbors to lock in credits for wind and solar. Together, the OBBBA and EO 14315 set the stage for a new framework that scales back incentives and imposes tougher compliance hurdles, particularly around foreign ownership and supply chain sourcing.

II. New IRS Guidance: “Beginning of Construction” Rules

The IRS acted quickly, following EO 14315 with Notice 2025-42, which provides new rules addressing when wind and solar projects are considered to have “begun construction” for purposes of qualifying for the production tax credit (PTC) and investment tax credit (ITC) under Sections 45Y and 48E, respectively.[1] This notice significantly narrows the pathways available to developers.

The familiar “5% safe harbor” introduced under Notice 2013-29 and further clarified under various IRS notices, such as Notice 2018-59 and Notice 2022-61 (Prior Notices), is eliminated for most wind and solar projects. Instead, taxpayers must now satisfy the “physical work test,” which requires that physical work of a significant nature begins before July 5, 2026. That said, the 5% safe harbor is preserved for small-scale solar projects (1.5 MW or less), recognizing the unique challenges for distributed generation.

Qualifying work under the physical work test can include on-site activities such as excavation for wind turbine foundations or installation of racking for solar panels, as well as certain off-site manufacturing activities performed pursuant to binding written contracts. Preliminary steps like permitting or site clearing are not counted toward the physical work test.

Once construction begins, projects must maintain a continuous program of construction (i.e., the “continuity requirement”). That said, the “continuity safe harbor” from the Prior Notices still exists. If a project is placed in service within four years of the end of the year in which construction began, the project is treated as having satisfied the continuity requirement. If the construction period extends beyond the four-year safe harbor, a solar developer can no longer rely on merely showing “continuous efforts” but must be able to demonstrate a continuous program of construction that involves continuing physical work of a significant nature.

Fortunately, Notice 2025-42 preserves a list of excusable disruptions, such as weather, interconnection delays, and permitting delays, for purposes of satisfying the continuity requirement.

Finally, it is worth noting that Notice 2025-42 specially provides that the “beginning of construction” rules set forth in the notice are not intended to address the “beginning of construction” rules for purposes of determining whether a project is subject to the new restrictions on foreign involvement discussed below. Such guidance is currently being prepared by Treasury.

For developers, the takeaway is clear: simply incurring costs or securing contracts will no longer be sufficient. Projects must demonstrate physical progress of a significant nature on or before the July 4, 2026 deadline to remain eligible for PTCs or ITCs without being subject to the accelerated December 31, 2027 placed-in-service deadline.

III. Change Under the OBBBA

New Restrictions on Foreign Involvement

A central feature of the OBBBA is the creation of the Prohibited Foreign Entity (PFE) regime. The goal is to limit foreign influence in the US clean energy sector, especially from countries deemed adversarial to the United States, such as China, Russia, North Korea, and Iran.

The rules operate on two levels:

Specified Foreign Entities (SFEs): entities directly tied to adversarial governments or named in laws like the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act.

Foreign-Influenced Entities (FIEs): entities where an SFE has significant influence, such as owning at least 25%, holding certain debt interests, or having contractual control.

Even if a developer isn’t itself an SFE or FIE, projects can still lose eligibility if (1) they begin construction after December 31, 2025, and (2) they rely too heavily on goods or services sourced from PFEs. Treasury will measure this through a “material assistance” test, which compares overall project costs with the portion tied to PFEs. The thresholds will tighten overtime — wind and solar projects must show 40% non-PFE content in 2026, rising to 60% by 2030. Similar rules will apply across technologies, from batteries to inverters to critical minerals.

While official safe harbor tables won’t arrive until late 2026, transitional relief allows developers to rely on IRS Notice 2025-08 and supplier certifications in the meantime. Developers will need to closely track supply chains now, as eligibility will become progressively harder to maintain. As noted above, the “beginning of construction” rules under Notice 2025-42 for purposes of determining whether a project is eligible for PTCs or ITCs are not intended to address the “beginning of construction” rules for purposes of determining whether a project is subject to the “material assistance” restrictions. Until Treasury issues specific guidance, the historic “beginning of construction” rules remain applicable for this purpose.

Key Changes by Credit

Investment Tax Credit (Section 48E): Wind and solar face early termination deadlines — in order to be eligible for this credit, construction must begin on or before July 4, 2026, or, for projects beginning construction after July 4, 2026, such projects must be placed in service by the end of 2027. As discussed earlier, Notice 2025-42 introduced new rules on when wind and solar projects are considered to have begun construction, which further narrows eligibility. That said, other technologies like geothermal, nuclear, and hydrogen retain longer timelines, with a gradual phaseout starting in 2034.

Production Tax Credits (Section 45Y): Similarly, wind and solar projects must meet the July 4, 2026 “beginning of construction” date or the December 31, 2027 placed-in-service deadline. Other technologies, such as geothermal, hydrogen, and nuclear projects, are subject to the same phaseout schedule as the Section 48E ITCs.

Advanced Manufacturing Production Credits (Section 45X): Wind components produced and sold after December 31, 2027 are ineligible for the Section 45X credit. With respect to critical minerals, the OBBBA (1) included metallurgical coal as an applicable critical mineral, and (2) provided for a critical mineral phaseout beginning in 2031 (except for metallurgical coal, which phases out beginning in 2030). In addition, the OBBBA tightened the definition of “battery modules” eligible for the Section 45X credit by clarifying that a battery module is comprised of all other essential equipment needed for battery functionality. The PFE rules also apply here, forcing manufacturers to reevaluate sourcing strategies.

Carbon Oxide Sequestration Credit (Section 45Q): Credit amounts are equalized at $17 per ton (base) for carbon captured from industrial and power facilities (increased to $85 per ton if the prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements are satisfied) and $36 per ton (base) for direct air capture (increased to $180 per ton if the prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements are satisfied), regardless of end use. But PFE restrictions will now limit who can claim or transfer the Section 45Q credits.

Zero-Emission Nuclear Power Production Credit (Section 45U): The Section 45U credit for electricity production at existing nuclear power plants that were operational at the time of enactment of the IRA (i.e., placed in service prior to August 16, 2022) remains intact through 2032, but with new restrictions on sourcing nuclear fuel from covered nations. Specifically, after December 31, 2027, taxpayers must certify that any nuclear fuel was not sourced from covered nations or “covered entities” (unless pursuant to a binding contract in force prior to January 1, 2023). In addition, SFEs are not eligible to claim the Section 45U credit after the date of enactment of the OBBBA, and FIEs cannot claim the Section 45U credit for tax year beginning after the second anniversary of the date of enactment.

Clean Hydrogen Production Credit (Section 45V): Eligibility for the per kilogram credit for qualified clean hydrogen production now requires construction to begin before 2028, significantly shortening the runway for new projects. Projects beginning construction after December 31, 2027, will no longer be eligible.

Clean Production Fuel Credit (Section 45Z): The Section 45Z credit for the production of certain transportation fuel and sustainable aviation fuel has been extended and is available through 2029, but with narrowed eligibility and stricter sourcing rules. PFE restrictions also apply. For example, for fuel produced after December 31, 2025, the enhanced rate for sustainable aviation fuel is no longer available and the credit value for fuels derived from foreign feedstocks would be reduced by 20%.

Direct Pay and Transferability (Sections 6417 and 6418): Both remain available, but credits cannot be transferred to PFEs (immediately for SFEs and two years later for FIEs).

IV. Looking Ahead

The OBBBA fundamentally reshapes clean energy incentives by accelerating phaseouts, shortening deadlines, and layering in complex new foreign entity restrictions. While certain technologies like nuclear and hydrogen retain more favorable treatment, the overarching trend is a sharp contraction in federal support for wind, solar, and PFE-linked projects.

Below is a list of action items for developers to do now:

Move quickly on project starts. Wind and solar developers must begin construction on or before July 4, 2026 to preserve credit eligibility while retaining the four-year “continuity safe harbor” to place the project in service; otherwise, such projects that begin construction after the first anniversary of the enactment of the OBBBA have to be placed in service by the end of 2027.

Focus on the Physical Work Test. For wind and solar projects, developers can no longer “begin construction” by satisfying a 5% safe harbor (other than certain small-scale solar projects of 1.5 MW or less). Paying or incurring costs for the manufacturing of project components is no longer enough — developers must plan for tangible, qualifying construction steps that constitute physical work of a significant nature, both for purposes of showing that construction began and for purposes of maintaining a continuous program of construction.

Track supply chains. The introduction of the PFE regime intended to limit foreign influence in the US clean energy sector means that developers and manufacturers must strengthen the supplier due diligence process and carefully document sourcing of key inputs to ensure no impermissible material assistance and build strategies to reduce foreign exposure.

Plan for shorter timelines. Credits phase out sooner for wind, solar, and certain manufacturing components, so consider accelerated construction and financing schedules.

Monitor Treasury guidance. Future notices (including notices regarding the PFE regime and the beginning of construction rules for the PFE regime) will shape enforcement and safe harbor rules; staying up to date will be critical to avoid disqualification.

In this new era, careful planning and compliance will be essential to securing clean energy tax incentives, and maintaining strong documentation will be key to supporting credit eligibility and ensuring investors and tax credit purchasers that the underlying credits are secure. Please reach out to Gregg M. Benson or your Mintz relationship attorney if you have any questions regarding the changes to the clean energy tax credits under the OBBBA and relevant guidance.

""With this proposal, EPA acknowledges how important biofuels like ethanol are to the rural economy,"" she said in a statement.
""We commend the Trump EPA for being the first-ever EPA to propose a way to ensure past-year SRE gallons don't compromise renewable fuel demand.","LINCOLN, Neb. (DTN) -- The Trump administration is planning to reallocate biofuels gallons lost through small-refinery exemptions to the Renewable Fuel Standard, according to a proposal released by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on Tuesday.

The question is, will it be 50%, 100%, another percentage, or even none of the gallons lost through exemptions from 2023 to 2025?

The EPA announced in August it had granted full exemptions on 63 petitions, partial exemptions on 77 petitions and denied 28 petitions on SRE requests covering 2016 to 2024.

EPA is proposing two approaches to reallocate volumes lost. One proposal accounts for 100% of the 2023-25 exempted renewable volume obligations -- or 2.18 billion gallons total. The other approach is to account for 50% of the 2023-25 exempted gallons -- or 1.09 billion gallons total.

The agency said it also is taking comments on other possible percentages, including reallocating no gallons, 25% or even 75%.

In addition, EPA is proposing to add a new SRE reallocation volume term in the percentage standard equations for 2026 and 2027, to account for small-refinery exemptions granted for the 2023-25 compliance years.

The agency said the proposed reallocation volumes and updated exempted projections would lead to revised proposed percentage standards for 2026 and 2027 that are lower than the original proposed standards in the current RFS volumes proposal yet to be completed.

PUBLIC HEARING, COMMENT PERIOD TO FOLLOW

Once the proposal is published in the Federal Register, the EPA said it will hold a public hearing followed by a 30-day public comment period.

EPA said it also expects ""additional exemptions"" to be granted for the 2025 compliance year.

""The ability for obligated parties to use these RINs to comply with the 2026 and 2027 RVOs is expected to impact demand for renewable fuel if not carefully considered,"" the agency said in a news release.

""This proposal is an important step in the EPA's tireless work to repair the damage done after four years of the Biden-Harris administration neglecting key components of the RFS program, including threats to transform the RFS program into a subsidy for electric vehicle charging stations as part of a larger strategy to electrify the transportation sector. The Trump administration reaffirms its renewed commitment to honor the program's purpose to support biofuels as an essential part of a thriving liquid fuels market.""

The EPA said it ""recognizes the importance"" of issuing one final Set 2 rule that establishes the RVOs for 2026 and 2027 and addresses the reallocation of SREs from 2023-2025.

RFA ENCOURAGED BY PROPOSAL

The Renewable Fuels Association said in a statement Tuesday that it was ""encouraged"" by EPA's proposal.

""While we continue to question whether any SREs for 2023-2025 are truly justified in the first place, we are encouraged that EPA is proposing to add the exempted volumes back to future RFS requirements for 2026 and 2027,"" said Geoff Cooper, RFA president and CEO.

""We support EPA's proposed option to fully reallocate 2023-2025 SREs and believe such an approach will ensure intended levels of renewable fuel consumption are maintained over the long-term. We appreciate that EPA continues to focus on SRE approaches that minimize marketplace disruptions, while honoring the congressional purpose and intent of the RFS program. EPA clearly recognizes that an unmitigated influx of RIN credits from SREs could devastate markets and undermine renewable fuel production and consumption.""

GROWTH ENERGY COMMENDS EPA

Growth Energy CEO Emily Skor said her group also supports the full reallocation option presented by EPA.

""With this proposal, EPA acknowledges how important biofuels like ethanol are to the rural economy,"" she said in a statement.

""We commend the Trump EPA for being the first-ever EPA to propose a way to ensure past-year SRE gallons don't compromise renewable fuel demand. Full reallocation of exempt gallons is a surefire way to drive income to America's rural communities.""

(AP) — It seems like a terrible time to build an electric vehicle plant in the United States, but Rivian Automotive leaders say they’re confident as the company starts long-delayed work on a $5 billion facility in Georgia.

The money-losing California-based company broke ground Tuesday east of Atlanta despite President Donald Trump’s successful push to roll back electric vehicle tax credits. Starting Sept. 30, buyers will no longer qualify for savings of up to $7,500 per car.

CEO RJ Scaringe said Tuesday that Rivian will sell its R2 sport utility vehicles not for environmental or tax incentive reasons, but because it’s a superior vehicle.

“The description I’ll say for R2 is it isn’t an electric vehicle,” he said. “I describe R2 as an incredible five-passenger offroad machine. And it happens to be electric.”

Georgia plant is key to a mass market and profitability

The Georgia plant, first announced in 2021, is Rivian’s key to reaching profitability. Now the company makes the high-end R1T pickup truck and the R1S SUV in Normal, Illinois, as well as delivery vans for Amazon and others. Its truck prices start at $71,000.

The Illinois plant will begin making the smaller R2 next year, with prices starting at $45,000. An expanded Illinois plant will be able to assemble 215,000 vehicles yearly. But if the R2 is a hit, and if Rivian successfully produces an even smaller R3, it will need more capacity. Scaringe said the Georgia operation, able to make 200,000 vehicles yearly starting in 2028, is the “foundation for our growth.” Rivian plans another 200,000 in capacity in phase two, volume that would spread fixed costs over many more vehicles.

The projections would be a big leap from the 40,000 to 46,000 vehicles Rivian expects to deliver this year, down from 52,000 last year. The company says it’s limiting production in part to launch 2026 models.

“For Rivian, it’s do-or-die time,” said Alex Oyler, North American director of auto research firm SBD Automotive. “We saw with Tesla that the key to profitability is scale, and you can’t scale if your cheapest vehicle is $70,000. So they need that plant online to achieve a level of scale of R2 and ultimately R3.”

Challenges in the electric vehicle market

Sales growth is slowing for electric vehicles in the United States, rising only 1.5% in 2025’s first half, according to Cox Automotive.

Tesla accounted for almost 45% of U.S. electric vehicle sales in that period, according to Cox. But the giant is losing market share as others gain: General Motors’ slice of American EV sales has climbed to 13%. By comparison, Rivian had a 3% share in the first half of the year, behind Tesla and six traditional automakers.

But excluding Tesla, Rivian is the most successful startup automaker.

The company initially tapped a largely unfilled niche: demand for electric pickups and SUVs. But competition now includes Ford’s F-150 Lightning and the electric Chevrolet Silverado.

After an initial public offering in 2021, Rivian shares have fallen by more than 80%, while automaker shares overall have outpaced the broader stock market. Rivian lost $1.66 billion in 2025’s first half.

At the same time, some automakers’ ardor for electric vehicles is cooling. Stellantis last week canceled Ram’s electric truck program. Ford has delayed production at a new Tennessee plant. And General Motors abandoned plans to build electric vehicles in suburban Detroit.

“With all the competition out there in this market and the slowing growth of EVs, it does not play in Rivian’s favor,” said Sam Fiorani, a vice president at AutoForecast Solutions. “However, there still is an EV market out there.”

$1.5 billion in incentives for 7,500 jobs

Georgia has pledged $1.5 billion of incentives to Rivian in exchange for 7,500 company jobs paying at least $56,000 a year on average. Rivian can’t benefit from most incentives unless it meets employment goals, but the state is already spending $175 million to buy and grade land and improve roads.

Georgia Republican Gov. Brian Kemp, says he wants to make Georgia “the electric mobility capital of America,” but acknowledged Tuesday that “the road to get here has not been smooth.” He voiced confidence that Rivian can deliver “an innovation revolution” benefitting Georgians.

While Tesla has thousands of employees in California and Texas, some new electric vehicle plants have sputtered. Two separate EV makers that hoped to assemble vehicles in a former GM plant in Lordstown, Ohio, went bankrupt. Georgia’s Hyundai complex near Savannah is faring better, with production underway. However, a battery plant there has been delayed by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement arresting 475 people on site, including more than 300 South Koreans.

Rivian was supposed to be making trucks by now at the 2,000-acre (800-hectare) site near Social Circle, about 45 miles (70 kilometers) east of Atlanta. As the company burned through cash in 2024, it paused construction. But German automaker Volkswagen agreed to invest $5.8 billion in Rivian in exchange for software and electrical technology. And then-President Joe Biden’s administration agreed to loan Rivian $6.6 billion to build the Georgia plant.

Despite the Trump administration’s hostility toward EVs, Scaringe said Tuesday that Rivian has built “a very close relationship” with the U.S. Department of Energy and that the company’s goals align with some of Trump’s big ones, including “U.S. manufacturing, U.S. technology, U.S. technology that supports global business, and leading in all those areas.”

Kemp said he has urged Energy Secretary Chris Wright to back Rivian.

Some neighbors still oppose the plant

Rivian also faces opposition from some residents who say the plant is an inappropriate neighbor to farms and will pollute the groundwater.

“I planned on dying and retiring on the front porch and the biggest project in Georgia has to go next door to me, of all places in the country?” asked Eddie Clay, who lives less than a mile away. He says his well water turned mud-choked after excavation at the Rivian site.

There are other challenges for Rivian, including tariffs costing $2,000 per vehicle, the Trump administration ending a tax-credit program that will cost the company $140 million in revenue this year, and long-term threats from low-priced, cutting-edge Chinese EVs. But Scaringe said the start of construction shows Rivian is working through its challenges.

“These are not the kinds of things you start without having clear sight to be able to fully finish and launch,” he said.

Known as the Clean Vehicle Credit , the benefit provides a tax discount of up to $7,500 for a new electric car, and up to $4,000 for a used one. It expires on Sept. 30.

The tax credit was approved as part of the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022 and initially set to last through 2032. That timeline was cut short, however, by Congress’ recent tax and spending-cut law, known as the “one big, beautiful bill,” which is also winding down several other tax incentives for clean-energy home upgrades.

The electric vehicle credits are income-based. For a new car, the benefit applies to people whose adjusted gross income is no more than $150,000 or $225,000 for heads-of-household. For joint tax filers, they must make no more than $300,000 to use the credit.

For used vehicles, the income thresholds are $75,000 for individuals, $122,500 for heads-of-household, and $150,000 for joint filers.

The vehicles must also meet certain requirements. For new cars, that includes having a battery capacity of at least seven kilowatt hours and having undergone final assembly in North America. For used vehicles, the car’s sale price cannot exceed $25,000, not including taxes or title and registration fees, along with other requirements.

While the federal incentive ends on Sept. 30, Colorado will continue offering a state-level tax credit for electric vehicles, though the benefit will be considerably smaller next year.

The survey of 1,000 likely 2026 voters commissioned by Conservatives for Clean Energy Florida shows that 78% support clean energy initiatives, including 63% of Republicans.

Two-thirds of voters overall in the poll (67%) would be more likely to vote for a candidate who supports growth of solar power in Florida. The survey also shows a shift toward support for nuclear power. When described “as something that Trump and large corporations support,” 62% of voters support increasing nuclear energy production.

“Pocketbook issues are clearly the number one issue of concern going into the 2026 election cycle, and connecting the dots here it’s very easy to see that Florida voters across the political spectrum understand that diversifying our portfolio and taking an ‘all of the above approach’ is going to be key to actually bringing their costs down,” said Zachary Colletti, executive director of Conservatives for Clean Energy. “That’s the most important story here.”

Solar power provides only 8% of the state’s electricity portfolio now, but that’s expected to increase over the next decade. The amount of solar power that will fuel the state will rise to 28% by 2032, according to a report published earlier this year by the Florida Public Service Commission.

The solar industry in Florida and across the country suffered a huge blow this summer following passage of President Donald Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” which removes a 30% tax break for individuals who buy rooftop solar panels, effective at the end of this year.

“Solar power has been getting a bad rap as of late, mostly because the public does not want to see green space turned into solar farms — which is totally understandable,” said Jake Hoffman, president of the Tampa Bay Young Republicans, in an email message.

“However, solar farms are not the only solar solution. If we want to be serious about filling the immediate need for energy independence, our government should be accelerating all forms of energy and solar energy with battery storage in locations that make sense as a major part of that equation.”

The survey shows that nearly three quarters of Republicans and two-thirds of NPA voters support nuclear power, while Democrats are split on the issue. Nuclear power supplied about 11% of Florida’s energy portfolio in 2024, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA). Florida Power & Light operates the only two functioning nuclear power plants in the state — at St. Lucie and Turkey Point. A third nuclear plant at Crystal River was shut down in 2013 by Duke Energy

Politics

Byron Donalds, the Naples Republican U.S. House member running for governor, is a supporter of nuclear power. He co-sponsored a resolution in 2023 expressing Congress’ commitment to embracing nuclear power as a clean baseload energy source.

Paul Renner, the former Florida House Speaker who recently entered the Republican race for governor, supported energy legislation (HB 1645) in the 2024 legislative session that erased several instances of the words “climate change” from state statutes.

“We are looking at ways — including clean energy ways — to make sure that we are not ever subject to brownouts and blackouts that places like California have suffered and other places are predicted to suffer that are not focusing on a reliable grid,” Renner told reporters in December 2023

“And, unfortunately, that works at cross-purposes with the uber-aggressive timeline that climate activists have put us on where they want us to go tomorrow. And if I had a magic wand and I could say, ‘All energy is clean energy and we will never use fossil fuels again and we can do that tomorrow at no cost,’ I would do it,” Renner continued. “Everybody should want a clean future. But that’s not realistic.”

The Florida Democratic Party’s leading candidate for governor, David Jolly, has said that if elected he would appoint people to the Public Service Commission “to begin to require our utilities to incorporate more clean and renewable energies.”

Nearly 12 million customers of Florida Power & Light Co. faced potentially the largest rate hike in U.S. history as recently as last month. However, days before the Public Service Commission was set to hear arguments in the case, FPL filed a four-year rate settlement agreement that reduced its original revenue request by approximately 30%, according to FPL.

Yet, the Michigan automotive industry could see increased investments from those same companies as they reallocate that funding.

While both Ford and GM previously announced ambitious targets to expand electric vehicle fleets over the next decade, they are now cutting back on electric vehicle production.

That comes in response to federal deregulation of gas-powered vehicles, tax credit cuts, and the prospect of slowing consumer demand.

In August, Ford stated it was canceling plans to build a new electric three-row SUV. Instead, it is turning its focus to hybrid vehicles, including a massive $5 billon investment into a new “affordable” hybrid truck.

GM announced similar plans earlier this month. It will be cutting back electric vehicle production at Kansas and Tennessee plants, anticipating a decline in demand once federal tax credits end Sept. 30.

This all could have a real impact on the electric vehicle industry across the nation and experts are already anticipating that.

A new forecast by Ernst & Young Global Limited now predicts a five-year delay in electric vehicles making up 50% of the new car marketshare. While previous forecasts predicted America would reach that mark by 2034, the new forecast pushed that back to 2039.

""The U.S. faces policy uncertainty, high costs, and infrastructure gaps,"" said Constantin M. Gall, the company's global aerospace defense and mobility leader.

Clean energy advocacy groups are decrying this move away from electric vehicle initiatives, largely blaming the Trump administration.

“The transition to electric vehicles now faces significant roadblocks,” said Ecology Center in an April report. “The Trump administration has rolled back key policies supporting clean transportation.”

It also pointed to a nationwide deregulation of the gas-powered vehicle industry for allowing those to remain “dominant” over electric vehicles.

“These actions prioritize fossil fuels over clean energy, threatening progress toward a sustainable transportation future,” the report stated.

While bad news for electric vehicle supporters, the Michigan automotive industry could be a winner as companies re-shift focus back to gas-powered and hybrid vehicles.

With billions of dollars previously allocated to federal pollution fines and electric vehicle costs now available for investment, GM now plans to increase production at a Detroit-area plant by 2027.

The Michigan-based company also recently announced plans to invest billions into another Michigan plant in Lake Orion Township.

For similar reasons, Ford’s CEO Jim Farley told analysts that the company anticipates monetary savings “has the potential to unlock a multibillion-dollar opportunity over the next two years.”

Subject of Research: Electrification of homes and vehicles in the U.S.","A future where homes and vehicles are fully electrified poses significant challenges to the power supply infrastructure in the United States, potentially leading to power outages. Researchers from Purdue University have recently conducted a comprehensive study to better understand this impending transformation and its implications. They noted that without critical upgrades to the distribution grid, the increased load from electric heating systems and vehicles could strain the existing framework and result in massive infrastructure costs. These necessary upgrades are estimated to be between $350 billion and $790 billion, which translates to individual household expenses ranging from $2,000 to $6,400 by 2050.

The research indicates that the electrification process would involve replacing existing home heating systems, like traditional boilers, with electric heat pumps and transitioning away from gasoline and diesel vehicles toward electric counterparts. This shift, while essential for meeting climate goals and enhancing energy efficiencies, necessitates a substantial increase in electricity demand. Kevin Kircher, a mechanical engineering assistant professor at Purdue University and a key contributor to the research, elucidates that such a transition will invariably require infrastructure enhancements, including thicker wiring and more potent transformers.

Moreover, the coldest regions in the United States could see electricity demand spikes reaching five times above current peak levels, which would exacerbate the challenges utilities face in maintaining reliability. The financial burden imposed on consumers is a significant concern, as utilities tend to pass on infrastructure costs directly to customers. The implications of these costs could push the electrification benefits significantly out of reach for the average household if expansive measures are not implemented.

However, the study reveals a silver lining: strategic mitigations can significantly reduce grid reinforcement expenses by two-thirds. By adopting methods such as improving home insulation and prioritizing energy efficiency, potential financial burdens can be minimized. For instance, using ground-source heat pumps rather than air-source heat pumps can lead to greater efficiencies. Ground-source systems benefit from consistent ground temperatures, which reduce energy consumption for heating and cooling, demonstrating that not all electric systems are created equal when it comes to efficiency.

An impactful recommendation from the research emphasizes the importance of coordinating the operation of electric devices in homes. By optimizing the timing for charging electric vehicles and utilizing electric heating systems, demand on the electrical grid can be balanced to minimize strain during peak usage periods. This can lead to sub-optimal charging times for electric vehicles if not managed correctly, but with smart technology, homes could leverage their entire electric ecosystem to work in harmony.

Priyadarshan, a PhD candidate and primary author of the study, underscores the potential of integrating communication between electric vehicles and HVAC systems. The research highlights a transformative concept where electric vehicles could adjust their charging schedules to avoid simultaneous operation with heating systems, thereby alleviating grid demands during critical times. This form of coordination could realize a 40% reduction in grid reinforcement costs, demonstrating the paramount importance of smart technology in the electrification landscape.

Furthermore, this extensive study analyzed each of the Lower 48 U.S. states, modeling the effects of complete electrification on distribution grids while integrating specific data. This comprehensive approach included public surveys assessing home electricity usage, electric vehicle travel patterns, equipment specifications, building code guidelines, and localized weather data. To ensure the accuracy of their findings, researchers calibrated their model against a fully electrified test house, the DC Nanogrid House in West Lafayette, Indiana.

The model’s sophistication allowed researchers to explore various strategies for enhancing the efficiency of residential energy use and quantifying how those measures affect grid demands. By adjusting these parameters with their proposed strategies for home weatherization and equipment efficiency, the researchers aimed to devise a holistic approach for tackling future electrification challenges.

While various studies have probed into the electrification of homes and vehicles before, this research stands out due to its nationwide, county-by-county analysis. It offers unparalleled insights into local grid demands and the economic ramifications of transitioning to an electrified future. The correlation between household electrification and grid reliability is an intricate web that demands meticulous exploration, and this study begins to unravel that complexity.

The conclusions drawn from this research cast a dual perspective on the electrification phenomenon. On one hand, there is a palpable sense of urgency and concern surrounding the substantial expenses that an uncoordinated electrification effort could engender. Conversely, if electrification is approached intelligently and systematically, many of these financial challenges can be mitigated, leading to a more sustainable and efficient future.

Individuals and families across the nation can rest assured that ongoing research is seeking to illuminate the pathways of transitioning to an electrified society, emphasizing the need for innovative and cooperative solutions to make electrification both feasible and economically viable. As the country steps toward this new horizon, the emphasis will lie in fostering responsible and smart use of energy resources, ensuring that everyone benefits from the advancements in electrification without overwhelming the existing power infrastructure.

Ultimately, this research serves as a stepping stone for policymakers, utilities, and consumers to collaborate actively in crafting solutions that not only accommodate but also thrive amidst the electrification wave. Awareness of the implications, coupled with strategic implementations, will be imperative as the march toward a fully electrified society continues to unfold.

The survey of 1,000 likely 2026 voters commissioned by Conservatives for Clean Energy Florida shows that 78% support clean energy initiatives, including 63% of Republicans.

Two-thirds of voters overall in the poll (67%) would be more likely to vote for a candidate who supports growth of solar power in Florida. The survey also shows a shift toward support for nuclear power. When described “as something that Trump and large corporations support,” 62% of voters support increasing nuclear energy production.

“Pocketbook issues are clearly the number one issue of concern going into the 2026 election cycle, and connecting the dots here it’s very easy to see that Florida voters across the political spectrum understand that diversifying our portfolio and taking an ‘all of the above approach’ is going to be key to actually bringing their costs down,” said Zachary Colletti, executive director of Conservatives for Clean Energy. “That’s the most important story here.”

Solar power provides only 8% of the state’s electricity portfolio now, but that’s expected to increase over the next decade. The amount of solar power that will fuel the state will rise to 28% by 2032, according to a report published earlier this year by the Florida Public Service Commission.

The solar industry in Florida and across the country suffered a huge blow this summer following passage of President Donald Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” which removes a 30% tax break for individuals who buy rooftop solar panels, effective at the end of this year.

“Solar power has been getting a bad rap as of late, mostly because the public does not want to see green space turned into solar farms — which is totally understandable,” said Jake Hoffman, president of the Tampa Bay Young Republicans, in an email message.

“However, solar farms are not the only solar solution. If we want to be serious about filling the immediate need for energy independence, our government should be accelerating all forms of energy and solar energy with battery storage in locations that make sense as a major part of that equation.”

The survey shows that nearly three quarters of Republicans and two-thirds of NPA voters support nuclear power, while Democrats are split on the issue. Nuclear power supplied about 11% of Florida’s energy portfolio in 2024, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA). Florida Power & Light operates the only two functioning nuclear power plants in the state — at St. Lucie and Turkey Point. A third nuclear plant at Crystal River was shut down in 2013 by Duke Energy

Politics

Byron Donalds, the Naples Republican U.S. House member running for governor, is a supporter of nuclear power. He co-sponsored a resolution in 2023 expressing Congress’ commitment to embracing nuclear power as a clean baseload energy source.

Paul Renner, the former Florida House Speaker who recently entered the Republican race for governor, supported energy legislation (HB 1645) in the 2024 legislative session that erased several instances of the words “climate change” from state statutes.

“We are looking at ways — including clean energy ways — to make sure that we are not ever subject to brownouts and blackouts that places like California have suffered and other places are predicted to suffer that are not focusing on a reliable grid,” Renner told reporters in December 2023

“And, unfortunately, that works at cross-purposes with the uber-aggressive timeline that climate activists have put us on where they want us to go tomorrow. And if I had a magic wand and I could say, ‘All energy is clean energy and we will never use fossil fuels again and we can do that tomorrow at no cost,’ I would do it,” Renner continued. “Everybody should want a clean future. But that’s not realistic.”

The Florida Democratic Party’s leading candidate for governor, David Jolly, has said that if elected he would appoint people to the Public Service Commission “to begin to require our utilities to incorporate more clean and renewable energies.”

Nearly 12 million customers of Florida Power & Light Co. faced potentially the largest rate hike in U.S. history as recently as last month. However, days before the Public Service Commission was set to hear arguments in the case, FPL filed a four-year rate settlement agreement that reduced its original revenue request by approximately 30%, according to FPL.

Dive Brief:

CenterPoint Energy took a step toward its first networked geothermal pilot in Minnesota this month by selecting Resource Innovations and Salas O’Brien to support site selection and a feasibility study, the Texas-based electric and natural gas utility said.

CenterPoint has been gauging local governments’ interest in collaborating on the pilot since its launch late last year. The company said it expects to conduct siting and modeling work to identify a preferred site over the coming months.

The networked geothermal pilot is one of 17 pilot projects and seven research and development efforts CenterPoint is pursuing as part of its first five-year innovation plan submitted under Minnesota’s Natural Gas Innovation Act, the utility said. Other initiatives involve renewable natural gas, green hydrogen and hybrid gas and electric heating systems.

Dive Insight:

A networked geothermal system is a type of thermal energy network that can heat and cool multiple buildings in a campus, neighborhood or mixed-use district. Using the relatively constant temperature of the earth as a heat source and sink, they transfer heat through underground water pipes and a network of heat pumps, CenterPoint said.

When powered by renewable or low-carbon electricity, networked geothermal systems can effectively decarbonize building climate control.

Municipalities and institutions have used thermal energy networks — also known as district energy systems — for decades in North America, Europe and other parts of the world. But U.S. utilities have been relatively slow to adopt the technology. Eversource Energy commissioned the United States’ first utility-owned networked geothermal system last year in Framingham, Massachusetts.

Massachusetts is one of at least eight states, including Minnesota, that Climate Xchange says have enacted policies supporting thermal energy network development. California, Colorado, Maryland, New York, Vermont and Washington and have similar policies, Climate Xchange says.

Minnesota enacted the Natural Gas Innovation Act in 2021. The law “creates a new regulatory framework for natural gas utilities to invest in renewable energy resources and innovative technologies,” according to CenterPoint.

“This pilot project is an opportunity, as we see it, to learn a lot about these types of systems,” said Emma Ingebretsen, CenterPoint manager of NGIA and decarbonization projects.

Ingebretsen said CenterPoint “is continuing to engage with communities and did get some interest” in the pilot but did not name any potential customers. The innovation plan the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission approved last year envisions the pilot system operating by the end of the plan’s five-year term, she added.

Ingebretsen said the siting and feasibility study process will first “take a high-level look … for ideal sites” in communities that have expressed interest in the pilot, then do more in-depth costing and impact analyses on a smaller group of possibilities. Promising locations would likely feature a mix of residential, commercial and public buildings with balanced energy loads, possibly oriented around an “anchor customer” with significant energy needs, she said.

“Having a strong anchor customer at a site is going to be one of the key pieces we look at to get down into the [narrower] set of sites” that come in for detailed analysis, Ingebretsen said.

CenterPoint also offers incentives, including rebates, to partially offset research, installation and operational costs for commercial and industrial customers considering networked geothermal systems. As with the pilot project, the “ideal customer location would include multiple buildings in one area, such as on a campus or complex,” Ingebretsen said.

Ingebretsen suggested those incentives could help CenterPoint retain larger customers with ambitious decarbonization goals. The city of Minneapolis, for example, aims to be carbon-neutral by 2050 and to source all of its electricity from renewables by 2030. Minneapolis is located in Hennepin County, which hopes to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 45% in 2030 and reach net zero by 2050.

CenterPoint is “seeking opportunities to work with current customers to decarbonize their existing district energy systems,” again offering rebates to offset the cost of studying and implementing “strategic electrification, energy efficiency, low-carbon fuels or other greenhouse gas reduction technologies,” Ingebretesen said.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/TFL6g_1EB3_jz-Ql96nlC4fEFbqwZzs1uVdnqvky6mY/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0yMjMzNzAwMzI1LmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-09-16 19:00:40.461828

Several energy experts spoke with EnergySage are a safer, more reliable option for the power grid than renewable options such as solar and wind.

The experts vehemently disagreed. They said solar energy should be a backbone of any future energy initiative and debunked the anti-solar talking points used in the report.

Solar energy provides homes and communities with clean, low-cost energy offers free tools that allow homeowners to quickly compare quotes from local, verified installers.

The key, these experts say, is pairing solar panels with battery storage, a combination that rebuffs most of the claims that critics make about solar energy.

Take, for example, the critique that solar can't work around the clock because the sun isn't always visible. Batteries store the excess energy created when the sun is out, and reports show that sunny locations can achieve 97% energy reliability just with solar and storage.

And if the grid does experience problems, batteries react more quickly than other sources, meaning your power stays on.

""This speed advantage is especially critical as the aging grid struggles to keep up with rising electricity demand, increasing the risk of blackouts,"" EnergySage wrote.

For proof, the company pointed to California, which has increased its use of renewable energy and battery storage to great success. In 2024, the state's largest utility service area ran fully on clean energy for 60% of days without experiencing any outages or asking customers to reduce their usage.

Even better is that stability comes with lower costs. People who use at-home solar, buyers can save significant money on their purchase and installation costs — with the average homeowner keeping $10,000.

Residents of each state can see just how much incentives will save them and the average cost of solar panels by using EnergySage's free mapping tool to find the right systems and installers for their budgets.

While many of the tax credits for solar panels and home appliance upgrades are expiring at the end of 2025, you can still act to save yourself thousands of dollars. A solar installation must be completed by the end of the year to claim the 30% tax credit.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/xyZ9fvxvxkYKt1EHli883Q--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_cool_down_737/b1266e4e6d40d9d3ca8d5d7731b1caaa,N,,2025-09-16 19:00:32.343485

Soon after, California enacted the California Environmental Quality Act, which required reviews of new development to address potential environmental impacts.
Mr. Newsom, in a State of the State letter he sent to lawmakers last week, still made that case.
Mary Creasman, the chief executive of California Environmental Voters, repeatedly used an expletive to describe how things had gone at the State Capitol this year.
Republican state lawmakers said they felt some sense of redemption from the Democrats’ approach in California this year.","California has long prided itself as an environmental trailblazer. It was the first state to set its own vehicle emission rules and the first to outlaw plastic shopping bags.

In 2020, Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, went so far as to seek a ban on the sale of new gas-powered vehicles by 2035. Standing in front of several electric cars, he warned automakers against being on “the wrong side of history.”

So it surprised environmentalists this year when Mr. Newsom and Democratic lawmakers began backtracking on signature green initiatives. They rebuked the state’s coastal preservation commission for regulatory overreach and rolled back the landmark California Environmental Quality Act, better known as CEQA, to address the state’s severe housing shortage.

“It’s a complete 180,” said Hollin Kretzmann, a lawyer at the Climate Law Institute, part of the nonprofit Center for Biological Diversity that focuses on protecting endangered species. “It’s become more urgent than ever to rid ourselves of fossil fuels, so it’s really inexplicable why our policymakers in Sacramento are moving the exact opposite way we should be going.”

Even in liberal California, Democrats say they have been stung by their party’s tailspin after last year’s losses in national elections. They understand that voters are frustrated with the high cost of living in California, and they are trying to show that they are doing something about it.

If they gain traction by tilting toward pocketbook issues, even at the expense of long-held environmental orthodoxy, it could provide lessons to Democrats nationally even if it angers activists locally.

Gas prices have long been higher in California than elsewhere — they’re about 45 percent higher than the national average at the moment — but lawmakers are worried that costs could skyrocket if they don’t help the oil industry immediately. And the transition to electric vehicles has not advanced to a point where drivers — or politicians — can ignore prices at the pump.

“Climate leadership is not $10-a-gallon gas — we need California to be an inspiration and not a cautionary tale,” said Assemblywoman Cottie Petrie-Norris, a Democrat from Orange County who chairs the energy committee in the State Assembly. “For decades, there were policymakers and advocates who somehow thought we could set really high goals and wave a magic wand and deliver on them.”

“We are all out of magic wands,” she said.

The modern environmental movement was born in California when an oil spill in 1969 off the coast of Santa Barbara captured the attention of Americans who were increasingly concerned about how development was harming the natural world around them. The disaster led to the first Earth Day in 1970, when coast-to-coast demonstrations drew a stunning 20 million Americans — one-tenth of the country’s population at the time — and precipitated action at the state and federal levels to safeguard the environment.

Soon after, California enacted the California Environmental Quality Act, which required reviews of new development to address potential environmental impacts. In 1972, voters approved the creation of the California Coastal Commission, a state agency in charge of protecting the seashore and ensuring public beach access. In the years since, California has approved a number of standards for water and air quality, and the state instituted the nation’s first cap-and-trade-programs.

Democrats have long asserted that they can help American consumers and improve the environment all at once. They have promoted the idea that workers in fossil fuel industries can transition to jobs in clean energy. That drivers will ultimately save money by charging their vehicles instead of pumping gas. That homes will become more efficient and need less energy for heating and cooling.

Mr. Newsom, in a State of the State letter he sent to lawmakers last week, still made that case. “In California,” he wrote, “economic growth and environmental protection go hand in hand.”

But for many Democratic state legislators, Mr. Trump’s presidential victory last year was something of a reckoning. After that loss — in which Republicans made gains in California — lawmakers said they had begun to consider whether their priorities were truly in line with voters’ daily concerns, like paying for rent or groceries.

At the end of the legislative session on Saturday, state lawmakers passed a proposal to allow more oil drilling in Kern County, a petroleum-rich region in the Central Valley. The legislation could allow up to 2,000 new oil and gas wells to be drilled in the county per year for 10 years.

Mr. Newsom had previously pledged to end oil drilling in the state by 2045. But after two refineries announced closures, he now says that he must be realistic about ensuring there’s enough fuel to supply California’s needs.

“We are all the beneficiaries of oil and gas. No one is naive about that,” Mr. Newsom said at a recent news conference, noting that he personally flies around the state. “It’s always been about finding a just transition, a pragmatism.”

To environmentalists, however, pragmatism sounds a lot like selling out. Mary Creasman, the chief executive of California Environmental Voters, repeatedly used an expletive to describe how things had gone at the State Capitol this year. More than a dozen pro-environment bills, such as efforts to keep PFAS chemicals out of drinking water and to create a 3,000-acre conservancy near Fresno, stalled in the Legislature this year, she said.

Environmentalists also believed that the catastrophic Los Angeles fires in January, the most expensive climate disaster in United States history, should have been a catalyst to pass climate change bills, not roll back regulations.

“I fear that the things that Newsom is doing and the legislators are doing are rolling us back,” said Kathryn Phillips, a former director of Sierra Club California who worked on many of the state environmental initiatives in place today. “They aren’t pressing to move harder and faster on shifting us out of a dependence on fossil fuels for vehicles and so on, and instead are clearing the way for some things to go back to the way they were.”

Polls show that voters still see environmental issues as a priority. But as their personal budgets are stretched ever more thin, Californians want help reducing the costs of housing, gas and electricity.

The oil legislation was part of a larger package of bills that lawmakers sent to Mr. Newsom last week. One proposal would extend the state’s cap-and-trade program, which sets limits on emissions and requires companies to buy credits if they exceed them. Another bill would allow California to participate in a regional energy grid, which could increase reliability but also increase the share of electricity produced by fossil fuels.

The tonal shift among Democrats seems partly to reflect a growing acceptance that the state’s transition to clean energy hasn’t come as fast as they had once hoped. A vast majority of drivers still rely on gas-powered vehicles and live in sprawling metropolitan areas where they do not regularly take mass transit.

Meanwhile, Republicans in Washington have made it even harder for Americans to adopt clean technologies. President Trump and House Republicans this year blocked the state from carrying out Mr. Newsom’s prohibition on the sale of new gas-powered vehicles in 2035. They also revoked the state’s authority to set its own tailpipe emissions standards. And incentives for purchasing electric vehicles will end this month as a result of Republican legislation.

Republican state lawmakers said they felt some sense of redemption from the Democrats’ approach in California this year. “I have long warned about the dangers of eliminating reliable energy in favor of costly green agendas,” said Shannon Grove, a Republican state senator from Bakersfield whose district includes many of the oil wells that would benefit from the package on the governor’s desk.

Henry Stern, a Democratic state senator from the Los Angeles area who has long been considered an environmental leader, said that the green movement may need to become more pragmatic to ensure its longevity. He marveled at the fact that he was once wrote anti-fracking laws and was now working on legislation to allow more drilling in Kern County.

He believes California has a responsibility to show the nation that climate policies can be smart and cost-saving, in a moment when the Trump administration has attacked clean energy initiatives.

“In California, we can sort of project this perfectionism,” Mr. Stern said. “But we drive more than anyone. So, yeah, we’re complicit, too. We’re a leader in electric vehicles and petroleum consumption, we’re both.”

He recognized that many voters don’t want to be told “that driving a pickup and eating a hamburger is evil.” But he said that many of them would support environmental policies that also resulted in cost savings.

“This whole environmental movement — has it failed? ” he asked. “Or is it evolving into something that can actually be more durable, regardless of politics? The optimist in me likes to think we can actually do more in this moment.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/09/11/multimedia/11nat-ca-environment-zwtl/11nat-ca-environment-zwtl-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-09-16 16:01:24.539525

The plan is moving forward after the Trump administration lifted a funding freeze that sparked a lawsuit from impacted states.

The project will add up to 74 fast-charging stations, mostly in rural areas, to reduce ""range anxiety.""

Transportation officials in Arizona will move forward with a plan to create a statewide electric vehicle charging network after President Donald Trump's administration reopened a federal program funding the project and issued new guidance on the location of the charging stations.

The Arizona Department of Transportation recently said it planned to build or upgrade nearly two dozen electric vehicle charging stations across the state in the final phase of the effort.

The project, funded with $76.5 million from the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Program, is intended to encourage electric vehicle adoption and reduce so-called ""range anxiety.""

It will help construct a total of up to 74 charging stations along major highways — most in rural areas of the state. Those facilities will each house at least four fast-charging ports designed to juice up a standard electric vehicle in under 30 minutes.

Trump has repeatedly denounced the program, which was established by the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act in 2021, and federal officials paused its funding allocations earlier this year.

But they quickly found themselves embroiled in a lawsuit from a coalition of more than a dozen states. After a months-long funding freeze, a federal judge ultimately issued a preliminary injunction in the states' favor.

Now, the program is back — with some new federal guidance. That update removed requirements that charging stations be located no more than 50 miles apart, and within a mile of the highway. Garin Groff, a spokesperson for ADOT, said that wouldn't affect previously approved plans and would give officials ""better flexibility"" when locating stations around grid capacity, geography and other factors.

Are chargers keeping up with the electric vehicle boom?

About 90,000 electric vehicles were registered in Arizona as of 2023, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. That's the most recent year for which registration data is available.

Another 26,000 cars registered in the state were considered plug-in hybrids, meaning they have both a traditional gasoline engine and an electric motor that can be externally charged.

Both electric vehicles and hybrids are becoming increasingly popular in the state — the data shows registrations of both types of cars have roughly tripled since 2020.

But there's only about 4,400 charging ports currently available statewide. Most are concentrated in the Phoenix and Tucson metros, and only about 1,200 are considered fast-charging ports. That's about one public port for every 20 electric vehicles — a ratio that doesn't account for plug-in hybrid cars.

Still, it's a slightly better ratio than in years past. In 2020, Arizona had about one public charging port for every 21 electric vehicles.

When will the new stations come online?

ADOT approved awards late last year for an initial set of 18 stations located along I-10, I-8, I-40, I-17 and I-19. Construction is expected to be completed in 2026.

The remaining stations will be completed in following years. Officials plan to begin evaluating construction proposals for the second set of charging stations this fall. That includes up to 35 stations along I-10, I-40, U.S. 60, U.S. 89, U.S. 93, U.S. 95, U.S. 160, State Route 64, State Route 68, State Route 80, State Route 87, State Route 90, State Route 95, State Route 260 and State Route 347.

The roadmap, titled “Multistate Action Plan: Accelerating the Transition to Zero-Emission Residential Buildings,” was developed by a coalition of states under a February 2024 agreement setting a shared goal for heat pumps to meet at least 65% of residential-scale heating, air conditioning and water heating sales by 2030 and 90% by 2040 across the participating states.

“Accelerating the transition of our aging and obsolete infrastructure will require collaboration across the public and private sectors,” said Nick Sracic, public sector, energy executive, at Johnson Controls, Inc. “As the number of administrators shrink in the public sector, contract models that de-risk the adoption of technology and leverage future savings will be essential. Traditional models like Energy Performance Contracting can be essential tools but emerging Energy and Infrastructure as-a-service offerings promise much potential.”

“Clean, energy-efficient buildings help households and businesses save money while supporting local jobs and economic growth,” said Andy Frank, president and founder of Sealed. “Sealed supports expanding incentive programs and workforce development to make these upgrades easier and more accessible, and we’re encouraged that states are working together to advance these solutions.”

Businesses support responsible policies that expand efficient technologies to cut costs, reduce energy waste, and improve indoor air quality—delivering benefits for the electric grid, the economy, and public health nationwide. Following the February 2024 announcement of states shared commitment to accelerate clean technologies like heat pumps in new and existing homes, more than 20 companies sent a letter to governors endorsing collective state action to decarbonize the building sector and speed market adoption of energy-saving solutions.

(AP) — With the explosive growth of Big Tech’s data centers threatening to overload U.S. electricity grids, policymakers are taking a hard look at a tough-love solution: bumping the energy-hungry data centers off grids during power emergencies.

Texas moved first, as state lawmakers try to protect residents in the data-center hotspot from another deadly blackout, like the winter storm in 2021 when dozens died.

Now the concept is emerging in the 13-state mid-Atlantic grid and elsewhere as massive data centers are coming online faster than power plants can be built and connected to grids. That has elicited pushback from data centers and Big Tech, for whom a steady power supply is vital.

Like many other states, Texas wants to attract data centers as an economic boon, but it faces the challenge of meeting the huge volumes of electricity the centers demand. Lawmakers there passed a bill in June that, among other things, orders up standards for power emergencies when utilities must disconnect big electric users.

That, in theory, would save enough electricity to avoid a broad blackout on the handful of days during the year when it is hottest or coldest and power consumption pushes grids to their limits or beyond.

Texas was first, but it won’t be the last, analysts say, now that the late 2022 debut of OpenAI’s ChatGPT ignited worldwide demand for chatbots and other generative AI products that typically require large amounts of computing power to train and operate.

“We’re going to see that kind of thing pop up everywhere,” said Michael Webber, a University of Texas engineering professor who specializes in energy. “Data center flexibility will be expected, required, encouraged, mandated, whatever it is.”

Data centers are threatening grids

That’s because grids can’t keep up with the fast-growing number of data center projects unfolding in Texas and perhaps 20 other states as the U.S. competes in a race against China for artificial intelligence superiority.

Grid operators in Texas, the Great Plains states and the mid-Atlantic region have produced eye-popping projections showing that electricity demand in the coming years will spike, largely due to data centers.

A proposal similar to Texas’ has emerged from the nation’s biggest grid operator, PJM Interconnection, which runs the mid-Atlantic grid that serves 65 million people and data-center hotspots in Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania.

The CEO of the Southwest Power Pool, which operates the grid that serves 18 million people primarily in Kansas, Oklahoma and other Great Plains states, said it has no choice but to expand power-reduction programs — likely for the biggest power users — to meet growing demand.

The proposals are cropping up at a time when electricity bills nationally are rising fast — twice the rate of inflation, according to federal data — and growing evidence suggests that the bills of some regular Americans are rising to subsidize the gargantuan energy needs of Big Tech.

Analysts say power plant construction cannot keep up with the growth of data center demand, and that something must change.

“Data center load has the potential to overwhelm the grid, and I think it is on its way to doing that,” said Joe Bowring, who heads Monitoring Analytics, the independent market watchdog in the mid-Atlantic grid.

Data centers might have to adjust

Big Tech is trying to make their data centers more energy efficient. They are also installing backup generators, typically fueled by diesel, to ensure an uninterrupted power supply if there’s a power outage.

Data center operators, however, say they hadn’t anticipated needing that backup power supply to help grid operators meet demand and are closely watching how utility regulators in Texas write the regulations.

The Data Center Coalition, which represents Big Tech companies and data center developers, wants the standards to be flexible, since some data centers may not be able to switch to backup power as easily or as quickly as others.

The grid operator also should balance that system with financial rewards for data centers that voluntarily shut down during emergencies, said Dan Diorio of the Data Center Coalition.

Nation’s largest grid operator has a proposal

PJM’s just-released proposal revolves around a concept in which proposed data centers may not be guaranteed to receive electricity during a power emergency.

That’s caused a stir among power plant owners and the tech industry.

Many questioned PJM’s legal authority to enforce it or warned of destabilizing energy markets and states scaring off investors and developers with uncertainty and risk.

“This is particularly concerning given that states within PJM’s footprint actively compete with other U.S. regions for data center and digital infrastructure investment,” the Digital Power Network, a group of Bitcoin miners and data center developers, said in written comments to PJM.

The governors of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Illinois and Maryland said they worried that it’s too unpredictable to provide a permanent solution and that it should at least be accompanied by incentives for data centers to build new power sources and voluntarily reduce electricity use.

Others, including consumer advocates, warned that it won’t lower electric bills and that PJM should instead pursue a “bring your own generation” requirement for data centers to, in essence, build their own power source.

A deal is shrouded in secrecy

In Indiana, Google took a voluntary route.

Last month, the electric utility, Indiana & Michigan Power, and the tech giant filed a power-supply contract with Indiana regulators for a proposed $2 billion data center planned in Fort Wayne in which Google agreed to reduce electricity use there when the grid is stressed. The data center would, it said, reduce electricity use by delaying non-urgent tasks to when the electric grid is under less stress.

However, important details are being kept from the public and Ben Inskeep of the Citizens Action Coalition, a consumer advocacy group, said that leaves it unclear how valuable the arrangement really is, if at all.

A new way of thinking about electricity

To an extent, bumping big users off the grid during high-demand periods presents a new approach to electricity.

It could save money for regular ratepayers, since power is most expensive during peak usage periods.

Abe Silverman, an energy researcher at Johns Hopkins University, said that data centers can and do use all the electricity they want on most days.

But taking data centers off the grid for those handful of hours during the most extreme heat or cold would mean not having to spend billions of dollars to build a bunch of power plants, he said.

“And the question is, is that worth it? Is it worth it for society to build those 10 new power plants just to serve the data centers for five hours a year?” Silverman said. “Or is there a better way to do it?”",https://www.renewableenergyworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AP25254502230745-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-09-16 19:00:49.816933

(AP) — It seems like a terrible time to build an electric vehicle plant in the United States, but Rivian Automotive leaders say they’re confident as the company starts long-delayed work on a $5 billion facility in Georgia.

The money-losing California-based company broke ground Tuesday east of Atlanta despite President Donald Trump’s successful push to roll back electric vehicle tax credits. Starting Sept. 30, buyers will no longer qualify for savings of up to $7,500 per car.

CEO RJ Scaringe said Tuesday that Rivian will sell its R2 sport utility vehicles not for environmental or tax incentive reasons, but because it’s a superior vehicle.

“The description I’ll say for R2 is it isn’t an electric vehicle,” he said. “I describe R2 as an incredible five-passenger offroad machine. And it happens to be electric.”

Georgia plant is key to a mass market and profitability

The Georgia plant, first announced in 2021, is Rivian’s key to reaching profitability. Now the company makes the high-end R1T pickup truck and the R1S SUV in Normal, Illinois, as well as delivery vans for Amazon and others. Its truck prices start at $71,000.

The Illinois plant will begin making the smaller R2 next year, with prices starting at $45,000. An expanded Illinois plant will be able to assemble 215,000 vehicles yearly. But if the R2 is a hit, and if Rivian successfully produces an even smaller R3, it will need more capacity. Scaringe said the Georgia operation, able to make 200,000 vehicles yearly starting in 2028, is the “foundation for our growth.” Rivian plans another 200,000 in capacity in phase two, volume that would spread fixed costs over many more vehicles.

The projections would be a big leap from the 40,000 to 46,000 vehicles Rivian expects to deliver this year, down from 52,000 last year. The company says it’s limiting production in part to launch 2026 models.

“For Rivian, it’s do-or-die time,” said Alex Oyler, North American director of auto research firm SBD Automotive. “We saw with Tesla that the key to profitability is scale, and you can’t scale if your cheapest vehicle is $70,000. So they need that plant online to achieve a level of scale of R2 and ultimately R3.”

Challenges in the electric vehicle market

Sales growth is slowing for electric vehicles in the United States, rising only 1.5% in 2025’s first half, according to Cox Automotive.

Tesla accounted for almost 45% of U.S. electric vehicle sales in that period, according to Cox. But the giant is losing market share as others gain: General Motors’ slice of American EV sales has climbed to 13%. By comparison, Rivian had a 3% share in the first half of the year, behind Tesla and six traditional automakers.

But excluding Tesla, Rivian is the most successful startup automaker.

The company initially tapped a largely unfilled niche: demand for electric pickups and SUVs. But competition now includes Ford’s F-150 Lightning and the electric Chevrolet Silverado.

After an initial public offering in 2021, Rivian shares have fallen by more than 80%, while automaker shares overall have outpaced the broader stock market. Rivian lost $1.66 billion in 2025’s first half.

At the same time, some automakers’ ardor for electric vehicles is cooling. Stellantis last week canceled Ram’s electric truck program. Ford has delayed production at a new Tennessee plant. And General Motors abandoned plans to build electric vehicles in suburban Detroit.

“With all the competition out there in this market and the slowing growth of EVs, it does not play in Rivian’s favor,” said Sam Fiorani, a vice president at AutoForecast Solutions. “However, there still is an EV market out there.”

$1.5 billion in incentives for 7,500 jobs

Georgia has pledged $1.5 billion of incentives to Rivian in exchange for 7,500 company jobs paying at least $56,000 a year on average. Rivian can’t benefit from most incentives unless it meets employment goals, but the state is already spending $175 million to buy and grade land and improve roads.

Georgia Republican Gov. Brian Kemp, says he wants to make Georgia “the electric mobility capital of America,” but acknowledged Tuesday that “the road to get here has not been smooth.” He voiced confidence that Rivian can deliver “an innovation revolution” benefitting Georgians.

While Tesla has thousands of employees in California and Texas, some new electric vehicle plants have sputtered. Two separate EV makers that hoped to assemble vehicles in a former GM plant in Lordstown, Ohio, went bankrupt. Georgia’s Hyundai complex near Savannah is faring better, with production underway. However, a battery plant there has been delayed by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement arresting 475 people on site, including more than 300 South Koreans.

Rivian was supposed to be making trucks by now at the 2,000-acre (800-hectare) site near Social Circle, about 45 miles (70 kilometers) east of Atlanta. As the company burned through cash in 2024, it paused construction. But German automaker Volkswagen agreed to invest $5.8 billion in Rivian in exchange for software and electrical technology. And then-President Joe Biden’s administration agreed to loan Rivian $6.6 billion to build the Georgia plant.

Despite the Trump administration’s hostility toward EVs, Scaringe said Tuesday that Rivian has built “a very close relationship” with the U.S. Department of Energy and that the company’s goals align with some of Trump’s big ones, including “U.S. manufacturing, U.S. technology, U.S. technology that supports global business, and leading in all those areas.”

Kemp said he has urged Energy Secretary Chris Wright to back Rivian.

Some neighbors still oppose the plant

Rivian also faces opposition from some residents who say the plant is an inappropriate neighbor to farms and will pollute the groundwater.

“I planned on dying and retiring on the front porch and the biggest project in Georgia has to go next door to me, of all places in the country?” asked Eddie Clay, who lives less than a mile away. He says his well water turned mud-choked after excavation at the Rivian site.

There are other challenges for Rivian, including tariffs costing $2,000 per vehicle, the Trump administration ending a tax-credit program that will cost the company $140 million in revenue this year, and long-term threats from low-priced, cutting-edge Chinese EVs. But Scaringe said the start of construction shows Rivian is working through its challenges.

“These are not the kinds of things you start without having clear sight to be able to fully finish and launch,” he said.

By securing $1.5 billion in state incentives to build a $5 billion factory near Social Circle, Georgia,

is not only positioning itself for scalable production but also leveraging job creation and product diversification to accelerate EV market penetration. This analysis explores how these elements—state incentives, long-term employment, and a broader product portfolio—could redefine Rivian's trajectory in the EV sector.

State Incentives: A Catalyst for Scalable Production

Georgia's $1.5 billion incentive package for Rivian's Social Circle plant is among the most aggressive state-level commitments to EV manufacturing in recent years. The deal, which requires Rivian to deliver 80% of its promised jobs and investments by 2030, reflects Georgia's strategic bet on the EV industry as a driver of economic growthUpdate on new Georgia plant - site development resumed[ 1 ]. While the exact structure of the incentives—tax credits, infrastructure funding, or workforce development programs—remains unspecified, historical precedents suggest a blend of fiscal and operational support. For instance, Rivian's existing facilities in Illinois and California have benefited from similar state-level incentives tied to job creation and clean energy goalsUpdate on new Georgia plant - site development resumed[ 1 ].

This financial backing is critical for Rivian's ability to scale production of its R2 and R3 midsize SUVs, which are designed to compete in one of the most lucrative segments of the automotive market. By reducing upfront capital costs, Georgia's incentives enable Rivian to accelerate its timeline for achieving economies of scale, a key determinant of long-term profitability in the EV sector.

Long-Term Job Creation: A Win for Georgia and Rivian

The Social Circle plant is projected to create 7,500 jobs by 2030, with construction slated to begin in 2026 and production commencing in 2028Update on new Georgia plant - site development resumed[ 1 ]. This represents a significant infusion of high-paying manufacturing roles into Georgia's economy, aligning with the state's broader strategy to attract advanced manufacturing. For Rivian, the workforce development component of the incentive package likely includes partnerships with local educational institutions to train employees in EV-specific skills, ensuring a steady pipeline of talent.

Complementing this, Rivian's new East Coast headquarters in Atlanta, which will employ 100 people by 2025 and scale to 500 roles, further cements the company's presence in the regionCharlotte, NC RAN is now OPEN! | Rivian Forum - R1T R1S R2 …[ 2 ]. This dual approach—combining blue-collar manufacturing jobs with white-collar corporate roles—positions Georgia as a hub for Rivian's operational and strategic growth. The long-term stability of these jobs also mitigates risks associated with automation and offshoring, providing a buffer against industry volatility.

Product Diversification: Capturing Broader Market Demand

Rivian's decision to produce the R2 and R3 models in Georgia is a calculated move to diversify its product lineup and appeal to a wider demographic. The R2 and R3, positioned as more affordable and compact alternatives to the R1T and R1S, target consumers who may have been hesitant to adopt EVs due to cost or size constraints. This expansion into midsize SUVs mirrors the success of Tesla's Model Y and Ford's Mustang Mach-E, both of which have driven significant market share gains in the segmentUpdate on new Georgia plant - site development resumed[ 1 ].

Moreover, Rivian's parallel investment in charging infrastructure—such as the new RAN station in Charlotte, North Carolina—addresses a critical barrier to EV adoption. By enhancing the East Coast's charging network, Rivian not only supports its own customers but also contributes to a broader ecosystem that could accelerate regional EV penetrationCharlotte, NC RAN is now OPEN! | Rivian Forum - R1T R1S R2 …[ 2 ]. This infrastructure play is particularly astute given the Southeast's historically lower EV adoption rates compared to coastal markets.

Strategic Implications for the EV Market

Rivian's Georgia expansion exemplifies a holistic approach to market capture. The combination of state incentives, job creation, and product diversification creates a virtuous cycle: lower production costs enable competitive pricing, which drives sales; increased sales justify further investment in infrastructure and workforce development; and a robust ecosystem attracts more consumers and suppliers. This model could serve as a blueprint for other automakers seeking to scale in the EV space.

However, risks remain. Rivian must meet its 2030 job and investment targets to retain the full value of Georgia's incentives, and delays in production timelines could strain its financial position. Additionally, the R2 and R3's success hinges on Rivian's ability to differentiate its vehicles in a crowded market.

Conclusion

Rivian's Georgia expansion is more than a manufacturing play—it is a strategic investment in the future of the EV industry. By securing state incentives, creating jobs, and diversifying its product offerings, Rivian is laying the groundwork for sustained growth and market leadership. For investors, the key takeaway is clear: companies that can align public policy, workforce development, and product innovation will be best positioned to thrive in the EV era.",https://lh-prod-oper-pub-opercenter.s3.amazonaws.com/discovery-image/compress-19bd23363a0bc001.png,N,,2025-09-16 16:01:40.409746

Solar capacity has been doubling every three years for three decades, while battery storage has been nearly doubling annually since 2020.

The reality, however, reveals a fundamental difference between electrotech and fossil fuel systems: electrotech borrows materials, while fossil fuels burn them forever.
Surf the electrotech wave or be dragged under.” (p.111) Countries building electrotech capacity now will dominate the energy system of the future.","The global energy system is undergoing its most dramatic transformation in over a century. While the current U.S. administration doubles down on fossil fuels, a technological revolution is accelerating worldwide that will fundamentally reshape economic and geopolitical power. The winners won’t be determined by oil reserves, but by who can harness the power of our nearest star, the sun, and manage electrons most efficiently.

An insightful and easy-to-review report by Ember, a global energy think tank that accelerates the clean energy transition with data and policy, documents the accelerating Electrotech Revolution. It is a good news story for our children and the planet. The speed of change in what researchers call “electrotech” – solar, wind, batteries, electric vehicles, and heat pumps – is outpacing even the most optimistic forecasts. Consider solar power, which the Ember report notes has gone from the smallest to the largest source of capacity in 15 years (p. 19). The exponential growth isn’t slowing – it’s accelerating. Solar capacity has been doubling every three years for three decades, while battery storage has been nearly doubling annually since 2020.

This isn’t a gradual change. Complex energy models consistently underestimate the reality of exponential adoption. The report shows how forecasters have repeatedly lowballed both solar additions and electric vehicle sales, missing the S-curve dynamics that define technology revolutions.

The Manufacturing Base Is Being Built – Just Not Here

While America debates energy policy, the rest of the world is building the infrastructure for the electrotech era. The numbers are staggering:

Solar manufacturing capacity: Already 1,600 GW globally, far exceeding even aggressive Net Zero scenarios

Battery manufacturing: 16 TWh of capacity planned by 2028, outpacing projected demand

Geographic concentration: China dominates with 60% of global solar manufacturing capacity

The report reveals a crucial insight: The same people and places that made digital tech, mainly in China, are now making electrotech. Many electrotech leaders started in digital technology, bringing manufacturing expertise and supply chain knowledge to energy applications. This manufacturing dominance matters because electrotech follows learning curves – costs fall approximately 20% with every doubling of deployment. Technologies get cheaper with scale. Commodities get more expensive the deeper you dig. In the South, we started to build out that manufacturing base, but the Trump administration has created uncertainty and chaos in the clean technology markets in our region.

Star Power: Solar The Unstoppable Force

Solar power exemplifies why the electrotech revolution is unstoppable. The physics are undeniable: “The sun supplies more energy to Earth every five days than all fossil fuel reserves.” (p.10)

The cost trajectory is equally compelling. Solar module prices have fallen 99.6% since 1980, while oil prices have increased with cumulative extraction. Solar-plus-storage systems in India now cost $40 per MWh – competitive with the marginal cost of existing fossil plants.

But solar’s real power lies in its democratic nature. As the report highlights, 92% of countries have renewables potential over 10x their current demand. Unlike fossil fuels concentrated in specific geographies, solar potential is nearly universal, fundamentally altering geopolitical dynamics.

The Efficiency Revolution

The electrotech advantage isn’t just economic – it’s thermodynamic. Fossil fuel systems waste two-thirds of their primary energy input. Just think of all the waste heat in a gas-powered car that requires a liquid-cooled radiator. The report quantifies this staggering inefficiency: “$4.6 trillion a year goes up in smoke.”

Electrotech is three times more efficient across sectors, representing two-thirds of fossil fuel demand:

Electricity generation: Wind and solar at 100% efficiency vs. 30-40% for thermal plants

Transportation: Electric vehicles at 80-90% efficiency vs. 25-40% for internal combustion

Heating: Heat pumps at 300-400% efficiency vs. 85% for gas boilers

This efficiency advantage creates a virtuous cycle with Electrotech enabling us to get much more for much less. The entire global car fleet could run on about 13 EJ of electricity – equivalent to under 15% of current electricity demand.

Giving the Keys of Power to the Fossils is a Strategic Misstep

While the world builds electrotech capacity, America’s current energy policy, doubling down on fossil fuel, represents a historic strategic error. The report’s geopolitical analysis is stark: fossil fuel dependency creates vulnerability, while electrotech enables energy security.

Three-quarters of the world depends on fossil fuel imports, spending over 5% of GDP in many cases. Meanwhile, electrotech offers a path to energy independence: “Just a few technologies can reduce global energy imports by 70%” through renewables, EVs, and heat pumps. (p.63)

China understood this dynamic early, becoming what the report calls “the first major electrostate.” Chinese electrotech investment since 2023 totals over $100 billion in outbound foreign direct investment, building manufacturing capacity globally for the future, while America’s current political leadership is looking in the rear-view mirror.

The Coming Fossil Fuel Decline

The data suggests we’re approaching “peak fossil demand” globally, not “peak fossil availability.” The report shows fossil fuel demand has already plateaued outside China, while Chinese fossil electricity generation peaked in the first half of 2025.

This isn’t a gradual decline – it’s the beginning of structural disruption. Road transport, representing 75% of transport energy demand, faces particular vulnerability as EVs scale. The report projects: “Road transport is the soft underbelly of the oil system. Sales translate into stocks within 15 years or less.” (p.79)

The implications extend far beyond energy companies. Refineries dependent on gasoline revenues, LNG terminals facing stranded assets, and entire fossil fuel supply chains risk obsolescence.

Borrowing, Not Burning: The Mining Materials Reality

One persistent criticism of electrotech focuses on mineral requirements for batteries and solar panels. The reality, however, reveals a fundamental difference between electrotech and fossil fuel systems: electrotech borrows materials, while fossil fuels burn them forever.

The report’s analysis is striking: “The fossil fuel system requires over 50x more materials than electrotech.” (p.49) Annual fossil fuel extraction totals 17.4 billion metric tons globally, while the entire 25-year electrotech transition requires just 300 million tons of materials – and crucially, these can be recycled. Battery recycling creates a circular system impossible with fossil fuels. The report shows how mineral demand per vehicle can fall dramatically through recycling and technological improvement. With recycling rates of 90-94% achievable, and chemistry improvements reducing material intensity by 25-45% per decade, the material footprint shrinks over time rather than growing.

As the report puts it: “If you recycle batteries and improve performance, you don’t need to extract new minerals.”(p.50) A battery reaching end-of-life in 2035 provides a secondary supply for new batteries in 2045, creating a closed loop that fossil fuels can never achieve.

Catching the Wave

The report’s conclusion is unambiguous: “This is the decisive decade. Surf the electrotech wave or be dragged under.” (p.111)

Countries building electrotech capacity now will dominate the energy system of the future. Those clinging to fossil fuel strategies risk becoming energy importers rather than exporters, dependent on technologies developed and manufactured elsewhere.

The choice facing our country is clear. Continue doubling down on 20th-century energy sources while other nations build 21st-century infrastructure, or recognize that the electrotech revolution represents the most significant economic opportunity since the internet.

The manufacturing base is being built. The costs are falling below those of fossil fuels. The efficiency advantages are undeniable. The only question is whether America will participate in shaping this future or find itself buying technology from those who saw the wave coming.

The electrotech revolution is happening with or without American leadership. So many times, I have heard climate deniers say, “What about China and its emissions?” Well, China got the memo and has stepped up to the challenge. The question is whether America will lead or be led. The good news for our health, but bad news for the economy, is that the rest of the world is not waiting for us to figure it out. A safe and healthy planet depends on all of us making the transition.",https://cleanenergy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025-Featured-Imgs-Mastheads-Promos-with-image-abovetext-below-1-2.jpg,N,,2025-09-16 15:01:10.198726

Everywhere in the world, renewable energy has become the cheapest form of energy.
Unfortunately tariffs and changes in federal policies that subsidize fossil fuels over clean energy are increasing the cost RPU must pay for transitioning to clean energy in the short run.","Nearly every politician who waxes poetic about not leaving our children in debt has shown themselves to be a flaming hypocrite.

The most recent example is Rep. Brad Finstad, who voted to take away health care and food from millions of low-income families and to somehow still increase the federal debt. Our debt is now bigger than our annual economy and only growing. There is a reckoning coming, and it is going to be brutal. But there at least can be a reckoning. Financial crises are bad but survivable, and you can come out of them.

I am more concerned about the second debt that we are leaving our children: anthropogenic (human-caused) climate change. We are already experiencing climate change. It is creating massive wildfires in Canada which choke our air each summer. More frequent severe storm events and droughts are pushing already-stressed farmers over the edge. And, unlike a financial crisis, there likely is not a way to correct a climate crisis in a human time frame.

Let’s not pretend we aren’t already paying for climate change. Insurance on your home has increased significantly as a result of climate disaster-related claims. The Harvard Joint Center on Housing Studies found that from 2008 to 2024, average costs rose from about $1,150 to $2,000 annually. These are only averages and probably lower than the increases we have seen in Minnesota. Thank God we don’t live in Florida.

The Trump administration is trying hard to undercut clean energy by removing clean energy incentives and by heavily subsidizing coal, oil and gas. Nuclear energy is a good climate solution, but makes no fiscal sense. Renewable technologies are made more expensive by heavy tariffs.

In the face of all of this, Rochester Public Utilities is asking us, its customers, if we want to abandon our commitment to 100% renewable energy by 2030. I was part of the team that put this in place and I hope that subsequent leadership doesn’t fail us. I hope Mayor Norton and RPU board members are not remembered as the ones that gave up the vision.

The idea of abandoning renewable energy is as irresponsible fiscally as it is environmentally. There used to be a trade-off between cleaner energy and lower costs. Now they are aligned, and the only thing gained by sabotaging clean energy is to make our energy more expensive and remove the U.S. from a leadership position. Undercutting renewable energy also undercuts millions of jobs and revenue that support farmers and rural communities.

Battery storage technology has come a long way, and today the batteries aren't that expensive, and the technology is already working in places like California. I would encourage everyone to listen to David Roberts’ Volts Podcast to learn just how far solar and battery storage has come.

Everywhere in the world, renewable energy has become the cheapest form of energy. In 2018, the sales of fossil-fueled cars peaked and that number is falling every year. Attacking clean energy is attacking America’s leadership position and even those attacks will fail. By next year, renewables will surpass coal as the top power source in the world . Investing in new fossil fuel power generation today is the mark of a fool.

So, instead of RPU asking how it can do less, it should be asking how it can do more. RPU should be leading the charge to eliminate gas from home heating and water conditioning. A permit to install residential solar should be free and take less than 15 minutes.

Unfortunately tariffs and changes in federal policies that subsidize fossil fuels over clean energy are increasing the cost RPU must pay for transitioning to clean energy in the short run.

Sun Day is a day of action on Sept. 21, 2025, celebrating the power of clean energy. I installed solar panels on my family home long ago and look forward to the celebration. Just last week I used our gas cooktop for the very last time. I believe it is only a matter of time before the U.S. joins the rest of the world on a near-total transition to clean energy.

I was proud to be a part of the team that made RPU a leader.

Making the shift to sustainable automotive manufacturing is far from simple and requires industry-wide strategies to overcome a variety of persistent and complex challenges.

Manufacturing vehicles at scale has always been resource-intensive, with the production of heavy metals like steel and aluminum consuming vast amounts of energy and impacting the environment. Additionally, materials used throughout the manufacturing lifecycle are frequently wasted, further increasing carbon emissions and releasing harmful chemicals into the ecosystem.

Similar challenges exist regarding the management of materials at the end of a vehicle’s lifecycle. Manufacturers often struggle with inefficient and eco-unfriendly disposal processes, hindering the recovery and reuse of materials. This inefficiency increases the energy required to produce the next generation of vehicles.

These challenges are compounded by the complexity of global supply chains. Manufacturers must ensure that their suppliers worldwide engage in sustainable practices while adapting to evolving regulations and compliance obligations associated with each supplier’s location.

At Magna, sustainability is embedded into every aspect of our global business. Our ECO50 sustainability initiative, aimed at creating annual savings through energy reduction projects and on-site renewable energy generation, saved 260,000 megawatt hours of electricity last year—the equivalent of planting more than 4.6 million trees or powering approximately 24,000 homes for a year.

To reduce emissions, we have heavily invested in sustainable energy sources. In the past year alone, we tripled the number of our divisions using solar panels. In 2024, 135 divisions are using renewable electricity, and we’ll go to 150 divisions by the end of 2025. For context, it was only 29 divisions in 2021 and 61 in 2022.

One example of our energy-saving efforts is the automatic control of roof hatches at a Magna Mirrors facility in Europe. By adapting the control system to stop heating and cooling when the domes are opened manually, we saved more than 14,000 kilowatt hours per year, the equivalent of charging nearly 800,000 smartphones.

These programs underscore the importance of automotive innovation in addressing sustainable challenges and maximizing outcomes. As a testament to our efforts, Magna’s goal of achieving net-zero emissions by 2050 was verified by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), confirming that our sustainability targets align with the latest climate science.

Maximizing our use of sustainable materials and reducing waste has also been a significant focus at Magna. We’ve developed a next-generation door carrier for vehicles using up to 90% sustainable materials, achieving a 40% reduction in material weight while enhancing impact resistance to improve operator safety. Additionally, our sustainable EcoSphere seating solution leverages only recycled and bio-based materials, promoting a circular economy and setting a new standard for material recovery and reuse in the automotive space.",,N,,2025-09-16 17:02:55.562225

The discussions came as Louisiana faces decisions that could significantly shape its energy future.

Research Institutions & Private Sector Lead Change

Bobby Tudor, founder and CEO of Artemis Energy Partners, said recent global events have made clear just how dependent modern society remains on traditional fuels.

“The war in the Ukraine changed everything because it reminded the world the degree to which our society is highly dependent on our energy systems and, at this moment, highly dependent on fossil fuels,” he said.

He pointed to Houston’s business landscape as evidence of that reliance, noting that 21 of the city’s 25 Fortune 500 companies are in the energy field.

Even so, Tudor insisted that government is not the primary force behind energy’s direction. “It’s not the government that determines the direction energy will take, it’s research institutions and the private sector,” he said.

To illustrate his point, Tudor cited Texas’ surprising shift to renewables. “A few years ago, if you told people the majority of power in Texas would one day be provided by renewable energy sources, they would have laughed,” he said. “On a recent hot sunny day this year, renewables provided 71% of our grid’s power. It’s technology that changes the game.”

The Challenge Ahead

Colette Hirstius, president of Shell USA, echoed Tudor’s focus on transition while stressing the scale of the challenge.

“We need to figure out how to transition from the 80% fossil fuels we use today, which is still about one-third coal, one-third natural gas and one-third oil, and transition to lower carbon intensities and then eventually, as the system evolves and grows, transition to much more renewables,” she said.

Hirstius added that while the path to renewables will take time, the policies adopted now will determine where investment flows in the years ahead.

“The policies that we are developing today are vital,” Hirstius said. “In many cases, the investments that are required are more on the renewables and the carbon capture side. The policy that we have around oil and gas is pretty well established, so it’s in the new growth where we need policies in support of those investments to come here.”

Carbon Capture and Sequestration

Louisiana is already testing new approaches. On Sept. 15 the Louisiana Department of Energy and Natural Resources authorized the construction of its first carbon capture and storage well.

The decision came more than a year and a half after the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency gave Louisiana authority to issue Class VI permits for CO₂ injection wells, shifting oversight from the federal level to the state.

The permit, located near Hackberry and under the Black Lake southwest of Lake Charles, allows a Sempra Infrastructure affiliate to inject up to 2 million metric tons of CO₂ annually for 20 years. For Louisiana, where heavy industry drives both jobs and emissions, the project marks a significant step.

Although critics argue carbon capture is simply a way for fossil-fuel producers to keep operating while claiming to be part of the solution, industry leaders say it serves as a necessary stopgap at a time when oil and gas will remain central to global demand.

Tudor said during the Tulane Forum that population and wealth growth in Asia will keep consumption high for decades. “Demographic changes in Asia will keep the demand for oil and gas high for a further 30-40 years,” he said.

Global Shipping Fee on Greenhouse Gases

That same tension between sustained demand and the need to cut emissions is also visible at sea, where shipping companies are preparing for new climate rules.

The Getting to Zero Coalition, joined by shipping industry leaders and environmental groups, is preparing for a critical meeting in London this fall. The International Maritime Organization will convene its Marine Environment Protection Committee from October 14 to 17. At that meeting, delegates are expected to vote on the IMO Net-Zero Framework, a package of amendments to the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL) that would, for the first time, place a global price on carbon emissions from shipping.

The proposal calls for a minimum charge on each ton of carbon dioxide emitted by ships, with higher costs for vessels that exceed set thresholds. Supporters say the levy would push the industry toward cleaner fuels and new technologies while generating revenue to support climate transition efforts. They argue the policy is essential to align shipping with the Paris Agreement.

The coalition is urging member nations to back the measure, framing it as a necessary step to bring the world’s shipping fleet in line with international climate commitments. For Louisiana, with ports and energy producers deeply tied to international trade, the outcome in London could carry significant consequences.",https://assets-bizneworleans-com.s3.amazonaws.com/2025/09/Energy-Shifts-Put-Louisiana-in-the-Spotlight.jpg,N,,2025-09-16 16:02:10.824814

Studies in the U.S. and Japan tested ChargeMinder, an app developed by TRI’s Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence (HCAI) division, which incorporates insights from behavioral science.

Key findings:

In the U.S., behavioral interventions increased charging by 10% for plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) drivers.

In Japan, PHEV and battery electric vehicle (BEV) drivers shifted charging to peak renewable energy hours by 59%, adding nearly 30 minutes of daytime charging per vehicle, per day.

Interventions increased the satisfaction of U.S. PHEV drivers with their vehicles by 16 percentage points, bringing it to 100%.

“Technology is not the only way to reduce emissions — people’s choices matter too,” said Dr. Gill Pratt, Chief Scientist for Toyota Motor Corporation and CEO, Toyota Research Institute. “This research and development shows how science-based behavioral interventions can both help us reduce carbon emissions as much as possible, as soon as possible, and increase customer satisfaction.”

Why Behavior Matters

Technology is not the only path to lower emissions. To reduce their total carbon impact, electrified vehicles must be charged regularly and at the optimum times when cleaner energy sources are available. Without changes in charging behavior, vehicles like PHEVs and BEVs cannot deliver their full climate benefit.

“Behavioral science is a powerful, scalable tool to help achieve carbon neutrality,” said Dr. Laura Libby, Manager, Carbon Neutrality, Human Centered Artificial Intelligence, Toyota Research Institute. “Research in behavioral science shows that small, targeted interventions can have a large impact on people’s decisions and actions.

By securing state incentives, accelerating production timelines, and aligning with national manufacturing trends, the automaker is positioning itself to capitalize on a rapidly evolving industry while creating long-term value for shareholders.

State Incentives and Cost Structure Optimization

Georgia's incentive package—valued at $1.5 billion—includes infrastructure support and job creation commitments, reflecting the state's aggressive pursuit of EV manufacturing dominance. According to a report by the

Forums, the agreement requires Rivian to deliver 80% of its promised jobs and investments by 2030, with 7,500 direct jobs expected at the new 2,000-square-foot plant near Social CircleUpdate on new Georgia plant - site development resumed, [https://www.rivianforums.com/rivian-georgia-plant-site-development-resumed/][ 1 ]. These incentives directly reduce Rivian's capital expenditures and operational costs, enabling the company to scale production without shouldering the full burden of infrastructure development.

The financial implications are significant. By leveraging state support, Rivian can allocate resources to R&D and supply chain optimization rather than front-loading costs for factory construction. This aligns with broader industry trends, where states like Georgia are competing to attract EV manufacturers through tailored incentives, including tax credits and workforce training programsUpdate on new Georgia plant - site development resumed, [https://www.rivianforums.com/rivian-georgia-plant-site-development-resumed/][ 1 ]. For Rivian, this reduces financial risk and enhances profit margins, particularly as the company ramps production of its R2 and R3 midsize SUVs—a segment critical to capturing mass-market demand.

Production Timelines and Market Positioning

Rivian's Georgia plant is scheduled to begin construction in 2026, with first vehicles expected by 2028Update on new Georgia plant - site development resumed, [https://www.rivianforums.com/rivian-georgia-plant-site-development-resumed/][ 1 ]. This timeline is strategically designed to complement its existing Illinois facility, where R2 production has already commenced to meet early demand. By overlapping production between the two sites, Rivian mitigates bottlenecks and ensures a steady supply of vehicles, a critical advantage in a market where competitors like

and legacy automakers are grappling with production delays.

The R2 and R3 models represent a calculated pivot toward affordability and accessibility. Priced lower than Rivian's flagship R1 lineup, these SUVs target a broader demographic, aligning with the Inflation Reduction Act's (IRA) consumer tax credits for U.S.-made EVs. With Georgia's incentives and IRA benefits, Rivian can undercut competitors on price while maintaining profitability—a dual advantage that strengthens its value proposition.

Strategic Alignment with U.S. Manufacturing Trends

Rivian's expansion in Georgia also underscores its alignment with U.S. manufacturing trends, including nearshoring and supply chain resilience. The state's incentives are part of a larger policy shift to localize EV production, reducing reliance on overseas suppliers and insulating manufacturers from global trade disruptionsUpdate on new Georgia plant - site development resumed, [https://www.rivianforums.com/rivian-georgia-plant-site-development-resumed/][ 1 ].

Long-Term Value Creation and Shareholder Implications

For shareholders, Rivian's Georgia investment represents a calculated bet on sustained growth. The $1.5 billion in state incentives directly lowers the break-even point for the plant, while the 7,500 projected jobs by 2030 signal a scalable business model. Moreover, the R2 and R3's entry into the midsize SUV segment—a category projected to dominate EV sales—positions Rivian to capture market share from both traditional automakers and tech-driven rivals.

However, success hinges on Rivian's ability to meet its 2030 commitments. Delays in construction or unmet job targets could trigger clawbacks or reputational damage. Yet, given the company's track record of accelerating timelines (e.g., starting R2 production in Illinois ahead of Georgia's plant), these risks appear manageable.

Conclusion

Rivian's Georgia expansion is a masterclass in leveraging state incentives to drive cost efficiency, align with national manufacturing priorities, and scale production in a competitive EV landscape. By securing infrastructure support, optimizing production timelines, and targeting a high-growth vehicle segment, the company is laying the groundwork for sustained profitability. For investors, this represents a compelling case of strategic capital allocation—one that could redefine Rivian's role in the U.S. EV ecosystem and deliver outsized returns in the years ahead.",https://lh-prod-oper-pub-opercenter.s3.amazonaws.com/discovery-image/compress-19bd23363f0bc001.png,N,,2025-09-16 16:01:49.489292

The company intends to build a magnet plant in South Carolina by the end of 2025, which will be able to produce approximately 2,000 metric tons per year when running at full capacity. As much as 90 percent of the new American plant’s output will go to GM.

“European governments are starting to wake up slowly, but they’re far behind what America is doing,” VAC CEO Erik Eschen told Reuters. “We have a lot of technology in Europe, and what we are doing right now is transferring a lot of that technology to the United States.” VAC currently operates a magnet facility in Hanau, Germany.

Sourcing magnets from VAC in South Carolina will continue GM’s vertically integrated design and manufacturing process for its EV motors. GM designs and builds them using magnets sourced from third parties, which GM aims to make as domestic as possible to avoid trade drama with China. China still produces approximately 90 percent of the world’s rare earth materials that are necessary for EVs, wind turbines, and defense applications.

GM has been in talks with VAC since back in 2021 on an American magnet factory. The two firms signed a non-binding Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) at the time, and the original plan was to begin domestic magnet production in 2024.

The new enforcement funding was expected to raise $100 billion in revenue from corporations and individuals making over $400,000.","Key takeaways

Congressional leaders have eliminated nearly all the Inflation Reduction Act’s $45.6 billion in new funding for tax enforcement at the IRS in just three years (it was supposed to last for 10). That account is down to roughly $300 million at the end of June, with only $2.7 billion spent for its intended purpose and the rest abandoned in a series of ill-advised political deals.

This funding was essential to helping our tax system function properly by collecting the taxes owed by wealthy households and profitable corporations.

The funding boost would also have modestly reduced the deficit, since tax enforcement funding more than pays for itself. Killing it puts additional pressure on the growing deficit.

As the media and the public focus on Congressional negotiations that may or may not avert a government shutdown, Republican lawmakers are quietly luring their Democratic colleagues into weakening the IRS, just as they did during the previous government funding showdown in the spring and on several occasions before that.

Tucked in the Senate’s bipartisan FY2026 bill (S.258) to fund the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education is language rescinding $11.7 billion from the IRS’s operations budget, which had been provided by 2022’s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).

In the spring, the Republicans succeeded in eliminating virtually all the $45.6 billion provided by the IRA for tax enforcement against high-income tax cheats. Having completed that mission, they are now moving on to attack the funding for IRS operations, which affects everyone trying to file their taxes.

To find our way out of this mess, we need to understand how we got here.

The IRA provided the IRS with $80 billion in new mandatory funding designed to bolster the agency’s regular annual base funding for the next decade. While the base funding is all about “keeping the lights on” and covering the agency’s routine activities, the mandatory money was designed to be transformational, filling in long-standing gaps, upgrading 1960s-era technology, and bringing the country’s accounts receivable department into the 21st century.

Of that total, a little under half was earmarked for operations support ($25.3 billion), taxpayer services ($3.2 billion), business systems modernization ($4.8 billion), and oversight ($557.5 million).

Tax enforcement was supposed to receive the rest: roughly $45.6 billion to help the agency recoup some of the hundreds of billions in revenue lost to federal coffers due to wealthy and corporate tax avoidance. This was a smart, fiscally responsible investment which should have had broad appeal to anyone serious about addressing annual deficits. After all, as the Congressional Budget Office routinely finds, this funding pays for itself many times over.

But now an account that had once held close to $46 billion and was intended to help the IRS collect more of what is owed by rich households and profitable corporations through 2031, is down to roughly $300 million (based on expenditures through June 30) and will likely be depleted before the end of the year.

The ramifications of this successful assault on IRS funding have largely flown under the radar. But these attacks should be viewed as a tax giveaway to the ultra-rich that is every bit as egregious as the massive tax cuts for the well-off included in the recently enacted Trump megabill.

Funding tax enforcement should be a no-brainer

At first glance, ensuring that the public follows the laws that Congress has enacted seems like something Congress would support without much controversy. One might even expect that to be especially true for tax compliance, since tax enforcement raises revenue without requiring elected officials to raise existing taxes or create new ones.

A well-funded IRS fully staffed up with highly trained experts can get a huge bang for its buck, raising $12 for every $1 it spends on auditing the richest 10 percent of households. Some estimates suggest that the true benefit may be even higher when it comes to auditing the ultra-ultra-rich—closer to $26 per every $1 spent auditing the top 0.1 percent. Part of this return on investment comes through spurring improved voluntary compliance. Just like drivers tend to slow down when they’ve been dinged by a traffic camera, wealthy taxpayers tend to be more vigilant about paying what they owe in the years following an audit.

Yet attacking the IRS has been a popular GOP pastime since the Gingrich era—with “abolish the IRS” serving as a regular campaign pitch to GOP base voters. Between 2010 and 2021, the House Tea Party majority led a sustained attack on the agency that cut funding for IRS enforcement by 25 percent, leading to a 40 percent reduction in the number of dedicated revenue agents.

As a result, audit rates for large corporations fell 54 percent and audit rates for millionaires dropped by a staggering 71 percent between 2010 and 2019, according to a Center on Budget and Policy Priorities analysis of Treasury data.

Auditing regular taxpayers is easy, and relatively cheap, and although each individual audit doesn’t raise much revenue, one agent can alone handle dozens of cases. Auditing the ultra-rich, however, requires teams of experienced personnel trained in combing through complicated business arrangements, sophisticated tax shelters, and tax returns that can run hundreds of pages.

That’s why, in 2020, the last year of the first Trump administration, a grossly underfunded IRS audited low-income tax filers receiving the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) at a higher rate than it audited millionaires for the first time in history.

And as a result, the annual tax gap— the difference between what is legally owed and what is actually collected— grew. Early in 2021, IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig, appointed by Donald Trump, warned Congress that the gap could be as high as $1 trillion, and urged lawmakers to take action to improve enforcement.

Bipartisan agreement to fix the IRS fell apart

In June 2021, a bipartisan group of 20 senators unveiled a $1.2 trillion bipartisan infrastructure investment package paid for, in part, by a $40 billion increase to IRS tax enforcement capabilities. The new enforcement funding was expected to raise $100 billion in revenue from corporations and individuals making over $400,000.

Republican Senators Shelley Moore Capito and Susan Collins, for example, were quoted as saying “regular taxpayers can’t stand it when somebody is not paying their fair share,” and “providing IRS with more resources so that people who were evading taxes [pay what] they owe is a good idea.” Compared to the perceived political pain of raising new taxes, enforcing existing tax laws promised to be a win-win for members on both sides of the aisle, providing an influx of new revenue without violating conservatives’ no-new-taxes pledges.

But the bipartisan enthusiasm for enforcing our nation’s tax laws was soon short-circuited by the same special interests that had benefited from the IRS’s decline in the first place. As Politico reported that May, “Conservative groups have launched a campaign of TV ads, social media messages and emails to supporters criticizing the proposal to hire nearly 87,000 new IRS workers over the next decade to collect money from tax cheats.” Soon, anti-IRS messages were flooding the airwaves with ominous warnings that Biden’s IRS was “aggressively coming for every dime they can grab from your house.”

Eventually Senate Republicans backed away from IRS funding and the bipartisan infrastructure package was eventually enacted without tax enforcement funding and with a $256 billion revenue shortfall built in.

Inflation Reduction Act to the rescue

Despite this setback, the Biden administration remained committed to its plan to overhaul the IRS through an infusion of new mandatory funding (on top of its annual discretionary funding) that would ensure the agency had the resources to modernize its aging technology, improve customer service, and crack down on wealthy and corporate tax avoidance and evasion.

And so, in the summer of 2022 a pared-down version of the Biden tax plan was enacted as the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). IRS enforcement funding was one of the few tax provisions that made it into the final bill (along with an important corporate alternative minimum tax)—and the one designed to ensure the successful implementation of the Act’s other tax provisions.

In the heady months that followed, the IRS dove into cracking down on rich tax cheats and rolled out an ambitious 10-year spending plan that envisioned hiring “hundreds of employees in the coming years with skills to undertake those audits and to transform the agency’s technology to better spot noncompliance.”

Despite the inherently slow nature of hiring highly skilled personnel, the administration’s focus on auditing the ultra-rich paid off relatively quickly. By fall of 2024, the Biden IRS had announced that it had recovered $1.3 billion from “high-income, high-wealth individuals,” including $172 million from 21,000 wealthy taxpayers who had not filed tax returns since 2017.

To reduce the debt, cripple the taxman?

To best understand how the IRA money for tax enforcement disappeared, we need to travel back to 2011. As the economy struggled to recover from global financial collapse, President Obama faced an extremist House Republican majority threatening to default on the federal debt unless he agreed to deep spending cuts. He capitulated, and the resulting Budget Control Act unleashed years of chaos across the federal government, negatively impacting everything from federal research to transportation and infrastructure.

This was also a cautionary tale about legitimizing debt-limit hostage-taking. Two years later, Obama warned against creating “a situation in which each time the United States is called upon to pay its bills, the other party can simply sit there and say, ‘Well, we’re not going to pay the bills unless you give us what we want.’ That changes the constitutional structure of this government entirely.”

By 2023, with the lingering economic effects of the Covid-19 pandemic playing the same role that those of the Great Recession had 12 years before, the circumstances were once again ripe for an extremist House Republican majority to hold a first-term Democratic president hostage as he grappled with a global economic crisis. After months of suggesting that he wouldn’t negotiate over the debt limit, President Biden suddenly changed course and agreed to a deal with Speaker McCarthy.

In exchange for suspending the debt limit until January 2025, the deal—a mixture of immediate legislative changes and informal “sidecar” agreements designed to guide future legislation—would impose unrealistically low caps on discretionary spending, create new red-tape bureaucracy for older adults receiving food assistance, claw back billions in unspent Covid relief funds, and cut over $20 billion of IRS’s mandatory funds over the next two fiscal years.

A wolf in sheep’s clothing

The first official cut was deceptively small, rescinding only $1.4 billion of the IRS’s IRA enforcement funds.[1] Since most observers focused on the IRA’s headline figure of “$80 billion” for the IRS, this seemed like a drop in the bucket. But the real cuts were coming next, and the real total wasn’t $80 billion, it was just shy of $46 billion—the amount designated for enforcement.

Here’s how the deal was supposed to work: House Republicans would agree to boost non-defense discretionary spending above the so-called Fiscal Responsibility Act’s caps in upcoming appropriations bills. In exchange, Senate Democrats would cut the IRS’s IRA enforcement money by $10 billion in Fiscal Year 2024 and another $10.2 billion the next fiscal year. This sleight of hand would let Republicans pretend they were “paying for” the boost to non-defense spending, even as the real-world effect was to slash revenues and increase the deficit.

But it didn’t work that way. Instead, in January 2024 with a partial government shutdown looming, House Republicans and Senate Democrats struck a deal that would keep the topline spending level, but only with additional concessions from Democrats— including frontloading all of the planned IRS rescissions into the first fiscal year, leaving the question of Fiscal Year 2025 unresolved.

Each side messaged the deal differently, with Democrats arguing that the IRS cuts that Biden had agreed to were now fulfilled and Republicans claiming they’d won “an additional $10 billion in cuts to the IRS mandatory funding” with more cuts to come in Fiscal Year 2025.

Advocates cautioned Democratic leadership that the deal was a bad one, noting that it created a $70 billion hole in the budget that Congress would have to fill “simply to maintain spending at current levels and Speaker Johnson is already predicting additional IRS cuts next fiscal year.”

“This is why,” the advocates continued, “it’s essential for you to unequivocally state your strong opposition to any further reductions in IRS funding.”

But the administration assured its allies in Congress that the IRS could easily absorb the cuts, and that it would simply reduce by two years the 10-year runway created by the IRA. That argument was based on the highly implausible notion that it would be easy enough for a future Congress to simply provide more IRS funding in another six years, despite the previous two decades of underfunding. But it was enough to convince Democratic leadership and senior appropriators.

With the topline question settled, Congress passed a Fiscal Year 2024 omnibus appropriations package in March that included the entire $20.2 billion IRS rescission in one fell swoop.

And thus the transformational account had become a piggybank— and not only at the legislative level. Behind the scenes, IRS leadership was also transferring funds out of the enforcement account to backfill gaps in other parts of their base budget, in part to ensure the public’s experience with tax filing season went off without (too many) hitches.

As bad as it looked to outside observers, the reality was worse.

IRS cuts on autopilot

In September 2024, Congress passed a continuing resolution (CR) extending Fiscal Year 2024 policies and funding levels through December (it would normally have ended September 30). Unfortunately, passing a CR instead of writing a new appropriations package comes with its own complications.

As the name suggests, a continuing resolution simply extends the previous year’s language, unless an explicit exception (an “anomaly” in congressional parlance) is included to strip out or alter that language. The 2024 law included a $20.2 billion rescission to IRS funding, so absent an anomaly, the old language automatically replicated itself for the new fiscal year, like a dangerous mutation that gets passed on every time a cell replicates.

The CR didn’t formally rescind the IRS’s funding by an additional $20.2 billion, but it did block the agency from obligating any of those funds during its duration.

White House staff and Democratic leadership explained to advocates that they hadn’t put up a fight over the IRS anomaly in September because the IRS could survive until December without facing a shortfall. But, they promised, in December they would absolutely stand their ground.[2]

In December, reeling from the election results, Democratic leadership once again declined to fight for the anomaly, arguing that the IRS could make it until March without facing a shortfall. Besides, they said, there was no need to fight over the anomaly right then, because Republicans would have to write a new bill come March regardless, and that new bill wouldn’t carry the bad “mutation” of the IRS cuts.

When pressed, appropriators noted that while Republicans could technically carry forward the IRS cuts by simply extending the 2024 language again, “that’s not how it’s ever been done.”

It doesn’t take an astute political scientist to guess what happened next.

Republican leadership crafted a CR that stealthily repeated in Fiscal Year 2025 the $20.2 billion cut to IRS that was included in Fiscal Year 2024—along with a host of other highly partisan provisions—and then dared Senate Democrats to blink. Senate Democrats blinked. And just like that, a $45.6 billion account was slashed by 92 percent.

Combined with the IRS’s spending, the mandatory enforcement account is close to gone, if not entirely gone. And Republicans, impressively, didn’t have to do much of anything at all to win their number one biggest priority: protecting rich tax cheats.

[1] The legislative text of the Fiscal Responsibility Act allowed the rescission to be withdrawn across a number of IRS’s IRA accounts, but the Biden Administration chose to pull the entire rescission from enforcement, specifically Section 10301(1)(A)(ii) of the IRA.","https://media.itep.org/cdn-cgi/image/format=webp,onerror=redirect/https://media.itep.org/IRS-funding-blog-cover-1024x576.jpg",N,,2025-09-16 15:01:48.044328

ONE founder and CEO Mujeeb Ijaz told Crain’s on Tuesday that the move is the result of EVs failing to launch in the U.S. at the previously predicted scale.

“Our contracting effort on automotive looks to be delayed by several years based on the current macro condition, and we’ve just adjusted our business to manage that,” Ijaz told Crain’s in an interview.

ONE made a major splash in fall 2022 with plans to be the first U.S.-based company to establish a domestic lithium iron phosphate battery plant. The factory — backed by $237 million in taxpayer subsidies — was to feed EV-crazed automakers with a less costly, more sustainable battery than the standard nickel-manganese-cobalt chemistry.

But demand for EVs failed to launch, automakers pulled back investment dramatically and the business case for battery plants imploded. The Trump administration’s rollback of EV tax credits and fuel emission regulations has further chilled electrification in the auto industry.

ONE will continue to operate its cell production pilot line in Van Buren Township. The company has created about 70 jobs and invested $117.6 million in eligible costs under its deal with the state. It employs a total of 180 people in Novi.

Per terms of the contract, ONE has until December 2029 to meet its investment and jobs commitment. The cash it has received from the state was not dependent on creating jobs, but on meeting private financing benchmarks.

The MEDC is in regular contact with Our Next Energy and reviewing “potential impacts to the incentive agreement,” spokeswoman Danielle Emerson said.

“While the jobs requirement milestone for this project is not due until December 2029, we are being proactive in working with ONE to ensure the agreement reflects any updated scope of the project,” Emerson said. “In the meantime, no new disbursements will be made under the current agreement.”

The statement continued: “We are optimistic about the company’s path forward given the potential benefit from the federal One Big Beautiful Bill tying tax credits to domestic content … The MEDC is committed to protecting those disbursed public dollars and ensuring this opportunity stays in Michigan.”

ONE has been treading water since its Series C fundraising round fell through at the end of 2023, but notably, the company has avoided total collapse — a fate that has befallen many EV companies and projects over the past couple of years.

Most recently, Australian mining giant Fortescue scrapped plans for a $210 million EV battery factory in Detroit that had been expected to create up to 600 jobs, citing “current policy settings and market conditions.”

Ijaz also pointed to regulatory upheaval as a force delaying EV growth in the U.S.

“Basically, a lot of noise in the system in the last six months regarding tariffs, incentives, customer demand, all of the interest rate, economic considerations have just pushed the automotive market out, and we just can’t predict how long that will be,” he said.

Ijaz said the company aims to achieve break-even by the end of next year. The CEO has been focused on reducing cash burn and finding revenue streams. While its long-term goal is landing a major auto contract, its primary focus now is energy storage systems for the power grid. It is also working to grow business in other sectors including defense and even locomotives.

The company declined to disclose revenue or the state of its fundraising efforts. Ijaz said he is confident that Our Next Energy has enough runway to see through to brighter days in the auto sector.

ONE’s non-binding agreement with Ashley Capital to develop an automotive battery factory next to its current building remains in place when that time comes, Ijaz said. It did not make sense to pay millions of dollars to lease all of the current space without using it. The new development would be built taller and specifically for battery manufacturing, unlike the current one.

Ijaz also remains confident that LFP technology will withstand the test of time even as auto companies work furiously for the next tech breakthrough.

“I don’t believe iron phosphate is a chemistry that is going to be forgotten for the advancement of some other chemistries,” he said. “It is safe, it is very durable, it is cost-effective, using materials that are abundantly available around the world, and it is well industrialized now around the world.”",https://s3-rd-prod.crainsdetroit.com/styles/1200x630/s3/230518_OurNextEnergy_168.jpg,N,,2025-09-16 14:01:31.681486

The money-losing California-based company breaks ground Tuesday east of Atlanta despite President Donald Trump’s successful push to roll back electric vehicle tax credits. Starting Sept. 30, buyers will no longer qualify for savings of up to $7,500 per car.

Rivian Chief Policy Officer Alan Hoffman said the company believes it can sell electric vehicles not for environmental or tax incentive reasons, but because they’re superior.

“We did not build this company based upon federal tax incentives,” Hoffman said. “And we’re going to prove that we’re going to be successful in the future.”

Georgia plant is key to a mass market and profitability

The Georgia plant, first announced in 2021, is Rivian’s key to reaching profitability. Now the company makes the high-end R1T pickup truck and the R1S sport utility vehicle in Normal, Illinois, as well as delivery vans for Amazon and others. Its truck prices start at $71,000.

The Illinois plant will begin making smaller R2 SUVs next year, with prices starting at $45,000. An expanded Illinois plant will be able to assemble 215,000 vehicles yearly. But if the R2 is a hit, and if Rivian successfully produces an even smaller R3, it will need more capacity. The company has said the Georgia operation will be able to make 200,000 vehicles yearly starting in 2028. It plans another 200,000 in capacity in phase two, volume that would spread fixed costs over many more vehicles.

The projections would be a big leap from the 40,000 to 46,000 vehicles Rivian expects to deliver this year, down from 52,000 last year. The company says it’s limiting production now in part to launch 2026 models.

“For Rivian, it’s do-or-die time,” said Alex Oyler, North American director of auto research firm SBD Automotive. “We saw with Tesla that the key to profitability is scale, and you can’t scale if your cheapest vehicle is $70,000. So they need that plant online to achieve a level of scale of R2 and ultimately R3.”

Challenges in the electric vehicle market

Sales growth is slowing for electric vehicles in the United States, rising only 1.5% in 2025’s first half, according to Cox Automotive.

Tesla accounted for almost 45% of U.S. electric vehicle sales in that period, according to Cox. But the giant is losing market share as others gain: General Motors’ slice of American EV sales has climbed to 13%. By comparison, Rivian had a 3% share in the first half of the year, behind Tesla and six traditional automakers.

But excluding Tesla, Rivian is the most successful of the startup automakers.

The company initially tapped a largely unfilled niche: demand for electric pickups and SUVs. But the competition now includes Ford’s F-150 Lightning and the electric Chevrolet Silverado.

After an initial public offering in 2021, Rivian shares have fallen by more than 80%, while automaker shares overall have outpaced the broader stock market. Rivian lost $1.66 billion in 2025’s first half.

At the same time, some automakers’ ardor for electric vehicles is cooling. Stellantis last week canceled Ram’s electric truck program. Ford has delayed production at a new Tennessee plant. And General Motors abandoned plans to build electric vehicles at a suburban Detroit plant.

“With all the competition out there in this market and the slowing growth of EVs, it does not play in Rivian’s favor,” said Sam Fiorani, a vice president at AutoForecast Solutions. “However, there still is an EV market out there.”

$1.5 billion in incentives for 7,500 jobs

Georgia has pledged $1.5 billion of incentives to Rivian in exchange for 7,500 company jobs paying at least $56,000 a year on average. Rivian can’t benefit from most incentives unless it meets employment goals, but the state is already spending $175 million to buy and grade land and improve roads.

Georgia Republican Gov. Brian Kemp, who has said he wants to make Georgia “the electric mobility capital of America,” acknowledges Rivian faces bumps, but says he remains confident the company can fulfill its promises.

While Tesla has thousands of employees in California and Texas, some new electric vehicle plants have sputtered. Two separate EV makers that hoped to assemble vehicles in a former GM plant in Lordstown, Ohio, went bankrupt. Georgia’s Hyundai complex near Savannah is faring better, with production underway. However, a battery plant there has been delayed by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement arresting 475 people on site, including more than 300 South Koreans.

Rivian was supposed to be making trucks by now at the 2,000-acre (800-hectare) site near Social Circle, about 45 miles (70 kilometers) east of Atlanta. As the company burned through cash in 2024, it paused construction. But German automaker Volkswagen agreed to invest $5.8 billion in Rivian in exchange for software and electrical technology. And then-President Joe Biden’s administration in November agreed to loan Rivian $6.6 billion to build the Georgia plant.

Despite the Trump administration’s hostility toward EVs, Hoffman said Rivian hopes the U.S. Department of Energy will distribute the loan money, arguing it will boost domestic manufacturing.

Some neighbors still oppose the plant

Rivian also faces opposition from some residents who say the plant is an inappropriate neighbor to farms and will pollute the groundwater.

“I planned on dying and retiring on the front porch and the biggest project in Georgia has to go next door to me, of all places in the country?” asked Eddie Clay, who lives less than a mile away. He says his well water turned mud-choked after excavation at the Rivian site.

There are other challenges for Rivian, including tariffs costing $2,000 per vehicle, the Trump administration ending a tax-credit program that will cost the company $140 million in revenue this year, and long-term threats from low-priced, cutting-edge Chinese EVs. But Hoffman says Rivian is “in this for the long haul.”

“We think that we can compete with anyone out there and that once given the opportunity, we’re going to excel,” he said.

The clean energy industry understood the memo to be a clear effort to block the buildout of a huge range of projects, including by causing such extended delays that projects couldn’t meet the window to be eligible for tax credits, which had been newly shortened by the GOP’s “One Big Beautiful Bill.” According to data from the Bureau of Land Management, as of January there were at least 48 wind, solar, and generator tie line projects proposed on public land, totaling 25.4 gigawatts of power.

One potentially unintended consequence of the wide-reaching memo, however, is its impact on clean energy projects built on Tribal lands, which are sovereign lands held in trust for federally recognized Tribes, and are separate from federal public land managed by agencies like BLM. In the wake of the memo, federal employees at the Department of Indian Energy, which supports federally recognized Tribes in executing energy projects, told Latitude Media that they were concerned that it could mean wind and solar projects seeking funding from the office would also be stonewalled.

It’s a question that DOI has yet to answer, despite calls from Tribal clean energy advocates for the office to clarify its stance.

Dr. Crystal Miller, who leads policy and government relations for the Alliance for Tribal Clean Energy, said that from a Tribal perspective, the memo as written was a “re-institutionalization of paternalism over Tribal Nations.”

“This additional review layer makes it even harder for Tribes to meet timelines for federal grants, and projects on Tribal lands often already require right of ways, leases, and even cultural resource reviews, all of which are directly named in the memo,” Miller said.

In practice, the memo is creating a bottleneck for Tribal projects, most of which are relying heavily on federal tax credits, she added.

Meanwhile, Tribes are more impacted by the early phase-out of those credits under the OBBB than most, Miller said, because they already face higher permitting hurdles thanks to overlapping jurisdictions.

“This additional review layer makes it even harder for Tribes to meet timelines for federal grants and tax credits,” she said. “The result is Tribal clean energy projects will be delayed or blocked outright, clearing the way for fossil fuel projects that are not subject to equivalent secretarial-level oversight.”

Campaigning for clarity

Miller explained that Tribal Nations face significantly higher energy burdens than other communities; according to the Department of Energy, Tribal communities endure 6.5 times more outages than the national average.

For more reliable energy, solar projects, both community-scale and rooftop, are often the most accessible forms of energy for a Tribe to build, she added: “They directly reduce utility bills and even allow, in some instances, Tribal Nations to actually have electricity for the first time.”

The DOI memo is already having a dampening effect on Tribal activity at the federal funding level, Miller said. The Alliance has already heard from some Tribes that they’re discouraged from applying for funding opportunities.

For example, over the summer the federal Bureau of Indian Affairs issued a solicitation for proposals for projects “that conduct resource inventories and assessments, feasibility studies, or other pre-development studies necessary to process, use, and develop energy and mineral resources.” The grant, called the Energy and Mineral Development Program, had $8.5 million to disburse to up to ten projects. But as far as Miller and the Alliance are aware, only one Tribe applied for funding to build clean energy.

In the weeks since the release of the memo, the Alliance’s goal has been to get “clarification” from DOI that Tribes are not included in the new review requirements. “We have been calling on Tribes to really reach out to their representatives, to have conversations with Secretary Burgum and his staff, and to request that…they clarify that Tribes are not being swept up in this,” Miller explained.

To date, there’s been very little movement on clarifying the memo. But Miller said the Alliance is still hopeful, partly because Burgum and his staff are taking meetings with Tribal-led coalitions on other topics.

Into the midst of this uncertainty, the Government Accountability Office earlier this month dropped a report recommending changes to federal procedures to reduce barriers for Tribes developing energy projects. The subject of the report is the DOE Tribal Energy Financing Program specifically, which was designed by the wider Loan Program’s office in collaboration with the Office of Indian Energy. But the challenges identified in the report, such as lack of access to capital and systemic barriers to accessing federal programs, mirror those that Miller has experienced in the Alliance’s work with DOI — ones that are already being worsened by the July memo.

New partners

The new approval process isn’t the only hurdle facing clean energy developments on Tribal land; Miller said that 100% of the Tribes that her organization works with rely on some form of federal funding to build clean energy projects.

That means the general uncertainty around disbursement of federal funding is taking a serious toll. Major sources of funding in recent years have included EPA’s now-cancelled Solar For All program, the Grid Deployment Office’s Tribal Transmission Infrastructure Planning Program (T-TIPP), and the Grid Resilience Formula Grant.

The latter is a cost match program established under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which offers $2.3 billion, spread over five years, to states and Tribes for grid resiliency projects. There are two years and about $1 billion left in that program, Miller explained, but today those funds are in limbo. In December, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, which operates the program, issued a notice of intent to open the next round of funding by February 2025. As of August, though, Miller said Tribes haven’t heard any updates, and it’s not clear what will happen with that funding source.

Ultimately, the Alliance’s biggest question is whether any federal funding at all will be available for clean energy on Tribal lands. If that funding comes with additional hoops to be jumped through, Tribes will work through those, Miller said. But if funding simply isn’t available from the federal government, Tribes will have to pivot.

“The conversation that we’re all having is, ‘where do we turn to next?’” she explained. “We were accustomed to seeing a lot of different grant opportunities coming down from the federal level… but now if it’s no longer on the table, it’s really about removing the blinders. Where weren’t we looking in the past?”",https://www.latitudemedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Latitude-1920px-32-Image-2025-09-16T123405.457.jpg,N,,2025-09-16 14:01:18.084131

For now, U.S. installations fall far short of what would be required for grid-scale backup, and 80% to 90% of those batteries are tied up in vehicles or homes, rarely connected to the grid.

That imbalance is beginning to shift. The Connected Solutions program in the northeast U.S. already links more than 70,000 residential and commercial batteries, while China is weighing a nearly 1 TWh vehicle-to-grid network. If the United States tapped its 300 million passenger vehicles, averaging 100 kWh each, the result would be about 30 TWh of mobile storage. With U.S. annual electricity use at roughly 4,300 TWh, that’s almost three days of backup power parked in driveways and parking lots.

California’s residential batteries are projected to reach nearly 4 GW of power capacity by the mid-2030s. Since residential batteries average about 2.5 hours in duration, that translates to roughly 10 GWh of stored energy, a scale comparable to multiple gas plants. State regulators have taken notice.

The Demand Side Grid Support (DSGS) program, launched in 2022, pays households to share part of their behind-the-meter storage during high-price hours and emergencies. According to the Brattle Group’s new analysis, The Demand Side Grid Support Program: An Assessment of Scale and Value, DSGS has already enrolled 700 MW of battery capacity, comparable to a large gas plant, and could nearly double to 1,300 MW by 2028.

Brattle’s modeling shows that between 2025 and 2028 the program will cost about $196 million but deliver $223 million to $402 million in benefits, producing net savings of up to $206 million. The benefits come from capacity and energy supplied during the 35 highest-priced “energy events” on California’s grid—hours that would otherwise be met by expensive, high-emission gas peaker plants.

One such event occurred on June 27, 2024, when a peak grid emergency triggered the Tesla Energy distributed battery fleet. Output jumped from zero to nearly 70% of enrolled capacity in just two hours, highlighting the responsiveness of residential batteries.

Source – Brattle Report

Beginning in 2025, defined DSGS events will be triggered when the California Independent System Operator (CAISO) day-ahead energy price exceeds $200/MWh, or during systemwide emergencies. Households that participate earn annual capacity payments of $62.10 to $82.80 per kilowatt, based on actual capacity delivered to the grid. Roughly 90% of total program costs are these payments to participants, with the remainder covering administration.

In total, Brattle estimates that $178 million in homeowner payments will offset $220 million to $399 million that would otherwise go to gas plant operators.

On July 29, 2025, California conducted its largest virtual power plant test—possibly the largest in the world. More than 100,000 distributed batteries sustained an average output of 539 MW over a two-hour period. Tesla units supplied 459 MW and other manufacturers 81 MW. Sunrun managed 68% of the fleet, Tesla Energy another 174 MW, with the rest spread across smaller aggregators.

Source – Brattle Report

The combined output shaved about 1.9% of California’s peak demand during the event. This is capacity typically supplied by gas peaker plants, which often cost several hundred dollars per megawatt-hour, and at times thousands, compared to average wholesale prices of $20 to 80/MWh.

The first virtual power plants were launched by sonnen in 2018 in Germany, and later recognized in the U.S. when the New England Independent System Operator approved Sunrun for a 5 MW facility.

As Donald Trump rolled down the 18th fairway at his Turnberry golf resort in July, he was troubled by a deathly vision, slowly spinning in the Scottish distance: wind turbines. “These things are massive, and you’re looking at these ugly windmills, and it’s a shame,” Trump lamented in an interview with the New York Post—yet another salvo in the president’s escalating war on wind energy and other renewables.

“It’s a con job saying the environmentalists want it, because I can’t believe they really want it,” Trump went on. “It kills the birds, ruins the look, they’re noisy. If you see them from your house, your house is worth like 50 percent or more less. I just think it’s a very bad thing.”

At Trump’s side on the course was his son Eric, who oversees his father’s golf empire as executive vice president of the Trump Organization. But a few months earlier and an ocean away, Eric had inked a remarkable series of deals in a very different industry, becoming a major player in a complex network of cryptocurrency ventures that could become a vast new source of family wealth. Key to his plans: a brand new bitcoin mine powered by a wind farm in the Texas Panhandle and a merger with a crypto company that once billed itself as “a pioneer in the realm of zero-emissions bitcoin mining.”

The bitcoin mine—known as the Vega Data Center—is a 162,000-square-foot building that will be packed to the rafters with thousands of high-end computers, cooled with water. The computers’ task is, quite literally, to print money. They’ll churn their way through increasingly complex algorithms, which, as they’re solved, release new bitcoins into the world. Bitcoin, the world’s marquee cryptocurrency, now has a market price well above $100,000; it’s a potentially lucrative project, but an enormously energy-hungry one.

That’s where wind power comes in—the Vega center was built over the last year next to the Canadian Breaks wind farm, a 200-megawatt facility in North Texas. Since 2019, the wind farm had supplied inexpensive green energy to Texas’ power grid. But last year, the farm’s owners agreed instead to sell the facility’s energy to a subsidiary of a company called Hut 8, which owns that new bitcoin mine. The deal was a triumph for Hut 8. Crypto mining is profitable only if the electricity it runs on is cheap, and, the company’s CEO told investors, the new mine “benefits from some of the lowest locational wholesale power prices in North America.”

So this past spring, when he struck a deal with Hut 8, Eric Trump became a power player in the worlds of both renewable energy and crypto mining—interlocking industries whose fortunes are being reshaped by his father’s presidency. His timing couldn’t have been better. He was locking in a low-cost source of clean power just as the Trump administration was ramping up a campaign to block construction of new wind projects around the country.

In late May, Eric and his brother Don Jr. took the stage at the annual Bitcoin Conference in Las Vegas—and they had a message the crowd loved. America was now a pro-bitcoin country, and their father was a pro-bitcoin president who was going to do what he could to make American bitcoin dominant.

“We’re bringing bitcoin to America and America is going to win the crypto revolution—that much I can tell you!” Eric enthused. “We finally have a competent president in the White House. And we have a president who loves this industry. And who is behind this industry 100 percent!”

Eric wasn’t saying this as a simple emissary of his father’s political movement, delivering good news to the crypto-­loving conference-goers. He was gloating about the cleverness of American Bitcoin, a new crypto company he’d recently launched with a handful of partners. Eric and Don Jr. were onstage with two of those partners—Matt Prusak and Mike Ho—hyping bitcoin and the possibility that it would keep growing in price.

It’s not illegal for the Trump kids to run a crypto empire, says Noah Bookbinder, president of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. But the potential conflict of interest is obvious: The president and his administration “have had a lot to say about the crypto industry and whether it should be regulated and how it should be regulated.”

“The American people have always been troubled by the idea that families would want to profit from the presidency or connection to the president,” Bookbinder adds.

Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency to break into the public consciousness and remains one of the most valuable and sought-after digital coins. When it was established, its anonymous creator designed it to be a finite resource that would slowly be distributed through “mining.” By solving complex mathematical problems that validate other bitcoin transactions, new bitcoins can be unlocked and claimed—a process that at first was simple and easy, but, by design, has become increasingly difficult. Once something that could be done by a hobbyist with a home PC, bitcoin mining is now the domain of investors who tie together the computing power of hundreds of servers to slowly grind away at unlocking new wealth.

While it’s still possible to have a crack at mining your own bitcoin, realistically, the vast computing power needed to make any significant headway requires hardware and energy on an industrial scale. It’s akin to the difference between a frontiersman panning for gold and a multinational conglomerate excavating it from a milewide pit. These days, crypto mining consumes so much electricity that it rivals the energy needs of entire cities—one recent study found that combined, the 34 largest bitcoin mines in the United States used one-third more electricity than all of Los Angeles. As new mines are established, it’s the equivalent of adding whole neighborhoods worth of energy consumption.

“I don’t know if you could call it an industry; they just take electricity and create bitcoin,” says Colin Read, a professor at SUNY Plattsburgh who has studied the environmental economics of crypto.

Crypto mining is almost entirely unregulated in the United States, and the formula for turning a profit is relatively straightforward. “If bitcoin’s prices go up and energy prices go down, you make a lot of money,” says Del Wright, a Louisiana State law professor who generally opposes new environmental rules on crypto. “It’s really a forecast on the cost of energy versus the cost of bitcoin, because you’re speculating on both.”

Still, few in mainstream finance have expressed an interest in the mining business; the demand for energy quickly becomes overwhelming, and the price of bitcoin is too unstable for most investors. For years, it was primarily done by huge server farms in China, where energy could be had for rock-bottom prices. But after the Chinese government turned against crypto, the US suddenly became a viable option—especially if you have the kind of access to cheap electricity that Eric Trump has secured in Texas.

Without hard assets backing it, the value of bitcoin is largely driven by interest and enthusiasm from investors. And the easiest way to generate that enthusiasm just might be a president who is relentlessly excited about promoting crypto—and relentlessly opposed to tightening restrictions on it.

That describes Trump, who has promised to defend Americans’ sacred right to mine for crypto and has even established a “strategic bitcoin reserve” for the US government. It’s a sharp departure from Joe Biden’s administration, which had generally cracked down on crypto, proposing strict regulation of the industry as a whole and floating the idea of a 30 percent tax on mining operations. Since Trump’s election last year, the price of bitcoin has skyrocketed.

There’s nothing simple about the Trump family’s ties to crypto. There are the $TRUMP and $MELANIA meme coins and a line of NFTs bearing the president’s likeness. There’s World Liberty Financial, the Trumps’ decentralized crypto-finance exchange that has spun its own sprawling web of controversies. But the new bitcoin mining project might be the most byzantine of all.

It began with Don Jr. and Eric Trump joining a small investment bank called Dominari Holdings. Based in Trump Tower, Dominari is a publicly traded entity that began life as a pharmaceutical firm called AIkido Pharma before rebranding in 2022 as a financial services company. On January 21, the day after Donald Trump returned to office, Dominari’s stock was selling for just $1.41 a share after years of sliding since its rebirth. A few weeks after the inauguration, Don Jr. and Eric were announced as members of Dominari’s advisory board. They were each initially awarded 250,000 shares of the little bank’s stock, and eventually a total of 750,000 shares each—a stake that quickly ballooned to a value of nearly $10 million but has since slid to less than $5 million. Dominari is now trading around $6 per share.

Within a week, Dominari created a new company—working alongside the Trumps, though it’s unclear what their ownership stake might be—called American Data Centers. With the stated goal of becoming a leader in the world of giant server farms that power AI and crypto, it wasn’t yet clear to the public exactly what the operation might look like.

On March 31, the publicly traded bitcoin mining company Hut 8 announced it would buy the majority of American Data Centers, which it would rebrand as American Bitcoin. With Eric Trump as its new chief strategy officer, American Bitcoin now had a purpose—it would begin accumulating bitcoin by directing high-powered computer servers to unwind the complex algorithms.

American Bitcoin wouldn’t own any bitcoin mining machines itself—it would use equipment belonging to a different subsidiary of Hut 8. That includes the computers at Hut 8’s mammoth Vega Data Center in Texas, powered by dozens of neighboring wind turbines.

Eric’s new company will essentially serve as a digital vault for all this newly created bitcoin. In theory, as the value of the bitcoin it owns rises—through the slow creation of new coins and, hopefully, an ever-rising bitcoin market price—American Bitcoin’s value will grow with it.

Dominari Holdings and Hut 8 are themselves both publicly traded. Their new company, American Bitcoin, has also now gone public—a huge potential gold mine for its investors, including Eric and Don Jr. But going public is a difficult and onerous process if you follow the normal route of an initial public offering. To be successful, an IPO often requires teaming up with a traditional Wall Street powerhouse, like Goldman Sachs or JP Morgan, and months or years of scrutiny and paperwork.

Instead, the partners chose an easier path—a merger with an already public company in need of a new purpose. In May, Eric Trump, Dominari, and Hut 8 announced that American Bitcoin was merging with Gryphon Digital Mining, a publicly traded but relatively low-profile bitcoin mining company. The new entity is 98 percent owned and fully operated by American Bitcoin and uses that name—Gryphon’s shareholders got 2 percent of the stock and no role in the new business.

American Bitcoin, Hut 8, the Trump Organization, and the White House did not respond to requests for comment. Dominari declined to comment.

It’s a long and winding path, but it ends with Eric helping to lead a public company whose plan is to become more and more valuable with every noisy whir of a server’s fan, every watt of energy, every pro-crypto utterance from his father—and every turn of a wind turbine alongside the Vega mine.

The question of where to get the electricity this expanding empire requires is a tricky one, but at least initially, Eric Trump and his partners are turning to one of his father’s greatest bêtes noires: renewable energy. Despite Donald Trump’s well-documented loathing of green power, it has a lot of upsides for bitcoin mining—once the infrastructure is built, the cost of producing wind, solar, and hydro power is extremely low.

That’s why Eric and Don Jr. have found themselves in business with companies that are very pro–green energy. The Hut 8 data center at the core of American Bitcoin’s business was built next to the Canadian Breaks wind farm; last year, Hut 8 reached an agreement giving it “exclusive access” to buy the energy the wind farm produces to power its mining equipment. And that equipment, according to SEC filings, will now be used for American Bitcoin’s mining business.

Gryphon—the publicly traded company subsumed into American Bitcoin—has its own long-standing commitments to green energy, boasting that its electricity use has been “certified as 100% renewable.” Its website touts its adherence to ESG, the “environmental, social, and governance” business principles that investors in Don Jr.’s orbit—along with the rest of the MAGA movement—tend to vilify as “woke” capitalism. Gryphon had previously announced plans to pair natural gas-powered data centers with carbon capture technology, and as recently as last spring, it pitched the idea that its bitcoin mining operations could be “the knight in shining armor” helping to support green energy development.

In reality, the armor might not be so shiny. Crypto mining operations gobble up limited clean power resources while driving up prices for everyone else, says Read, the SUNY economist. Long before its association with bitcoin mining, the Canadian Breaks wind farm was supplying enough clean energy to power thousands of homes in Texas. But now it will be sending all that electricity to Eric Trump’s bitcoin machines instead.

“They’re not green crusaders,” Read says. “Solar and wind are some of the cheapest power sources available if you can get the permit for them, but if all of that is going to crypto, it just means it’s not going to you and me.”

Meanwhile, the president and his allies in Congress have thrown up major new roadblocks and phased out tax incentives for renewable energy development, meaning that all those turbines could become increasingly difficult to replace on the power grid. The administration has repeatedly halted construction of new wind farms, including a nearly finished project off the coast of Rhode Island that was slated to provide enough power for hundreds of thousands of New England homes beginning next year. The result of all this, according to Bloomberg, is that deployment of new wind, solar, and battery infrastructure could fall by as much as 41 percent by 2028.

Across the country, utilities are reportedly raising rates for consumers, citing the increased demand from AI and crypto mining. Beyond his research, Read has firsthand knowledge of the drawbacks of mining—for four years, he was the mayor of Plattsburgh, New York, which had extraordinarily low electricity rates thanks to the nearby Niagara Falls hydro plant. When bitcoin miners approached the city around 2016 about building a facility similar, though smaller in scale, to the one American Bitcoin will be operating, local officials got on board. But according to Read, the new mine generated virtually no meaningful economic value for the city, while sending electric bills soaring with its huge demand for energy.

Read, who has published a book on the impacts of bitcoin, says the idea that the Trumps or anyone else in the mining industry are building anything of economic substance is an illusion.

“There’s almost been nothing like it,” Read says. “It’s an industry that uses that incredible amount of power, in a pretty small footprint, and yet employs very few people.”

He points out that in both mining and AI support, a facility that consumes as much as half a gigawatt of electricity—enough to power a large manufacturing plant—might employ fewer people than a McDonald’s.

“We usually think of industry as job creation. That’s why a lot of these communities are bending over backwards for data processing units for bitcoin or AI—because they think it will somehow translate into jobs and tax bases, but it simply doesn’t,” he says.

None of those pitfalls have dissuaded the Trumps. The president has thrown the full weight of his office behind crypto—everything from slashing SEC enforcement to undoing rules on crypto exchanges. And the first family’s tireless efforts to hype the industry have likely contributed to bitcoin’s rising price.

“The fact that some of his kids are getting in, I would say they have an expectation of how those things are going to move,” says Wright, the Louisiana State law professor. “If you’re around somebody who has access to levers of power, they can probably give you a better forecast of certain things.”

This past summer, the White House released a new crypto policy roadmap endorsing a long list of industry priorities. The report, which Wired described as “everything the industry ever wanted,” derided Biden’s “regulatory overreach” and trumpeted the end of Washington’s “enforcement-­first approach” to digital currency.",https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/506_BITCOIN-MINING.gif?w=1200&h=630&crop=1,N,,2025-09-16 16:01:36.757167

If all goes to plan, Fourth Power plans to deliver commercial-scale batteries to customers in 2028 at a cost that could undercut both lithium-ion batteries and peaking natural-gas plants.
That’s twice as long as most grid-scale lithium-ion batteries are designed for.
To build that project, Fourth Power has raised $20 million in a round it’s calling a Series A Plus, the company exclusively told TechCrunch.
Ultimately, Fourth Power hopes that once it hits large-scale production, the cost of storing electricity using its thermal batteries will fall to $25 per kilowatt-hour, one-tenth the cost of lithium-ion batteries.","Fourth Power’s take on long-duration energy storage sounds like something out of a James Bond film. The thermal batteries come complete with superheated liquid tin and argon-filled hermetically sealed chambers. The company’s goal, though, is far more prosaic — to store electricity cheap enough to make solar and wind an obvious choice for 24/7 power.

Here’s how the technology works: To store energy, electricity from the grid heats blocks of carbon inside insulated chambers filled with argon gas. When power is needed, the system pumps molten tin heated to a scorching 2,400°C (4,352°F) through graphite pipes — the only cost-effective material that can withstand those temperatures. Special solar panel-like devices called “thermophotovoltaic cells” then convert the heat back into electricity by capturing the white-hot tin’s infrared light.

The four-year-old, Cambridge, Massachusetts, startup has been refining the technology for the last two years, and it’s now preparing to build its first full-scale battery, molten tin and all. If all goes to plan, Fourth Power plans to deliver commercial-scale batteries to customers in 2028 at a cost that could undercut both lithium-ion batteries and peaking natural-gas plants.

“Our projections are for the first-of-a-kind — the first ones to market — that they’ll be cost competitive,” Arvin Ganesan, Fourth Power’s co-founder and CEO, told TechCrunch. “Our comps for these markets are very high.”

In normal operation, Fourth Power envisions charging and discharging daily, providing continuous electricity for around eight hours or more. That’s twice as long as most grid-scale lithium-ion batteries are designed for. The insulation system, made from petroleum coke (a waste product from oil refining), keeps temperatures remarkably stable, losing only 1% of stored energy per day.

The company is currently running extensive testing on smaller versions of the system. “We’re now running cycles to make sure that we’re getting the expected amount of power out and to ensure the system is durable,” Ganesan said.

Alongside those tests, the company is designing a 1-megawatt-hour demonstration battery. To build that project, Fourth Power has raised $20 million in a round it’s calling a Series A Plus, the company exclusively told TechCrunch. The round was led by Munich Re Ventures with participation from Breakthrough Energy Ventures and DCVC. The startup previously raised a $19 million Series A in 2023.

Ultimately, Fourth Power hopes that once it hits large-scale production, the cost of storing electricity using its thermal batteries will fall to $25 per kilowatt-hour, one-tenth the cost of lithium-ion batteries.

“There’s not a lot of moving pieces. There’s not a lot of players in the supply chain, which means that you can get to cost targets in a fairly straightforward way,” Ganesan said. “We feel the $25 target is fairly straightforward to achieve.”",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/8r3.MRdYIitF3Y2Hx4OMOQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD03ODU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/techcrunch_finance_785/08afd70031c3cd91937812d68e77a8ae,N,,2025-09-16 16:01:19.898703

ATLANTA — It seems like a terrible time to build an electric vehicle plant in the United States, but Rivian Automotive leaders say they’re confident as the company starts long-delayed work on a $5 billion facility in Georgia.

The money-losing California-based company breaks ground Tuesday east of Atlanta despite President Donald Trump’s successful push to roll back electric vehicle tax credits. Starting Sept. 30, buyers will no longer qualify for savings of up to $7,500 per car.

Rivian Chief Policy Officer Alan Hoffman said the company believes it can sell electric vehicles not for environmental or tax incentive reasons, but because they’re superior.

“We did not build this company based upon federal tax incentives,” Hoffman said. “And we’re going to prove that we’re going to be successful in the future.”

Georgia plant is key to a mass market and profitability

The Georgia plant, first announced in 2021, is Rivian’s key to reaching profitability. Now the company makes the high-end R1T pickup truck and the R1S sport utility vehicle in Normal, Illinois, as well as delivery vans for Amazon and others. Its truck prices start at $71,000.

The Illinois plant will begin making smaller R2 SUVs next year, with prices starting at $45,000. An expanded Illinois plant will be able to assemble 215,000 vehicles yearly. But if the R2 is a hit, and if Rivian successfully produces an even smaller R3, it will need more capacity. The company has said the Georgia operation will be able to make 200,000 vehicles yearly starting in 2028. It plans another 200,000 in capacity in phase two, volume that would spread fixed costs over many more vehicles.

The projections would be a big leap from the 40,000 to 46,000 vehicles Rivian expects to deliver this year, down from 52,000 last year. The company says it’s limiting production now in part to launch 2026 models.

“For Rivian, it’s do-or-die time,” said Alex Oyler, North American director of auto research firm SBD Automotive. “We saw with Tesla that the key to profitability is scale, and you can’t scale if your cheapest vehicle is $70,000. So they need that plant online to achieve a level of scale of R2 and ultimately R3.”

Challenges in the electric vehicle market

Sales growth is slowing for electric vehicles in the United States, rising only 1.5% in 2025’s first half, according to Cox Automotive.

Tesla accounted for almost 45% of U.S. electric vehicle sales in that period, according to Cox. But the giant is losing market share as others gain: General Motors’ slice of American EV sales has climbed to 13%. By comparison, Rivian had a 3% share in the first half of the year, behind Tesla and six traditional automakers.

But excluding Tesla, Rivian is the most successful of the startup automakers.

The company initially tapped a largely unfilled niche: demand for electric pickups and SUVs. But the competition now includes Ford’s F-150 Lightning and the electric Chevrolet Silverado.

After an initial public offering in 2021, Rivian shares have fallen by more than 80%, while automaker shares overall have outpaced the broader stock market. Rivian lost $1.66 billion in 2025’s first half.

At the same time, some automakers’ ardor for electric vehicles is cooling. Stellantis last week canceled Ram’s electric truck program. Ford has delayed production at a new Tennessee plant. And General Motors abandoned plans to build electric vehicles at a suburban Detroit plant.

“With all the competition out there in this market and the slowing growth of EVs, it does not play in Rivian’s favor,” said Sam Fiorani, a vice president at AutoForecast Solutions. “However, there still is an EV market out there.”

$1.5 billion in incentives for 7,500 jobs

Georgia has pledged $1.5 billion of incentives to Rivian in exchange for 7,500 company jobs paying at least $56,000 a year on average. Rivian can’t benefit from most incentives unless it meets employment goals, but the state is already spending $175 million to buy and grade land and improve roads.

Georgia Republican Gov. Brian Kemp, who has said he wants to make Georgia “the electric mobility capital of America,” acknowledges Rivian faces bumps, but says he remains confident the company can fulfill its promises.

While Tesla has thousands of employees in California and Texas, some new electric vehicle plants have sputtered. Two separate EV makers that hoped to assemble vehicles in a former GM plant in Lordstown, Ohio, went bankrupt. Georgia’s Hyundai complex near Savannah is faring better, with production underway. However, a battery plant there has been delayed by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement arresting 475 people on site, including more than 300 South Koreans.

Rivian was supposed to be making trucks by now at the 2,000-acre (800-hectare) site near Social Circle, about 45 miles (70 kilometers) east of Atlanta. As the company burned through cash in 2024, it paused construction. But German automaker Volkswagen agreed to invest $5.8 billion in Rivian in exchange for software and electrical technology. And then-President Joe Biden’s administration in November agreed to loan Rivian $6.6 billion to build the Georgia plant.

Despite the Trump administration’s hostility toward EVs, Hoffman said Rivian hopes the U.S. Department of Energy will distribute the loan money, arguing it will boost domestic manufacturing.

Some neighbors still oppose the plant

Rivian also faces opposition from some residents who say the plant is an inappropriate neighbor to farms and will pollute the groundwater.

“I planned on dying and retiring on the front porch and the biggest project in Georgia has to go next door to me, of all places in the country?” asked Eddie Clay, who lives less than a mile away. He says his well water turned mud-choked after excavation at the Rivian site.

There are other challenges for Rivian, including tariffs costing $2,000 per vehicle, the Trump administration ending a tax-credit program that will cost the company $140 million in revenue this year, and long-term threats from low-priced, cutting-edge Chinese EVs. But Hoffman says Rivian is “in this for the long haul.”

“We think that we can compete with anyone out there and that once given the opportunity, we’re going to excel,” he said.

Diamond Green Diesel sources tallow from multiple countries, and Reuters was unable to determine how much of it came from ranches in illegally-cleared land in the Amazon.
In 2023, Araguaia exported $4.4 million worth of beef tallow from the Amazon to Diamond Green Diesel, according to trade data from Import Genius.","A Texas refinery that supplies green fuel to U.S. airlines has been purchasing animal fat from cattle raised on illegally cleared lands in the Amazon rainforest, according to a Reuters review of government tracking data, interviews and eyewitness accounts.

Louisiana-based Diamond Green Diesel, a joint-venture between biofuels producer Darling Ingredients and petroleum refiner Valero Energy, has invested hundreds of millions of dollars into a refinery in Port Arthur, Texas that turns cattle fat—called tallow—into a cleaner alternative to petroleum-based jet fuel and diesel.

Diamond Green Diesel is a major player in the U.S. sustainable fuels market. It has collected over $3 billion in U.S. tax credits for producing biofuels since 2022, according to filings.

But interviews and documents show at least two Brazilian factories that supplied Diamond Green Diesel with tens of thousands of tons of cattle fat since 2023 are sourcing some of it from slaughterhouses that have bought animals from illegally deforested ranches in the Amazon rainforest.

Carriers such as JetBlue and Southwest Airlines, which struck deals with Valero to use the “green” jet fuel, can claim credit for lowering their emissions because Diamond Green Diesel’s plant is certified under a United Nations agreement curbing the impact of aviation on the climate called CORSIA.

The global market for sustainable jet fuel is small, about $2.9 billion in 2025 according to analysis firm SkyQuest Technology Group, compared to the $239 billion global market for conventional aviation fuel. But government incentives are expected to help the market grow exponentially, pumping more resources into the Brazilian cattle industry, the leading driver of the destruction of the Amazon rainforest.

Pedro Piris-Cabezas, an economist at the nonprofit Environmental Defense Fund, said any additional demand “could result in the expansion of herds and directly or indirectly drive deforestation and forest degradation.”

It could also violate Brazilian law. “Companies that profit from raw materials originating from a supply chain that involves deforestation, are also responsible for these illegalities,” said Ricardo Negrini, a Brazilian federal prosecutor who has opened a number of government investigations into the cattle industry.

Diamond Green Diesel, Darling Ingredients, Valero Energy, Southwest and JetBlue did not reply to multiple requests for comment, including detailed questions about the Brazilian tallow supply chain.

To track the tallow trade from illegally deforested ranches in the Amazon to Diamond Green Diesel, Reuters partnered with the nonprofit investigative outlet Reporter Brasil, which helped review court documents that link slaughterhouses to the tallow plants, corporate filings, trade data, and government cattle tracking records.

Reuters also interviewed over a dozen people involved in each step of the beef tallow supply chain, including traders, truck drivers, prosecutors, auditors and regulators.

Diamond Green Diesel sources tallow from multiple countries, and Reuters was unable to determine how much of it came from ranches in illegally-cleared land in the Amazon.

In 2022, Darling Ingredients CEO Randall Stuewe announced the $557 million acquisition of several plants in Brazil, including four in the Amazon region, that would supply “waste fats to be used in the production of renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel,” according to a statement issued at the time.

Reuters found one of those rendering plants in Para state, called Araguaia, sourced cattle fat from at least five meatpackers that failed a May 2025 audit conducted by federal prosecutors for slaughtering 20,000 cattle from illegally deforested areas.

In 2023, Araguaia exported $4.4 million worth of beef tallow from the Amazon to Diamond Green Diesel, according to trade data from Import Genius.

In June, a Reuters journalist saw a truck with an Araguaia logo inside the Sao Francisco slaughterhouse, which failed an audit for buying cattle from farms on illegally deforested land.

The driver of the truck, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told Reuters he had been picking up carcasses at the Sao Francisco slaughterhouse and delivering them to the Araguaia plant for two years. Two other drivers and two Sao Francisco employees confirmed the slaughterhouse was an Araguaia supplier.

Sao Francisco didn’t confirm or deny that it is a supplier of the Araguaia plant. It said it has been cooperating with federal prosecutors since 2018 and that it hired an outside firm to monitor its supply chain.

Sao Francisco sources some of its cattle indirectly from Vale do Paraiso, a farm that had been blocked from grazing cattle since 2006 because 15 square miles of trees had been illegally razed, according to Brazil’s environmental protection agency, Ibama. Cattle tracking data shows that the cattle was moved from Vale do Paraiso to a farm with a clean record before it reached the slaughterhouse.

The agency unblocked Vale do Paraiso last year because a court determined that the statute of limitations had expired, but its owner Antonio Lucena Barros still owes over $3 million in fines for the deforestation there, according to government documents.

Barros’ lawyer Calebe Rocha said in a statement that his client is fighting the fines in court and has been granted an injunction that suspends the payment of the fine. He also said that no animals were sold from the part of Vale do Paraiso that Ibama had blocked due to deforestation.

Another plant owned by Darling Ingredients sourced fat from a slaughterhouse that confirmed to Reuters that it bought hundreds of cattle in 2022 and 2023 from rancher Bruno Heller, who Brazil’s Federal Police has described as possibly the Amazon’s biggest deforester in a 2023 investigation.

In a statement, Heller’s lawyer Vinicius Segatto said Brazil’s environmental law is “excessively rigorous” and that the criminal case against his client is ongoing.

Fat to fuel

Airlines have been under pressure to buy more green jet fuel, which is now produced in tiny quantities, to meet industry targets of net zero emissions by 2050.

Supporters of the use of tallow as a biofuel assert that demand for it alone is unlikely to push ranchers to clear rainforest to grow their pastures because of its economic value – less than 3% of what slaughterhouses get for each animal.

Diamonds’ imports from Brazil were certified as sustainable by the International Sustainability and Carbon Certification (ISCC), a third-party certification body that approved Diamond’s plant for CORSIA.

To be eligible, biomass used for fuel cannot come from land that was deforested after 2008 or protected areas, but the ISCC told Reuters it did not investigate Diamond’s supply chain because it considers tallow a “byproduct” of the beef industry under CORSIA.

Three experts who helped design CORSIA told Reuters that the program allows producers to omit the score for carbon emissions and deforestation of the Amazon rainforest because it assumes demand for tallow is unlikely to push ranchers to grow their herds.

The International Civil Aviation Organization declined to comment when asked about whether it viewed deforestation in the tallow supply chain as a violation of its sustainability standards.

However, the agency said it is “constantly monitoring the compliance” of third-parties responsible for certifying sustainable aviation fuel producers and welcomes information on “any potential deviations” for further evaluation.

Gavin Newsom that came forward in the final days of the California legislative session.

The measures that extended proceedings into Saturday include legislation that clears the way for California to join a regional electric grid, tries to boost statewide oil production in the wake of a pair of looming refinery shutdowns, extends California’s cap-and-trade program and replenishes the state’s wildfire funds.

The bills head to now head to the governor’s office, where Newsom has until Oct. 13 to sign them into law.

By all indications, that will be a mere formality.

“After months of hard work with the Legislature, we have agreed to historic reforms that will save money on your electric bills, stabilize gas supply, and slash toxic air pollution — all while fast-tracking California’s transition to a clean, green job-creating economy,” Newsom said when the raft of last-minute bills were introduced.

Regional grid

Assembly Bill 825, originally known as Senate Bill 540, will enable California to join a new energy trading market with other states in the West. By more easily tapping into power in the region, the bill’s supporters say it will lead to lower energy costs for consumers and more seamlessly integrate power supplies.

The California Independent System Operator that manages the electric grid for about 80% of the state, took to social media and hailed the bill’s passage as “a major milestone for the West” that was “shaped by years of successful and evolving regional collaboration.”

AB 825 passed 34-0 in the Senate on Friday and 74-1 in the Assembly on Saturday.

But critics worry that joining a regional grid with other states that don’t all share California’s decarbonization goals could link the Golden State with those like Wyoming that use coal-fired power plants.

“This concerns us because the federal government has recently forced customers in other regional markets to pay increased costs to prop up fossil (fuel) generation facilities at risk of retirement,” Lee Trotman, communications director for The Utility Reform Network, known as TURN, said in an email. “TURN asks each policymaker to do everything you can to make sure, that TURN’s warnings about AB 825 never come to pass.”

Boosting in-state oil

Senate Bill 237, which also zoomed through the Legislature with large bipartisan support, passed amid worries that California’s already high gasoline prices may climb even higher.

Phillips 66 plans to shut down its twin refineries in Carson and Wilmington by the end of this year and Valero recently gave notice it will shut down operations at its refinery in the Northern California city of Benicia by 2026. The Valero and Phillips 66 facilities combine to account for roughly 18% of the state’s crude oil capacity.

In the wake of the pending closures, the California Energy Commission sent Newsom a series of recommendations to bolster stability to the petroleum market.

SB 237 includes provisions aimed at increasing crude oil production in the state, particularly in the Bakersfield area where the largest concentration of derricks are located.

“This legislation will protect consumers from supply disruptions, provide investor confidence in the state’s energy sector and ensure Kern County continues to lead with both environmental responsibility and energy reliability,” the Kern County Board of Supervisors said in a statement.

But a coalition of environmental groups decried SB 237, saying it runs counter to the state’s clean energy goals.

“More in-state drilling will not prevent inevitable refinery closures or guarantee lower gas prices,” said the group that included Sierra Club California, the Natural Resources Defense Council and California Environmental Voters. “Additional permits will not change the fact that California oil fields are in decline, nearly completely depleted, but will worsen racial and climate injustice.

Keeping cap and trade going

Since 2013, California participates in a cap-and-trade program that requires power plants, natural gas providers and large industries that emit greenhouse gases to buy permits on the carbon pollution they produce.

The Legislature over the weekend passed Assembly Bill 1207, which extends the program for the next 20 years, and Senate Bill 840 that will distribute the estimated $60 billion to $90 billion of revenue among various air, water and fire prevention programs aimed at reducing emissions.

The legislation also earmarks $20 billion that will go to the state’s controversial and expensive high-speed rail project.

“By aligning the future of cap and trade with the timeline of California’s ambitious emission reduction targets, California is positioned to achieve its climate goals in the most cost-effective way possible,” said Katelyn Roedner Sutter, California state director of the Environmental Defense Fund.

AB 1207 renames the cap-and trade program as the California Cap-And-Invest Program.

Despite the passage of AB 1207 and SB 840, a large number of Republicans voted against the two bills, with some complaining about the lack of funding for agricultural projects in the program.

Wildfires and utilities

A wide-ranging piece of legislation, Senate Bill 254 raises $18 billion to shore up the state’s Wildfire Fund, which some worry will get depleted after January’s deadly fires in the Los Angeles area.

Under SB 254, the state’s big investor-owned utilities (including San Diego Gas & Electric) would combine to pay for half of the $18 billion total while electricity customers across California would pay the other $9 billion over a 10-year period.

The bill also creates low-interest loans to cover the construction of new transmission lines and prohibits utilities from earning a rate of return on the first $6 billion they spend on their upgrades on wildfire prevention.

Those provisions and others, SB 254’s supporters say, can help reduce monthly electric bills for customers across the state.

“There are pieces that some of us like and some of us don’t,” Sen. Aisha Wahab, D-Fremont, told Politico, “but this is a very large collaboration.”

A Critical Choice for America’s Climate Future The EPA’s plan to end the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program is a major shift in U.S. climate policy.","The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has proposed ending the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP). The agency says this move could save businesses up to $2.4 billion in compliance costs over the next ten years.

If approved, about 8,000 large facilities would no longer be required to report their greenhouse gas emissions. These businesses currently have to share data if their emissions exceed 25,000 tons of CO₂ equivalent each year.

This proposal follows President Trump’s executive orders on his first day in office, which focus on cutting regulations and promoting energy production.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin explained that,

“Alongside President Trump, EPA continues to live up to the promise of unleashing energy dominance that powers the American Dream. The Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program is nothing more than bureaucratic red tape that does nothing to improve air quality. Instead, it costs American businesses and manufacturing billions of dollars, driving up the cost of living, jeopardizing our nation’s prosperity, and hurting American communities. With this proposal, we show once again that fulfilling EPA’s statutory obligations and Powering the Great American Comeback is not a binary choice.”

Turning Point for America’s Climate: EPA’s Bold Move to Scrap Greenhouse Gas Reporting

The EPA argues that the GHGRP creates “burdensome red tape” without helping improve human health or protect the environment. The agency says this data doesn’t directly lead to rules that regulate emissions or enforce climate action.

The proposed rule would remove reporting requirements for facilities across many industries—power plants, refineries, steel mills, cement factories, and landfills. The public would no longer have access to self-reported emissions data from these sources.

Reporting for petroleum and natural gas companies would also be suspended until 2034. This aligns with recent law changes that delayed methane fee collections. Only small parts of the petroleum sector would still be required to report emissions for future adjustments.

According to the EPA, this change would save between $2 billion and $2.4 billion over ten years. The agency believes that by reducing regulatory costs, companies can focus on real environmental improvements instead of filling out reports.

Background on the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program

The GHGRP was created by Congress in 2008 and started collecting data in 2010. It requires 47 categories of sources to report their emissions each year. The goal was to improve transparency and track trends in pollution.

The Waste Emissions Charge (WEC) was added to the Clean Air Act in 2022. It imposed fees on methane emissions from petroleum and natural gas systems that exceeded certain limits. However, the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” signed in 2025 delayed this charge until 2034, meaning those companies won’t report until then.

Earlier in 2025, the EPA announced it would reconsider the GHGRP as part of a wider effort to cut regulations and boost American energy.

However, Zeldin said that rolling back GHGRP would still meet the agency’s legal obligations under the Clean Air Act (CAA).

What the Proposal Means

If the proposal is approved:

Nearly all large polluters, like power plants, refineries, steel and cement makers, landfills, and others, will no longer report their emissions.

Only small parts of the petroleum and natural gas sector will report, and even that is postponed until 2034.

This means that nearly all U.S. greenhouse gas reporting would stop, making it harder for the government to track emissions.

Industry’s Reaction: Mixed Support, Strong Worries

Many scientists, economists, and environmental groups worry that this move will make it much harder to fight climate change. Environmental organizations argue it can significantly weaken efforts to hold polluters accountable.

Even some business groups that support deregulation warn that without reliable data, companies and investors won’t be able to manage climate risks.

Loss of Transparency: The GHGRP is one of the country’s biggest sources of emissions data. Without it, governments, investors, and communities won’t know where pollution is coming from.

Risk of “Blind Spots”: Policymakers will have fewer tools to track pollution and design solutions. This could slow down efforts to reduce emissions.

Higher Long-Term Costs: Studies show that mandatory reporting has helped lower emissions by 20% since 2009. Without data, companies may pollute more, leading to greater health risks and economic costs later on.

Weakening Climate Agreements: The U.S. shares emissions data with other countries. Without this reporting, global trust in U.S. climate commitments could fall.

Economists warn that while companies save money in the short term, the risks from extreme weather, regulatory uncertainty, and damaged public trust could lead to bigger problems down the line.

On the other hand, some industry groups support the rollback. They say reporting rules are expensive and outdated. Cutting them would free up money for more direct investments in cleaner technology.

They believe this proposal is part of a wider effort to reduce regulations, paperwork and encourage energy production. It will create jobs, boost the economy, and let businesses invest more in real environmental solutions.

Next Steps

The EPA will open a public comment period where citizens, businesses, and experts can share their views. Instructions will be available in the Federal Register and on the EPA website. Many expect fierce debate, and legal challenges are likely if the rule moves forward.

A Critical Choice for America’s Climate Future

The EPA’s plan to end the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program is a major shift in U.S. climate policy. While it could lower costs for businesses, it also creates serious risks by making it harder to track pollution and protect the environment. As the public voices its opinions, this debate will help determine how the country balances short-term savings with long-term climate goals.

U.S. Emissions Set to Rise in 2025?

The EIA projects that U.S. energy-related carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions will rise by 1.5% in 2025, before declining by 0.5% in 2026. The increase in 2025 is driven by higher emissions from coal, natural gas, and petroleum products. Significantly, coal will be contributing the most to the growth.

However, the decline in 2026 will also be primarily attributed to reduced emissions from coal.

Overall, this deregulation decision could affect the U.S. globally. Other nations depend on American emissions data to measure progress and coordinate efforts. Without this information, the U.S. risks losing trust and influence in international climate discussions. In the end, it’s not just about cutting regulations. Ensuring accountability, leadership, and a cleaner future for all should also matter.",https://carboncredits.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/shutterstock_2268563399.jpg,N,,2025-09-16 13:01:30.143239

A decade ago, global investment in fossil fuel supply outpaced clean energy by 1.2 to 1. Today, the equation has flipped.

Clean energy receives twice as much investment as fossil fuels, driving GDP growth and creating millions of jobs. Renewable electricity has surged past 40% of the global power mix, with solar leading the way as the fastest-growing energy source in history.

Between 2023 and 2024, new solar, wind and battery capacity displaced more than 650 terawatt-hours (TWh) of fossil fuel use, more than the entire electricity consumption of South Korea.

The report highlights that electrification is also transforming energy demand across industries. Electric vehicle (EV) sales have risen from 4% to 22% of global car sales in just five years, displacing more than 1.3 million barrels of oil per day. That figure is expected to reach 5 million barrels daily by 2030.

Heat pumps and electrified industrial processes also consume three to five times less energy than fossil-based alternatives, further weakening the case for oil and gas.

We Mean Business Coalition’s chief executive Maria Mendiluce said: “The message is clear: The clean energy transition is accelerating, and fossil fuels are losing ground.

“Business and governments that continue to bank on rising demand for coal, oil and gas are taking on serious risk. The smart move now is to double down on clean energy — it is where growth, jobs and competitiveness lie.”

Fossil fuels face rising risks

The report warns that fossil fuels face mounting structural risks as renewables surge.

Oil demand is nearing a peak this decade, with high-cost producers likely to struggle as electric vehicles (EV) expand. No sector, including petrochemicals, can offset the lost consumption.

The report also highlights that gas for power is becoming uncompetitive as solar and batteries undercut new turbine projects, raising the prospect of overbuilt liquefied natural gas infrastructure. Coal’s decline is already entrenched. Planned capacity has dropped 65% over the past decade, with new projects concentrated in just 10 countries and vulnerable to early retirement.

Businesses are pressing policymakers to accelerate the shift. A survey of more than 1,400 executives across 15 countries found that more than 90% view renewable electricity as critical to new investment decisions.

Half said they would relocate operations if governments fail to support the transition.

Ember’s energy strategist Kingsmill Bond said: “The world is experiencing its most profound energy transformation since the 18th-century shift from biomass to fossil fuels.

“Across countries and sectors, electrotech is proving superior in efficiency, cost and security. It is replacing fossil fuels rather than adding to them – disrupting the fossil fuel industry while creating a new generation of electrotech winners.”",https://edienetlive.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/SolarWindRenewables.jpg,N,,2025-09-16 17:03:00.674198

In Japan, PHEV and battery electric vehicle (BEV) drivers shifted charging to peak renewable energy hours by 59%, adding nearly 30 minutes of daytime charging per vehicle, per day.

Interventions increased the satisfaction of U.S. PHEV drivers with their vehicles by 16 percentage points, bringing it to 100%.

“Technology is not the only way to reduce emissions — people’s choices matter too,” said Dr. Gill Pratt, Chief Scientist for Toyota Motor Corporation and CEO, Toyota Research Institute. “This research and development shows how science-based behavioral interventions can both help us reduce carbon emissions as much as possible, as soon as possible, and increase customer satisfaction.”

Why Behavior Matters

Technology is not the only path to lower emissions. To reduce their total carbon impact, electrified vehicles must be charged regularly and at the optimum times when cleaner energy sources are available. Without changes in charging behavior, vehicles like PHEVs and BEVs cannot deliver their full climate benefit.

“Behavioral science is a powerful, scalable tool to help achieve carbon neutrality,” said Dr. Laura Libby, Manager, Carbon Neutrality, Human Centered Artificial Intelligence, Toyota Research Institute. “Research in behavioral science shows that small, targeted interventions can have a large impact on people’s decisions and actions. Furthermore, compared to other causes of behavior change such as public charging infrastructure initiatives and consumer financial incentives, behavioral interventions are inexpensive and can be deployed quickly.”

The ChargeMinder Research App

ChargeMinder applies behavioral science to EV charging by:

Delivering just-in-time reminders — up to 50% more effective than generic prompts in laboratory studies.

Providing positive reinforcement with streaks, summaries, and encouraging messages.

Surfacing engaging educational quizzes that leverage memory science to enhance learning.

ChargeMinder integrates more than a dozen interventions based on well-replicated findings from behavioral science research that have been tailored for specific charging behavior change goals. These interventions are surfaced through in-app features and mobile push notifications. The ChargeMinder platform can also securely and anonymously ingest and surface user data from multiple sources, including vehicle telematics and charging locations. With this data, we can provide a personalized intervention experience and conduct advanced data analytics while preserving user privacy.

What’s Next

Technologies that account for how people think, feel, and behave will play a crucial role in the future of lower-carbon mobility.

TRI and Toyota’s Carbon Neutral Center plan to extend ChargeMinder research to focus on personalized, data-driven interventions, making EV charging even more consistent with Toyota’s global carbon neutrality strategy.

“This work emphasizes the importance of incorporating behavior change as a key part of a decarbonization strategy. We need to build technologies that bridge the gap between human behavior and carbon reduction,” added Manabu Handa, Assistant Manager, Carbon Neutral System Planning Department, Toyota Motor Corporation.",https://toyota-cms-media.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ChargeMinder-hero-1000x600.jpg,N,,2025-09-16 13:02:19.551353

In fact, U.S. Gulf production is expected to grow to more than 2 million barrels a day by 2026, about 40 percent higher than where it was at the start of this decade, according to energy research firm Wood Mackenzie.

At bp, we’re proud to be one of the largest investors and producers in the deepwater U.S. Gulf of America, where we have operated for more than 30 years. And we have big plans to grow our production and footprint in this critical region.

As part of bp’s strategy, we’re building capacity to safely produce more than 400,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day by the end of this decade — just one part of a larger plan to produce 1 million barrels of oil equivalent per day in the U.S. by 2030.

How will we do this?

Today, it’s about maximizing production from bp’s five existing offshore operated production platforms. There are currently plans for three major expansion projects at these facilities between now and the end of 2027. The first, Argos Southwest Extension, came online in August and is increasing production at our Argos platform, while the other two, both at bp’s Atlantis platform, are in progress. The company is also investing in new technologies, including artificial intelligence, or AI, tools, to help recover more oil from reservoirs that would not have been possible even just a few years ago.

Tomorrow, it’s about bringing online new deep water projects and investing in continued exploration for new prospects that will further grow U.S. energy supplies.

In 2024, bp announced plans to invest in a sixth platform, Kaskida, that will operate in the region. That development is expected to produce up to 80,000 barrels per day, with an anticipated start-up in 2029. And before the end of the year, we hope to announce plans for developing another major project: our seventh floating platform, which would produce oil from the Tiber and Guadalupe fields.

There have also been recent oil discoveries at bp’s Far South prospect, and we are actively pursuing other exploration opportunities.

As bp’s senior vice president for the Gulf of America and Canada, I’ve been in this business for more than 30 years, and I continue to marvel at the work our people do every day to produce the oil and gas that fuels the American economy and way of life. More than 1,300 employees at the company directly support the region.

So much of these employees’ stories — and that of the Gulf — are about innovation and technology. Whether it’s making a discovery six miles below the water’s surface, analyzing vast amounts of seismic data with the help of a supercomputer, or using drones to inspect equipment in the middle of the Gulf, the offshore oil and gas industry of today rivals space exploration in its complexity and sophistication.

The offshore industry of tomorrow — which bp is helping to lead — is just as awe-inspiring. AI tools are helping to plan maintenance jobs remotely with cloud-based virtual models of bp platforms, and machine learning is helping to detect and predict issues with offshore production equipment.

Recent passage of the federal tax bill will help ensure that the U.S. offshore industry continues to play a significant role in growing American energy production and for continued investment in America.

At bp, we commend Congress and the Administration for advancing the bill to final passage, providing more certainty and stability for offshore leasing, which is crucial to the future of U.S. energy supply. We’ll continue to work with the administration to support the delivery of American energy.

The Gulf of America has been a cornerstone of U.S. energy production for many years, and it remains a critical part of bp’s global strategy, both today and tomorrow. As we continue to innovate and invest in this region, we remain committed to enhancing energy security, driving technological advancements and contributing to the U.S. economy.

Opposition to energy mandates fueled Republican successes in the 2024 election.
This year Republicans in Congress have gone a long way towards rolling back the energy subsidies and mandates that have raised energy costs and undermined America’s energy security.
Today, RFS biofuel mandates do not displace foreign oil, they displace domestic oil.","Last week saw an important study in contrasts in the leadership of the two Senate committees with primary jurisdiction over energy policy. It illustrates a fundamental divide among Senate Republicans between the majority of members who seek to protect Americans from expensive and unworkable energy mandates and the minority who would use federal power to enrich special interests at the expense of the public. On Tuesday, Sen. Mike Lee, chair of the Senate Natural Resources Committee, introduced legislation that would make clear that burdensome fuel mandates on small refineries under the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) that are waived as instructed by Congress cannot be reimposed on other refiners. On Thursday, Sen. Shelley Capito, chair of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, helmed a hearing to advance S. 881, the Renewable Fuel for Ocean-going Vessels Act, which would expand the RFS program to include fuel for ships. One chair is working to protect Americans from energy mandates, the other is working to increase them.

The legislation from Sen. Lee, the Protect Consumers from Reallocation Costs Act, comes in response to regulatory actions from the Trump administration. In August, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced decisions on nearly 200 backlogged applications for small refinery exemptions (SREs) from the RFS dating back to 2016. The SRE waiver process for small refineries was written into the RFS program in an attempt to reduce the burden and expense of compliance with the mandate. While the RFS mandates biofuel volume blending requirements on refineries based on their percentage of total fuel production, small refineries may seek an exemption from a given year’s volumes in the event of economic hardship caused by the mandate.

Despite this clear will of Congress, many of these waivers had been held up both by dishonest assertions from presidential administrations as well as vexatious litigation from biofuel special interests. After decisions at the Supreme Court and the D.C. Circuit rejecting those efforts, EPA acted to consider and largely approve the backlogged SREs. However, in its decision approving most of the SRE applications, EPA indicated that it plans a rulemaking process to reallocate the fuel volumes that were waived and impose them on other refiners. There is no statutory support for this reallocation process; EPA is proposing to make it up as a sop to biofuel lobbyists. Sen. Lee’s legislation would nip this illegal gambit in the bud, making the implicit explicit: that the SRE process is a relief valve to reduce the burden of the RFS, not an opportunity to reimpose that burden on other refiners.

In contrast, S.881 seeks to expand the RFS, taking the costly and unworkable mandate into a new transportation sector. Republicans have touted themselves as the opponents of energy mandates for years now, precisely the opposite of this proposed legislation. Opposition to energy mandates fueled Republican successes in the 2024 election. Promises to halt EV mandates and many of the subsidies and mandates from the Biden Inflation Reduction Act proved popular with the American people. This year Republicans in Congress have gone a long way towards rolling back the energy subsidies and mandates that have raised energy costs and undermined America’s energy security. Yet on the RFS a few Senate Republicans persist in defending the outdated and unworkable program.

Back in 2005 when the RFS was first created, perhaps it was understandable to believe that biofuel use could improve national security and reduce our “dependence on foreign oil” to use a popular phrase from the time. But in the last 20 years we have eliminated our dependence on foreign oil with a surge in domestic production. Today, RFS biofuel mandates do not displace foreign oil, they displace domestic oil. Indeed, because imported biofuel is required to meet RFS mandates, the RFS today actually actively undermines our national security.

With the national security justification made obsolete, the RFS persists now only as a special interest boondoggle, enriching a small elite at the expense of regular Americans. The few Senate Republicans who still defend the program should be embarrassed by the harm it does to our economy and national security. Expanding the RFS even further would be madness. Instead, Republicans should come together and support regular working Americans who pay the price of the RFS every time they fill up their tank.",https://www.americanenergyalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/corn-gastank-2.jpg,N,,2025-09-16 20:02:13.990206

AB 825 amends California law to enable the California Independent System Operator (CAISO) to transition the governance of its markets to an independent regional organization envisioned by the multistate West-Wide Governance Pathways Initiative.

This is a significant step toward a full-service regional transmission organization (RTO), which will include centralized transmission planning, providing a unified approach to grid expansion and upgrades across a larger Western footprint.

“Rapidly expanding demand for new energy resources from data computing needs, aging transmission infrastructure and extreme weather conditions are raising the cost of electricity across the West. The stakes are high, and with passage of AB 825, we have an opportunity to collaborate and create a Western regional market for cost-effective supply of newer clean energy resources,” said Vijay Satyal, Ph.D., deputy director of markets and transmission at WRA.

Recognizing the growing energy demands in the region and the untapped opportunity to better utilize the existing resources, power companies and public officials across the West are developing day-ahead markets — a way to plan each day for the following day to ensure adequate resources at the lowest available price.

While two day-ahead markets are growing in the West — the Extended Day-Ahead Market (EDAM) and Markets+ — AB 825 offers a West-wide regional wholesale market, an important tool to influence regional decarbonization goals and strengthen grid reliability.

Last month, as it reported its second quarter financial results, the company said it expects the third quarter to be the strongest of the year.

Demand for electric vehicles in the US has surged this quarter, with the EV tax credits expiring by the end of September.

In August, leasing prices were cut for the standard variants of the 2026 R1 models, after a price spike in the prior month.

A month later, prices for the Standard version of the R1S was raised from $811 to $831 per month.

Two environmental groups are pressing ahead with their challenge to Imperial County’s approval of the Hell’s Kitchen lithium and geothermal project, a development they say risks worsening water scarcity, air pollution and cultural loss in one of California’s most fragile regions.

On appeal before the California Fourth District Court of Appeal, attorneys for Comité Cívico del Valle (CCV) and Earthworks submitted their opening brief on Thursday, Sept. 11, arguing that the county rushed the project’s approval and relied on a faulty environmental review that underestimated impacts and ignored legal obligations. The developer, Controlled Thermal Resources (CTR), has hit back forcefully, calling the lawsuit “frivolous” and insisting the project is key to Imperial Valley’s economic transformation.

The appeal comes after the original case before the Imperial County Superior Court was ruled meritless and the lawsuit was dismissed in January.

A Project With Big Promises

Located near Niland on the southeastern edge of the Salton Sea, the Hell’s Kitchen project aims to harness geothermal brine deep underground to produce both renewable electricity and lithium, which is the essential mineral used in electric vehicle batteries and grid storage.

The plan includes a 49.9-megawatt geothermal power plant, a Direct Lithium Extraction (DLE) facility, and related infrastructure to process and ship lithium products. CTR has pitched the project as part of California’s clean-energy future, promising thousands of jobs and tens of millions of dollars in local tax revenue.

But the project comes with a heavy water footprint — about 6,500 acre-feet annually — in a desert region where the shrinking Salton Sea already drives some of the state’s worst air quality.

The Appeal: Four Key Criticisms

In their opening brief, CCV and Earthworks focused first on water supply, arguing that the county’s analysis was dangerously short-sighted. The Environmental Impact Report (EIR) only examined whether water would be available for 20 to 30 years, while the project is designed to operate for 50. The Imperial Irrigation District (IID), which controls all Colorado River water in the Valley, went on record calling the county’s assumptions “inaccurate,” warning that water for the project was not guaranteed, especially in light of looming federal cuts to Colorado River allocations.

The groups also charged that the county overlooked cumulative impacts by failing to account for other projects competing for IID water. Among them are three proposed geothermal plants from BHE Renewables, as well as Imperial County’s own Lithium Valley Specific Plan, which could require more than 100,000 acre-feet of water annually. Compounding the concern, CTR announced during the review process that it intends to expand Hell’s Kitchen into a seven-stage, 190-acre lithium campus, which is a massive enlargement that was not fully evaluated in the EIR.

On air quality, appellants argued that the EIR downplayed how the project could worsen toxic dust emissions from the shrinking Salton Sea. As the lake recedes, exposed sand releases harmful chemical residues from decades of agricultural runoff, contributing to asthma and respiratory illness in nearby communities. A letter submitted by the Leadership Counsel for Justice and Accountability during the review process underscored that the neighborhoods immediately surrounding the project are already “most impacted by poor air quality” and deserve stronger protection.

Finally, the brief criticized the county’s failure to consult local tribes as required under Assembly Bill 52. Tribal Elder Carmen Lucas of the Kwaaymii Laguna Band submitted objections, stressing that the county had not adequately recognized or protected cultural resources connected to the project site. According to the appellants, requests for tribal monitors and stronger cultural protections went unanswered, leaving significant tribal concerns unaddressed.

“These omissions skewed the project’s environmental analysis, leaving critical impacts unstudied and feasible mitigation measures off the table,” the groups argue in their filing.

CTR Fires Back

CTR responded to the appeal and opening brief with a sharply worded statement, defending the project and criticizing its opponents.

“Controlled Thermal Resources is deeply saddened and frustrated by Comité Cívico del Valle’s decision to continue its frivolous legal appeal after the Imperial County Superior Court ruled that their claims had no merit and dismissed their lawsuit,” the company said. “This group’s ongoing actions are a clear abuse of the original intentions of CEQA and only serve to delay progress on clean energy projects that are essential to the community, California and the nation.”

The company argued that while environmental groups stall, other states like Nevada, Utah, Texas and Arkansas are attracting billions in investment for lithium and clean-energy projects.

“Imperial County is on the cusp of a generational transformation that includes sustainable development, thousands of good-paying jobs, and tens of millions of dollars in additional revenue every year to support infrastructure, schools, workforce training, health, and Salton Sea restoration,” CTR said. “As hard as some special interest groups try to stop this positive progress — they will fail.”

The Bigger Picture

California lawmakers have branded the Imperial Valley “Lithium Valley,” betting big on its geothermal brine as a cornerstone for the state’s clean energy transition. But the Hell’s Kitchen case underscores the challenges of balancing industrial development with fragile ecosystems, scarce water and long-marginalized communities.

Tribal leaders, community advocates and health experts say the county’s process skipped over important voices. As Elder Lucas put it in her objection, the county “failed to properly identify tribal cultural resources” and moved forward despite repeated requests for greater protections.

The appeal now before the Fourth District Court of Appeal will not only play a role in determining the fate of CTR’s flagship project, but also how Imperial County navigates the tension between economic opportunity and environmental justice in the decades ahead.",https://calexicochronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/CTR-Steam-Testing-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-09-16 12:04:02.144782

SACRAMENTO, Sept. 16, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- The California Energy Commission (CEC) has awarded Brooklyn-based EV charging company it's electric $1.1 million to develop, certify, and commercialize the world's first curbside vehicle-to-grid EV charger.

The award comes through the Enabling Electric Vehicles as Distributed Energy Resources grant, part of California's Electric Program Investment Charge (EPIC) Program, which invests in breakthrough technologies to strengthen the state's energy system and meet its ambitious climate goals. In partnership with the University of California, Berkeley and the University of Delaware, it's electric will bring the technology to market by 2028.

Unlike traditional chargers, which only pull electricity from the grid to charge a car, it's electric's new charger will also be able to push energy back from the EVdirectly to the grid. This has never before been possible in a curbside format, where millions of cars are parked every day.

California is leading the way in bi-directional curbside EV charging with the development and demonstration of this first-of-its-kind hardware. Visually identical to it's electric's current award winning design, this next generation of chargers will expand equitable access to vehicle-to-grid technology in low-income and disadvantaged communities, helping to accelerate EV adoption and reduce emissions in line with the state's climate targets.

The project will also develop a second innovative technology: the J3068 Active Cable, created with the University of Delaware. This first-of-its-kind cable integrates the SAE-standard untethered charging format with Delaware's Active Cable Communication Module, enabling bi-directional charging while seamlessly associating driver account information with the cable for reliable compatibility across a wide range of charging systems.

And as a matter of equity, all EV drivers should have equal opportunity to participate in EV charging demand-response programs and V2G energy arbitrage opportunities.""

""Vehicle electrification is about both cleaner transportation and a strong grid. This project helps unlock the full potential of EVs to provide load flexibility, support electric system reliability, and reduce peak demand,"" said Commissioner Andrew McCallister, who leads the Commission's Research and Development division. ""These are exactly the kinds of innovations California needs to build a more resilient and sustainable energy system.""

""Very pleased the California Energy Commission is funding innovations that will enable EV batteries to support our grid, power buildings and more,"" said Commissioner Nancy Skinner. ""it's electric's impressive project will pilot EV chargers that can not only power a car but also help that car power our grid, demonstrating the economic and resiliency benefits of V2G technology.""

At scale, curbside V2G chargers will allow cars that park on the street to function as distributed energy resources, delivering benefits to both EV owners and grid operators. By enabling large-scale distributed energy storage, the technology can help mitigate peak demand growth and reduce the need for costly grid infrastructure upgrades.

""The Energy, Controls, and Applications Laboratory (eCAL) team is excited to get to work on this project, and proud to be hosting deployment and testing of the world's first bidirectional curbside charger at UC Berkeley's Richmond Field Station,"" said Professor Scott Moura, Director of eCAL. ""This project will advance our ability to leverage vehicle-to-grid capabilities for grid stability, helping to create more resilient and efficient infrastructure in California.""

""The University of Delaware is proud of the role we have played to date in bringing vehicle-to-grid technologies to market,"" said Professor Willett Kempton. ""We applaud the California Energy Commission for investing in this project, which will advance the ability of all communities to take advantage of V2G opportunities.""

With the support of the California Energy Commission, it's electric and its partners are pioneering the next era of EV charging infrastructure. By combining rapid curbside deployment with groundbreaking vehicle-to-grid technology, this project demonstrates how innovation can be scaled quickly and equitably across communities. The world's first curbside vehicle-to-grid chargers will not only accelerate EV adoption but also strengthen California's energy resilience, paving the way for cities everywhere to embrace a cleaner, more reliable, and more affordable energy future.

Advocacy groups and some state agencies are increasing their efforts to address the resulting gap.

In North Carolina, federal cutbacks have impacted agencies like the EPA and NOAA.

With the Trump administration moving quickly to water down or even dismantle much of the country's environmental infrastructure, from regulations to financial support for science, advocates for issues ranging from clean energy and healthy living to environmental justice and habitat protection are moving to fill the void.

While these groups individually don't have the public megaphone and reach of federal agencies like the Enivronmental Protection Agency and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the hope is they can collectively keep the conversation going and step into the breach formerly filled by government-led groups and initiatives.

Still, the scale and speed of the federal government's retreat from environmental and health issues has been breathtaking. Moves by the Trump administration in North Carolina include plans to dissolve the EPA's Office of Research and Development in the Research Triangle Park near Raleigh and significant cutbacks to NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information campus in Asheville. The downsizing and financial cutbacks to the Federal Emergency Management Agency also has raised concerns about states' abilities to plan for and recover from natural disasters, including last year's Tropical Storm Helene that pounded Western North Carolina. Federal support for research at many N.C. universities, including the University of North Carolina Wilmington and Duke University, also have taken significant hits.

States run by Republicans also are moving to rein in environmental and health mandates, with Florida notably announcing in early September that it would end school vaccine requirements. In the Tar Heel State, the GOP-dominated General Assembly also has made some moves to backtrack on environmental commitments and policies championed by previous administrations in Raleigh. That includes a recent override of a veto by Gov. Josh Stein, a Democrat, that will see North Carolina retreat from aggressive carbon-reduction goals in the energy sector hashed out by former Gov. Roy Cooper, Republican lawmakers and Duke Energy back in 2021.

In response to all these changes, many groups and Democratic administrations have stepped up their environmental outreach and educational efforts − even as they deal with often substantial federal funding cuts. In North Carolina, that list includes the N.C. Department of Environmental Quality, Duke University, and the N.C. State Climate Office.

Transform understanding into action

One environmental group that has recently stepped up its outreach efforts is Charlotte-based CleanAIRE NC, which pushes for healthy communities by advocating for cleaner air and environmental justice.

The nonprofit has launched CleanAIRE Academy, an online interactive learning tool designed to help N.C. residents educate themselves about air quality and other environmental issues, something that's often invisible but can have tremendous health impacts. Topics that are covered by the self-paced seminars include the permitting process, understanding federal and state regulations, and how to effectively advocate for healthier communities.

According to the state's environmental agency, the two biggest air quality problems in North Carolina are ozone and particle pollution, with both pollutants primarily caused by vehicle emissions. Sustained exposure to a polluting source, say a factory smokestack, also can cause numerous health issues and irritate the lungs and respiratory system.

According to the American Lung Association's latest ""State of the Air"" report, North Carolina's ozone pollution isn't that bad, although Mecklenburg County is an outlier. But the state's particle pollution is a concern, with Mecklenburg and Davidson counties receiving a failing grade.

In a release, CleanAIRE said recent changes have raised questions about North Carolina's readiness to handle potential future environmental and climate challenges. Political and legal changes also have left communities and individuals short of resources and access to science and expert-driven analysis even if they wanted to advocate for change. In an example that hits close to home for CleanAIRE, the group in March lost a $500,000 EPA grant to test air quality in lower-income communities in and around Charlotte. The nonprofit has joined other environmental groups in suing the Trump administration to get the funding restored.

Rafi Vaca, the group's education manager, said while the genesis of the academy program started 18 months ago after officials saw public interest in environmental issues spike during the Covid lockdown, it has taken on a new urgency with recent actions in Washington. This summer CleanAIRE also launched the ""AirKeeper Dashboard,"" an interactive tool that displays historical and real-time air quality information for North Carolina, in response to the federal government ending much of its air quality monitoring work.

Vaca said the academy's learning modules and other programs have intentionally been made palatable and engaging to help ""demystify complex issues and inspire meaningful engagement.""

""What we're asking people to learn about can be heavy and emotive,"" she said, noting CleanAIRE is also stepping up its education and outreach efforts with its partner agencies. ""But ultimately it's important.""

“The only interests that benefit from undoing the endangerment finding are polluter interests, and specifically fossil fuel polluter interests,” Whitehouse said.
But the Senate committee still expects the companies to comply with their request.
Fossil fuel interests pushed back on the endangerment finding when it was first written, yet little is known about more recent advocacy to overturn it.","In the wake of the Trump administration’s announcement that it will overturn the rule which underpins virtually all US climate regulations, a Senate committee has launched an investigation into a suspected lobbying push that led to the move.

On Tuesday, the Senate environment and public works committee sent letters to two dozen corporations, including oil giants, thinktanks, law firms and trade associations. The missives request each company to turn over documents regarding the 2009 declaration, known as the endangerment finding, which the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) said in July that it will unmake.

The finding enshrined that carbon dioxide and five other greenhouse gases harm the health of Americans.

“Rescinding the endangerment finding at the behest of industry is irresponsible, legally dubious, and deeply out of step with the EPA’s core mission of protecting human health and the environment, and the American public deserves to understand your role in advancing EPA’s dangerous decision,” wrote Rhode Island senator Sheldon Whitehouse, the ranking member of the committee. “I am concerned about the role that fossil fuel companies, certain manufacturers, trade associations, polluter-backed groups, and others with much to benefit from the repeal of the endangerment finding – including your organization – played in drafting, preparing, promoting, and lobbying on the proposal.”

Fossil fuel companies and their allies are threatened by the endangerment finding because it confirms in law that carbon dioxide, which their products produce, are dangerous, Whitehouse told the Guardian. It also gives the EPA the authority to regulate those emissions under the Clean Air Act.

The letter, which asks for all relevant private communications between the day Trump was re-elected in November to the day the EPA announced plans to rescind the endangerment finding in July, was sent to oil giants Exxon, Chevron, Shell, and BP, as well as coal producers, a rail giant and two auto manufacturers, whose business plans rely on fossil fuels.

“The only interests that benefit from undoing the endangerment finding are polluter interests, and specifically fossil fuel polluter interests,” Whitehouse said.

It was also sent to trade associations and law firms representing big oil and auto companies. And it was sent to far-right, pro-fossil fuel thinktanks Competitive Enterprise Institute, New Civil Liberties Alliance, the Heartland Institute, America First Policy Institute, and the Heritage Foundation, each of which challenge the authority of federal agencies, and some of which have directly praised the proposed endangerment finding rollback.

The Guardian has contacted each recipient for comment.

Because Republicans control the Senate, Democrats on the environment and public works committee lack the power to subpoena the documents. But the Senate committee still expects the companies to comply with their request.

The letter could send a signal to polluting sectors and rightwing firms that they are being watched, and could set the stage for continued investigation if Democrats win back a congressional chamber in next November’s midterm elections.

Fossil fuel interests pushed back on the endangerment finding when it was first written, yet little is known about more recent advocacy to overturn it. Immediately following the EPA’s announcement of the rollback, the New York Times reported that groups have not “been clamoring in recent years for its reversal”. But Whitehouse believes that has changed since Trump was re-elected in November 2025.

When Joe Biden was president and Democrats controlled at least one chamber of Congress, Whitehouse said “a request to rescind the endangerment finding would have just looked like useless, pointless, madness.

“But now that they can actually do it in their desperation and with the mask of moderation pulled off, I think it’s very clear that they were directing this happen,” he said.

Under Trump, former lobbyists and lawyers for polluting industries such as oil, gas and petrochemicals have entered leadership positions at the EPA.

“The fossil fuel industry owns and controls the Trump administration on all matters that relate to their industry, and they have subservient Republicans controlling both the House and the Senate,” said Whitehouse. “The change in power has allowed a change in tactics and attitude.”

Two environmental non-profits have sued the Trump administration for “secretly” convening a group of climate contrarians to bolster its effort to topple the endangerment finding.

The EPA’s proposed undoing of the crucial legal conclusion comes as part of a larger war on the environment by the Trump administration, which has killed dozens of climate rules since re-entering the White House in January.

“The motive is to help fossil fuels survive,” said Whitehouse.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0900887899ccc9c96368b0f4cfbc7fe2239120e7/1340_0_6713_5369/master/6713.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e18c30e8a4abd26929e94f1fc59bd0c1",N,,2025-09-16 13:02:08.485826

It’s remarkable that with everything else that’s raging, climate and energy bills still managed to dominate the legislative session that just wrapped in Sacramento. After all, the reason lawmakers were still at work this past Saturday — the day after the legislative session was supposed to end — was that negotiations on climate bills pushed them into overtime.

Gov. Gavin Newsom, Senator Pro Tem McGuire, and Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas reached last-minute agreement on a package of half-a-dozen climate-related measures. “California is delivering real and lasting energy savings for families, workers and businesses,” the Big 3 announced.

The truth is messier, of course. These include bills to reauthorize the state’s cap-and-trade program to stay on track toward long-standing climate goals, but also to allow Kern County to expand oil drilling. “While Newsom and Rivas were largely aligned on tempering the state’s ambitious climate goals amid the reality of rising costs, McGuire and his staff were wary of handing wins to polluting industries without extracting victories for environmental and social justice causes,” Maya Miller, Alejandro Lazo and Jeanne Kuang report for CalMatters.

Climate policy people seem mostly satisfied, if not exactly happy, with the measures that passed. “Relieved” might be the word. Relieved that it wasn’t worse. Let’s recap how we got here.

Back in December, my UCLA Emmett Institute colleague Julia Stein predicted that “affordability” would dominate the conversation in Sacramento and outlined how climate measures are also pocketbook issues. At the time, many lawmakers were geared up to start talking about cap-and-trade reauthorization framed as both a climate and affordability issue. Then the January fires ravaged Los Angeles. The issue of rebuilding understandably sucked up all of the oxygen. Overhauling CEQA became the focus. The conversation changed again when we started seeing headlines about two California oil refineries preparing to shut down. Even a distant threat of higher gas prices in California can dominate headlines. By August, legislators returned to the subject of cap-and-trade, with just weeks left in the session. Negotiations on such a condensed timeline made it hard to grapple with some of the more radical and complex proposals to modify the program. It probably also disadvantaged environmental justice advocates who have spent years organizing in California but were largely relegated to the backseat. In the end, California reauthorized its signature climate program until 2045 with some notable new improvements to boot, as my UCLA colleague Jason Gray explains here.

Given the deregulation onslaught in 2025, that’s enough to leave climate policy people feeling relieved. “They have, collectively, found a way to get to yes on a whole series of energy legislation that taken individually would represent a massive accomplishment,” Stanford’s Michael Wara skeeted. Several environmental groups praised the cap-and-trade reauthorization while also criticizing expanded oil drilling allowances as a sellout to fossil fuel companies. “Removing environmental safeguards won’t reverse the terminal decline of California oil production but it will allow the industry to do more damage on its way out the door,” Hollin Kretzmann, an attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity said. My UCLA colleague Mary Nichols told the LA Times that the negotiated measure does seek to fend off companies looking to take advantage of offshore oil in federal waters under the oil-friendly Trump administration.

By contrast, what do Republican lawmakers in Washington have to show for themselves on energy? A lot of executive orders but not legislation. This morning, the House Energy and Commerce Committee is holding hearings on various GOP bills. They include efforts to let fossil gas projects bypass more cost-efficient wind and solar developments; to “codify an industry definition for showerheads” of all things; and to try to restrict local and state government’s authority. This at a time when American household power bills have risen 10% since Trump entered the White House and the administration has spent months trying to destroy much-needed energy projects. Energy Secretary Chris Wright admitted last month that rising energy prices could be a political challenge for the GOP ahead of next year’s midterm elections. However, a new Heatmap Pro poll of registered voters finds that Americans are more likely to blame rising energy prices on their state government and local utility than on the federal government. Voters want to see local action.

What we can say for certain about California is that legislators are at least wrestling with the messiness of the energy transition and confronting the increasing costs of climate-fueled disasters on electricity and insurance. And that shows from this vacillating legislative session.

Here are some of the notable bills headed to Newsom’s desk:

AB 1207 – Reauthorizes a Cap-and-Invest program along with the related SB 840 – which directs how the money from the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund will be spent.

SB 237 – Eases rules to increase the state’s oil production and tightens other rules to prevent oil spills.

SB 254 – Doubles the state’s wildfire liability fund to cover wildfire damage and finance mitigation efforts while looking to accelerate clean energy.

AB 39 – Requires local governments to adopt electrification plans.

AB 825 – Establishes a pathway to participate in a regional electricity market

SB 352 – Sets new rules for toxic air pollution monitoring program

SB 34 – Limits South Coast AQMD’s ability to regulate emissions from the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach.

SB 782 – Facilitates the use of enhanced infrastructure financing districts or climate resilience districts to respond to disaster events like the Los Angeles wildfires.

SB 79 – Seeks to increase housing development and density by allowing Transit Oriented Development upzoning.

As for that last one, SB 79 passing is a big “W” for the growing YIMBY movement in California. If Newsom signs the bill, it will also be a big “L” for the former reality TV influencer Spencer Pratt, who has been trying to influence California policy from his TikTok account.

Speaking of celebrities influencing policy: Another California bill, SB 682, would ban the sale and distribution of several categories of products — most notably cookware — that contain intentionally added PFAS, starting in 2028. David Chang, Rachael Ray and other celebrity chefs who sell cookware are advocating for keeping “forever chemicals” in their non-stick products. As a former line cook, cookbook author, and cast-iron enthusiast I can say with some authority that, “No chef, we do not need PFAS in our pans.”

Welcome to The Drain, a weekly roundup of environmental and climate news. Our song of the week is the “California” by Joni Mitchell. Here’s what else I see happening…

The Emissions Protection Agency

The EPA is planning to end what’s called the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program. This 15-year-old program requires the reporting of carbon dioxide, methane and other emissions data from about 8,000 power plants, oil refineries, and other facilities, Axios notes. But that could soon end. “Nothing more than bureaucratic red tape,” is how EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin describes the program. That’s blatantly false.

The data is used by businesses and others to track and compare facilities’ greenhouse gas emissions, identify opportunities to cut pollution, minimize wasted energy, and save money, the EPA’s own website reads. “States, cities, and other communities can use EPA’s greenhouse gas data to find high-emitting facilities in their area, compare emissions between similar facilities, and develop common-sense climate policies.” Plus, private companies rely on the program’s data “to demonstrate to investors that their efforts to cut greenhouse gases are working,” Maxine Joselow writes for the New York Times, “and communities often use it to determine whether local facilities are releasing air pollution that threatens public health.” This move could also cripple the oil industry’s carbon capture ambitions because it “may gut the carbon capture tax credit, at least in the short term,” Robinson Meyer writes at Heatmap News.

You cannot fight what you cannot see, and you can’t reduce what you don’t track. That may be the point. EPA’s proposal must be published in the Federal Register followed by public comment so it could be finalized within the next year. Enjoy the mapping features of this data while it’s available.

Other Pollution News

New research has for the first time linked carbon emissions from the world’s biggest fossil fuel companies to deadly heatwaves. The study’s authors examined 213 heat waves from 2000 to 2023 in the International Disaster Database, a list of global disasters reported because of casualties, economic losses, emergency declarations and calls for international assistance, Karissa Waddick reports for USA Today. “The research has been hailed as a leap forward in the legal battle to hold Big Oil accountable for the damages being caused by the climate crisis,” reports Damian Carrington for the Guardian. For example, it finds that the emissions from any one of the 14 biggest companies were by themselves enough to cause more than 50 heatwaves that would otherwise have been virtually impossible.

Tiny toxic particles spewed by Canadian wildfires killed 82,000 people in 2023, according to a study published in Nature on Wednesday. These toxic particles were even responsible for 22,000 early deaths in Europe, the Guardian reports.

The Trump administration is taking yet another shot at climate litigation, this time in Colorado. In a friend of the court brief filed last week, the Solicitor General’s office sided with Big Oil, which wants the lawsuits transferred out of state courts and sent to federal courts.

Energy

We Americans currently subsidize the fossil-fuel industry to the tune of nearly $31-billion per year, according to a new analysis by the environmental campaign group Oil Change International. The subsidies “allow the sector to receive stunning 30,000% returns on investments,” writes Dharna Noor.

Why hasn’t it been a bigger story, Emily Atkin asks, that Energy Secretary (and rich, former fracking CEO) Chris Wright just went on a “multi-day, taxpayer-funded trip to Europe to tell world leaders that the climate crisis is not really a big deal, and that the best way to protect their citizens is actually to buy more American gas”?

Even the world’s biggest petrostate is on board with solar power. Saudi Arabia is investing $8 billion into going solar, the WSJ reports, and is also investing in becoming a major supplier of critical minerals, Aya Nader writes.

Canal Power: A 1.6-megawatt installation called Project Nexus just went online in California’s Central Valley, with panels that span across canals in the vast agricultural region, reports Maria Gallucci at Canary Media.

Ocean power: The startup Eco Wave Power just installed a 100-kilowatt system at the Port of LA that uses seven steel “floaters” that bob with the waves, building up hydraulic pressure that is then converted into electric power.

Wind (Political) Power: There is one East Coast wind farm that has thus far escaped unscathed: a $10.8 billion project under construction off the shores of Virginia, where Gov. Glenn Youngkin, a Republican, has been its champion, the New York Times reports. “The governor has privately urged the Trump administration not to target the project.”

Solar Power: Texas installed 3,800 MW of new solar capacity — most in the nation — during the first half of 2025, ahead of California, Indiana, and Arizona. Meanwhile LA is falling behind: LAist and Crosstown LA analyzed permitting data and found rooftop solar installations have plummeted in the city of L.A. in recent years. The market may be saturated in terms of early adopters.

Big data centers are even less popular with neighboring residents than wind farms, according to a national poll conducted by Heatmap’s intelligence platform, Heatmap Pro.

Elsewhere in the World

Canada’s government is seriously considering eliminating a federal cap on emissions from the country’s oil and gas sector if the industry and province reduce their carbon footprint in other ways, Amanda Stephenson reports at Reuters.

Africa wants to be the “continent of solutions.” After three days of talks in Addis Ababa, African leaders have agreed to “a common climate roadmap ahead of COP30 in Brazil, Tik Root writes at Grist. The nations are pledging to present a unified position to developed nations at the global negotiations later this year.

Singapore, Japan, and European countries have all passed new measures to protect workers from extreme heat this year, Somini Sengupta and Hisako Ueno report for the New York Times.

More than two million people have been evacuated in Pakistan’s Punjab province as climate change-worsened floods sweep the country’s eastern region.

Strong demand and community solar Despite facing significant challenges from the OBBB, the US solar industry continues to thrive, driven by strong demand from data centres and electrification.","These changes are having a significant impact on US solar companies and forcing them to rethink how they do business in the country.

Alex Zhu, CEO of ES Foundry, who spoke exclusively to PV Tech Premium about this topic last week, said that the company’s business decisions have been made with the IRA tax credits in mind.

“We started ES Foundry and brought back manufacturing to the US purely because of policy, because of the domestic content adder to get the additional 10% of the ITC,” he said

Julia Bell, chief investment officer at CleanCapital, said that these tax credits were important for her company too. “Domestic content is a part of every one of our discussions, ” she said. “We’re always weighing the benefit of the adder versus the cost of purchasing domestically.”

Supply chain challenges

Regarding foreign entity of concern (FEOC) regulations, which amount to a restriction on imports of products from China, the issue of supply chain transparency has become a key concern throughout the industry.

Companies are now under pressure to track the origin of system components at every stage of production. This goes beyond meeting regulatory requirements to meet the expectations of investors and lenders.

Bell emphasised: “Transparency is really important because, as we see from our lenders and investors, everyone wants to know where the products are coming from at each step of the pathway.”

The challenge is especially severe because many manufacturers depend on intricate global supply chains, where information about subcomponents may be lacking.

Elissa Pierce, solar module supply chain analyst at Wood Mackenzie, highlighted that upstream component manufacturing has not kept pace with module manufacturing in the US. Module manufacturers mostly rely on imported components, which makes them vulnerable to tariffs, legislation and other global supply chain disruptions.

Jessica Lawrence-Vaca, chief commercial officer at Array Technologies, acknowledged the company has faced challenges confirming that its supply chain is entirely FEOC compliant, given the bill’s vagueness. Lawrence-Vaca was one of many speakers who called for the solar industry to advocate for making FEOC workable.

Other supply chain policies continue to hang over the US solar sector, including the Uyghur Forced Labour Prevention Act (UFLPA). According to Zhu: “For the whole value chain, traceability is important because we’ve seen policy challenges in the past with the UFLPA becoming an issue for all imports.”

New antidumping and countervailing duties (AD/CVD) are forcing manufacturers in China, Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam to shut down or relocate. As a result, India, Laos, Indonesia, and the Philippines are seeing a rise in solar manufacturing capacity, but even these countries have seen increased pressure from AD/CVD enforcement.

Nikita Trivedi, director of supplier management and strategic shared services at Southern Company, said the company has had to “get creative about manufacturing slotting and making progress payments to secure assets,” adding: “Power transformers have a 30-month lead time. So before my solar project is done, I have to have a transformer lined up.”

The industry is also struggling with complex ownership issues, particularly in light of the FEOC rules. Zhu explained: “Following OBBB guidance, customers coming to us about their due diligence ask, ‘What’s your ownership structure?’ ‘Who owns you?’ ‘What debt do you have?’”

’Eager to safe harbour as much as we can’

While major shakeups are occurring throughout the industry, speakers also emphasised the importance of weathering the current storm.

Bell shared: “We’ve been eager to safe harbour as much as we can, as I think everyone has across the industry. We’ve actually taken advantage of both ways to begin construction—both the 5% method and physical works.”

Ryan Pfaff, executive vice president at EDF Renewables, confirmed: “Most of the larger companies have safe harboured. There will be some pain moving forward; some companies don’t have the cash to safe harbour, so they are already facing significant challenges.”

As Stacy J. Ettinger, vice president of supply chain and trade at the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), and others maintained: “the industry will continue to grow out of necessity.”

Trivedi declared: “We are bullish on renewables. Of our US$13 billion additional capex, it is heavily geared towards batteries and solar. There is so much power demand coming at us that we need to meet quickly.”

John Smirnow, principal at Smirnow Law, advocated presenting US solar manufacturing as “a national security imperative.” Lawrence-Vaca shared a similar sentiment, saying: “the game is to keep the lights on”, and the low levelised cost of electricity (LCOE) and scalability of solar mean it remains an attractive technology.

Strong demand and community solar

Despite facing significant challenges from the OBBB, the US solar industry continues to thrive, driven by strong demand from data centres and electrification.

Although the OBBB has introduced new hurdles compared to the IRA framework, industry leaders are finding ways to adapt through safe harbour strategies, supply chain enhancements and coalition building. There is widespread agreement that solar will keep growing, thanks to its cost benefits and rapid deployment capabilities, even as tax incentives eventually come to an end.

In the last few weeks, a number of states have seen increased appetite for small-scale solar in particular, as a way to meet electricity demand and give local communities a degree of control over the power projects being built in their areas.

In California, the California Solar and Storage Association (CALSSA) has proposed fines for utilities for delaying the community solar approval process, while Wisconsin Republicans have introduced a bill to grant local groups more power over approvals for community solar projects.

Arevon Energy CEO Kevin Smith noted the importance of building relationships within communities, noting: “Community engagement activities are critical right now. Communities speak on your behalf, and the volatility that comes from not using renewables won’t reflect well on the administration.”",https://www.pv-tech.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/pvt.jpg,N,,2025-09-16 12:04:50.237170

The incentives apply to everything from heat pumps to solar panels, electric vehicles, and home weatherization.

These incentives help reduce energy costs and greenhouse gas emissions, thereby protecting the climate. The recently passed “Big Beautiful Bill” legislation moved up the deadlines for these tax incentives, so it is important to act on them now.

Electric vehicles

For individuals and homeowners, the new and used electric vehicle tax incentives expire September 30, 2025. You must purchase the electric vehicle by that deadline to qualify for the tax credits. See qualified new models and regulations for a tax credit up to $7500. See qualified used models and regulations for a tax credit up to $4000. Tax credits of up to $1000 are available for electric vehicle chargers as well, with a deadline for installation by June 2026. Check out the details here.

Electric vehicles are cheaper to run and have lower maintenance costs than gasoline-powered vehicles. Plugging in saves money and the hassle of gassing up your vehicle, and electric vehicles are great performers on the road. Charging your electric vehicle in Alameda reduces greenhouse gas emissions compared to gasoline-powered vehicles, as Alameda Municipal Power provides 100% renewable energy electricity.

Home energy

Save on your home energy costs and earn a tax credit of up to $3200 with energy-efficient home improvements by December 31, 2025. Qualifying actions include installing insulation, sealing doors and windows, installing a heat pump HVAC or a heat pump water heater, and performing energy audits. You can receive 30% of the total cost for these energy improvements with various regulations applied.

Lastly, you can receive a residential clean energy credit of 30% of the system cost for installing renewable energy, including solar, wind turbines, geothermal heat pumps, and home batteries. There is no cap on the value of 30% of the system cost. You can carry forward the balance of any tax credit to the following year, if you don’t have enough tax liability to use the full credit in one year. See additional details.

Local businesses, nonprofits, schools, and local governments have later deadlines for these clean energy tax incentives, but they have been moved up as well. So check them out and start planning now.

Gavin Newsom’s (D) desk.

The package’s six bills — some of which passed with bipartisan support in an extended session on Saturday — marked a last-minute victory for Newsom, who negotiated the final terms of the legislation with State Senate and Assembly leaders over the past week.

“We have agreed to historic reforms that will save money on your electric bills, stabilize gas supply, and slash toxic air pollution — all while fast-tracking California’s transition to a clean, green job-creating economy,” the governor said in a statement in the days leading up to the package’s passage.

Within the package is a bill to increase the amount of climate credit appearing on utility bills, as well as another that would revive California’s ability to expand regional power markets via U.S. West clean energy. A third bill focused on improving utility wildfire safety by strengthening oversight and expanding a dedicated fund for wildfire readiness.

The package also included an extension of the state’s cap-and-trade program, now to be known as “cap-and-invest.” This system, which sets emissions caps and distributes tradable credits within that framework, seeks to hold carbon polluters accountable by charging them for excessive emissions.

Established by Republican Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger in 2006, the program was set to expire in 2030 but would now be reauthorized until 2045, if signed into law.

The fifth bill in the package centered on strengthening local air pollution reduction efforts and oversight by extending monitoring periods, redoubling the efforts of state and local air quality agencies to deploy effective strategies.

A final piece of legislation, which received pushback from some progressive lawmakers, involved the stabilization of both in-state petroleum production and refinery supply, while also offering protections to communities located near wells.

The Center for Biological Diversity slammed the passage of this bill, arguing that it was included “as a last minute ‘gut and amend’ measure at the end of the legislative session.”

The bill, the organization warned, exempts oil drilling in California’s Kern County from state environmental quality requirements for the next decade, allowing for the approval of up to 20,000 new wells.

“It’s senseless and horrifying that California just gave its seal of approval to this reckless ‘drill, baby, drill’ bill,” Hollin Kretzmann, an attorney for the center, said in a statement.

Other environmental groups, however, voiced their support for the suite of climate-related bills, with the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) commending the state for maintaining “its climate leadership.”

NRDC staff members particularly praised the advancement of the cap-and-invest extension, as well as western grid regionalization and the wildfire protections.

“While the Trump administration takes us backward, California will continue to address climate change, while improving affordability,” Victoria Rome, California government affairs director for the NRDC, said in a statement. “Our lives and prosperity depend on it.”

In addition to the six-bill energy package, Newsom will also be receiving a selection of unrelated climate bills that received the legislature’s approval.

Pilot Company has opened electric vehicle charging sites at more than 200 of its travel centers across almost 40 states, according to an announcement last week.

Recent openings include Pilot’s first EV charging stations in Colorado, South Carolina, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Dakota, South Dakota and Wyoming.

This puts the program, which is being developed through a collaboration with General Motors and charging infrastructure company EVgo, nearly halfway to its goal of 500 locations and 2,000 charging stalls.

Dive Insight:

Pilot is building many of its chargers in rural areas because fewer than half of rural counties had any public EV charging infrastructure, the company noted in its announcement. These could not only be a resource for customers in more remote areas, but can also encourage stops from road-trippers with electric vehicles.

Pilot travel centers are typically located along interstates, which carry more than 20% of total traffic in the U.S., according to the announcement. Its travel centers, which offer on-site restaurants and free WiFi in addition to their 350 kilowatt fast chargers, give customers plenty to do while their cars charge. They also feature Plug & Charge payments for compatible EVs.

“Our collaboration with General Motors and EVgo continues to bring highway-based charging to more routes where this critical infrastructure is needed to enable coast-to-coast EV travel,” said Shannon Sturgil, senior vice president of alternative fuels at Pilot.

To date, Pilot has received $15 million in funding help from the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure program. While the Trump Administration has made some changes to the NEVI program, that funding could still help Pilot, GM and EVgo build more sites.

Pilot said it expects to reach 1,000 stalls in 40 states by the end of this year.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/ZPCIDg7BrSXJx5DNH8a_kPcqsp4gCe4k64Z1FAlMcro/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9JTUdfOTY4Ni5KUEc=.webp,N,,2025-09-16 11:01:18.239660

ATLANTA — It seems like a terrible time to build an electric vehicle plant in the United States, but Rivian Automotive leaders say they’re confident as the company starts long-delayed work on a $5 billion facility in Georgia.

The money-losing California-based company breaks ground Sept. 16 east of Atlanta despite President Donald Trump’s successful push to roll back electric vehicle tax credits. Starting Sept. 30, buyers will no longer qualify for savings of up to $7,500 per car.

Rivian Chief Policy Officer Alan Hoffman said the company believes it can sell electric vehicles not for environmental or tax incentive reasons, but because they’re superior.

“We did not build this company based upon federal tax incentives,” Hoffman said. “And we’re going to prove that we’re going to be successful in the future.”

The Georgia plant, first announced in 2021, is Rivian’s key to reaching profitability. Now the company makes the high-end R1T pickup truck and the R1S sport utility vehicle in Normal, Ill., as well as delivery vans for Amazon and others. Its truck prices start at $71,000.

The Illinois plant will begin making smaller R2 SUVs next year, with prices starting at $45,000. An expanded Illinois plant will be able to assemble 215,000 vehicles yearly. But if the R2 is a hit, and if Rivian successfully produces an even smaller R3, it will need more capacity. The company has said the Georgia operation will be able to make 200,000 vehicles yearly starting in 2028. It plans another 200,000 in capacity in phase two, volume that would spread fixed costs over many more vehicles.

The projections would be a big leap from the 40,000 to 46,000 vehicles Rivian expects to deliver this year, down from 52,000 last year. The company says it’s limiting production now in part to launch 2026 models.

“For Rivian, it’s do-or-die time,” said Alex Oyler, North American director of auto research firm SBD Automotive. “We saw with Tesla that the key to profitability is scale, and you can’t scale if your cheapest vehicle is $70,000. So they need that plant online to achieve a level of scale of R2 and ultimately R3.”

Sales growth is slowing for electric vehicles in the United States, rising only 1.5% in 2025’s first half, according to Cox Automotive.

Tesla accounted for almost 45% of U.S. electric vehicle sales in that period, according to Cox. But the giant is losing market share as others gain: General Motors’ slice of American EV sales has climbed to 13%. By comparison, Rivian had a 3% share in the first half of the year, behind Tesla and six traditional automakers.

But excluding Tesla, Rivian is the most successful of the startup automakers.

The company initially tapped a largely unfilled niche: demand for electric pickups and SUVs. But the competition now includes Ford’s F-150 Lightning and the electric Chevrolet Silverado.

After an initial public offering in 2021, Rivian shares have fallen by more than 80%, while automaker shares overall have outpaced the broader stock market. Rivian lost $1.66 billion in 2025’s first half.

At the same time, some automakers’ ardor for electric vehicles is cooling. Stellantis last week canceled Ram’s electric truck program. Ford has delayed production at a new Tennessee plant. And General Motors abandoned plans to build electric vehicles at a suburban Detroit plant.

“With all the competition out there in this market and the slowing growth of EVs, it does not play in Rivian’s favor,” said Sam Fiorani, a vice president at AutoForecast Solutions. “However, there still is an EV market out there.”

Georgia has pledged $1.5 billion of incentives to Rivian in exchange for 7,500 company jobs paying at least $56,000 a year on average. Rivian can’t benefit from most incentives unless it meets employment goals, but the state is already spending $175 million to buy and grade land and improve roads.

Georgia Republican Gov. Brian Kemp, who has said he wants to make Georgia “the electric mobility capital of America,” acknowledges Rivian faces bumps, but says he remains confident the company can fulfill its promises.

While Tesla has thousands of employees in California and Texas, some new electric vehicle plants have sputtered. Two separate EV makers that hoped to assemble vehicles in a former GM plant in Lordstown, Ohio, went bankrupt. Georgia’s Hyundai complex near Savannah is faring better, with production underway. However, a battery plant there has been delayed by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement arresting 475 people on site, including more than 300 South Koreans.

Rivian was supposed to be making trucks by now at the 2,000-acre site near Social Circle, about 45 miles east of Atlanta. As the company burned through cash in 2024, it paused construction. But German automaker Volkswagen agreed to invest $5.8 billion in Rivian in exchange for software and electrical technology. And then-President Joe Biden’s administration in November agreed to loan Rivian $6.6 billion to build the Georgia plant.

Despite the Trump administration’s hostility toward EVs, Hoffman said Rivian hopes the U.S. Department of Energy will distribute the loan money, arguing it will boost domestic manufacturing.

Rivian also faces opposition from some residents who say the plant is an inappropriate neighbor to farms and will pollute the groundwater.

“I planned on dying and retiring on the front porch and the biggest project in Georgia has to go next door to me, of all places in the country?” asked Eddie Clay, who lives less than a mile away. He says his well water turned mud-choked after excavation at the Rivian site.

There are other challenges for Rivian, including tariffs costing $2,000 per vehicle, the Trump administration ending a tax-credit program that will cost the company $140 million in revenue this year, and long-term threats from low-priced, cutting-edge Chinese EVs. But Hoffman says Rivian is “in this for the long haul.”

“We think that we can compete with anyone out there and that once given the opportunity, we’re going to excel,” he said.

Designed to expand rural electrification, the NNNF offers concessional finance and subsidies to off-grid solar companies, enabling them to reduce costs to consumers and make home solar systems more affordable.
Moreover, around 10% of the new home solar systems are being used to generate income and operate small businesses.
In 2022, we also removed taxes on off-grid solar products, services, and equipment, to reduce costs and make solar more accessible to low-income households.
Crucially, off-grid solar technologies are delivering power to communities that were left behind by traditional infrastructure.","LILONGWE – Like many African countries, Malawi faces significant energy-access challenges. In 2024, just 26% of the population had regular access to electricity – 11.3% via the grid and 14.6% through off-grid systems. With a population that is predominantly rural and widely dispersed, grid extension is costly, slow, and often unfeasible. Making matters worse, recent global economic shocks have further constrained investment in large-scale infrastructure.

Thus, for millions of Malawians, life after sunset has long unfolded in near-total darkness. Children struggle to study, businesses shut down early, and community life grinds to a halt. Rural households have had no choice but to rely on candles, kerosene, or battery-powered torches – costly, polluting stopgaps that undermine health, education, and economic opportunity.

But the outlook has brightened thanks to advances in distributed renewable energy (DRE) technologies – including solar-powered lanterns, solar home systems, and mini-grids – which can be deployed quickly, scaled flexibly, and priced more in line with household-income levels.

As realistic, sustainable, and inclusive solutions to the energy-access problem, DREs are powering economic growth by enabling small businesses to operate after dark, creating jobs in the clean-energy sector, and unlocking opportunities across education, health care, agriculture, and other sectors.

To leverage the opportunities implied by off-grid solar, the Malawian government has launched a suite of new initiatives and programs. A good example is the flagship Ngwee Ngwee Ngwee Fund (NNNF), launched in 2023 with $20 million from the World Bank through the Malawi Electricity Access Project. Designed to expand rural electrification, the NNNF offers concessional finance and subsidies to off-grid solar companies, enabling them to reduce costs to consumers and make home solar systems more affordable.

By focusing on small Tier-1 systems, this approach has successfully expanded electricity access in Malawi, already surpassing the original target of 250,000 households by June 2025. Moreover, around 10% of the new home solar systems are being used to generate income and operate small businesses.

The NNNF’s success has led to a rapid increase in private-sector investment. For example, local and women-led companies like Zuwa or Yellow offer pay-as-you-go solar power systems that align with rural income patterns and support unbanked customers, while SolarAid Malawi supplies electricity through its energy-as-a-service approach. Thanks to these efforts, the country aims to reach 1.55 million off-grid connections by 2030.

To complement this ambition, new energy cooperatives are rolling out mini-grids in high-demand areas. These cooperatives will also help to keep the focus on productive uses of electricity (such as oil expelling, welding, and bakeries) and provide power for farming needs such as irrigation and processing.

Through our Mission 300 Energy Compact, Malawi aims to achieve 70% national electricity access by the end of the decade, setting an example for others across the Global South. The NNNF has shown that public finance can unlock private-sector delivery, helping solar companies to reach rural households quickly and affordably.

But subsidies are just one lever. In 2022, we also removed taxes on off-grid solar products, services, and equipment, to reduce costs and make solar more accessible to low-income households. NNNF subsidies have helped, but the consistent, predictable tax and policy frameworks that support them have been no less important.

Now, we are looking beyond access to explore how off-grid solutions can also serve broader development goals. The economic logic is clear. Energy access allows Malawians to work and study after dark, run small businesses, irrigate farms, store food, and access mobile money. These activities raise incomes, deepen markets, and ultimately expand the country’s tax base.

Proactive, responsible fiscal policies can not only promote energy access but also drive rural development and economic growth. Off-grid energy is breathing new life into local economies, with the sector itself creating thousands of jobs. Solar companies are training and hiring sales agents, technicians, installers, customer service teams, and community representatives. These jobs often replace informal work or subsistence farming, offering skills, steady incomes, and long-term career paths. Many of these jobs go to women and young people, fostering greater inclusion and stronger community leadership.

Beyond creating jobs, reliable energy access enables new livelihoods – powering everything from barbershops and radio stations to farms and restaurants. Malawi is proving that clean energy and economic growth can go hand in hand, opening doors for the next generation.

Crucially, off-grid solar technologies are delivering power to communities that were left behind by traditional infrastructure. These are no longer niche, untested solutions. They are a central part of our integrated energy-access strategy. By combining public commitments, private innovation, and integrated planning, we are building energy systems that reflect today’s rural and urban realities.

The momentum behind these technologies is growing globally, with initiatives like Mission 300 signaling stronger international political will. But we must not become complacent. Clean energy is not a luxury. It is the foundation for modern life, and millions are still waiting for access.",https://webapi.project-syndicate.org/library/651640067eb659413bbdf1f95a9db3e8.2-1-super.1.jpg,N,,2025-09-16 17:03:04.999164

FEOC thresholds are 55% for projects beginning in construction in 2026 and go up to 75% for projects starting after 2029.
This Safe Harbour status is thought to apply to a significant capacity of supply deals signed by Chinese players.
Following industry announcements throughout this year, it seems Chinese companies are also chasing non-US markets like Europe and the Middle East harder than ever before, perhaps to de-risk exposure to US policy, including FEOC and import tariffs.","Under the new foreign entity of concern (FEOC) rules, US downstream projects or upstream manufacturing cannot benefit from material assistance from prohibited foreign entities (PFEs) above certain thresholds, if they want to receive tax credit support.

China is among the countries on a list that includes Russia, Iran and North Korea. The latter three are already largely cut off from accessing the US market.

More pertinently, China’s dominant position of involvement in almost every aspect of the supply chain bar software—from which it is already prohibited—means the question of what happens next realistically only applies to China.

At this year’s RE+ solar PV, BESS and EV trade show last week in Las Vegas, ESN Premium was briefed behind the scenes by representatives of Chinese companies and discussed the situation further with analysts and developers.

In Energy-Storage.news’ coverage of the show last week, we reported on the emphasis on domestically made products for the US market, evident from US-headquartered companies like Fluence and South Korean players like Samsung SDI. This time out, we ask: what’s next for China’s incumbent suppliers?

The Chinese company representatives we spoke to preferred to do so on condition of not being named or directly quoted for this article, as this would require a longer lead time to clear from their head offices.

FEOC ‘will definitely have a big impact on energy storage’

“Storage can keep tax credits until 2033 at the full rate, although there are some caveats around new restrictions on the prohibited foreign entities, namely around material assistance from Chinese companies or working with China,” Isshu Kikuma, energy storage analyst at BloombergNEF (BNEF), told ESN Premium.

The restrictions on material assistance from PFEs apply to everything from materials to finished products, investment and even service agreements for operations and maintenance (O&M). That makes it a big challenge for the industry, Kikuma said.

“Basically, three-quarters of the import value of lithium-ion batteries in the US comes from China. Having that restriction for projects starting after 2025, when it comes to the construction year, will definitely have a big impact on energy storage,” Kikuma added.

FEOC thresholds are 55% for projects beginning in construction in 2026 and go up to 75% for projects starting after 2029.

It is important how ‘in-construction’ rules are defined. They refer to the date when either physical work began or 5% of capex spend was incurred. Again, solar and wind lost this 5% rule, whereas storage and other technologies retain it, explained BNEF policy expert Derrick Flakoll.

“The FEOC rule is obviously still an issue, but if you can begin construction on your project before the end of this year, you don’t have to worry about that,” Flakoll said.

Safe Harbour represents immediate opportunity

In other words, projects in the pipeline that are already advanced enough can carry on as before. This Safe Harbour status is thought to apply to a significant capacity of supply deals signed by Chinese players.

A member of US-based senior management from one Chinese vertically integrated BESS technology provider told ESN Premium that it has signed contracts on Safe Harboured projects for completion over the next two to three years, totalling around 10GWh.

Flakoll said that rules still need some final clarification from the Trump administration, but in all, the OBBBA’s final passing into law will likely spur activity for projects that can begin construction as soon as possible.

Kikuma said that, based on the law’s language, the US will be a “difficult market” for Chinese players going forward, but Safe Harbour represents a significant potential “last-minute opportunity.”

Players talk up chances of overcoming ‘very difficult’ situation

Another representative of a Chinese company ESN Premium spoke to, which is involved in system integration but not battery cell manufacturing, said that while it had yet to secure a definitive roadmap to compliance with non-FEOC rules, “there was no doubt” that it would do so.

Perhaps the cell and non-cell question is pertinent: lithium cells still comprise the most significant part of a BESS project’s Capex. Therefore, compliance with some Chinese equipment may be possible, but compliance using all-Chinese-made cells is challenging.

Following industry announcements throughout this year, it seems Chinese companies are also chasing non-US markets like Europe and the Middle East harder than ever before, perhaps to de-risk exposure to US policy, including FEOC and import tariffs.

Nonetheless, the companies we speak with appear determined to meet eligibility criteria somehow, even if those plans themselves are not fully formed.

When asked if corporate restructuring on the part of Chinese players could help them achieve this goal, BNEF’s Derrick Flajkoll said it is a “very difficult situation for them to figure out.”

“In terms of corporate structure and debt, there’s a series of very complicated, overlapping tests that mean you would have to go through a very tough obstacle course to be compliant and claim tax credits,” Flakoll said.

“You would have to reduce Chinese ownership share, which includes not just the share from the government, but the share from any Chinese citizens who are not also US permanent residents or citizens. You also have to make sure your debt is structured properly so you haven’t issued 15% or more of it to Chinese citizens or entities.

“That said, theoretically speaking, you could perhaps arrive at a certain small enough collective Chinese ownership share that a joint venture (JV) would qualify. However, it’s then on a facility-by-facility level, and is fairly likely to get hit by prohibitions either related to supply chains or related to intellectual property, EPC and other service contracts.”

It would take what the policy analyst called a “very thorough scrub” to be compliant, while compliance for the 45X manufacturing tax credit is determined yearly, based on when a component is sold.

“It is theoretically possible that they could go from non-compliance to compliance, or vice versa, but keep in mind, we have a fairly short window on these remaining tax credits. They start phasing out in the early 2030s and by that point, that’s only a little bit of your amortisation of your factory that’s going to cover,” Flakoll said.

“So, it’s a difficult situation for them to figure out. I have no doubt that some of them are trying, but it’s tough, and you can imagine why some of them might be looking to sell to other players for that reason.”

One workaround beyond Safe Harbour that a Chinese company we spoke to was considering is the establishment of manufacturing facilities outside China, such as in Southeast Asia or the US itself.

ITC: Not the only game in town?

There are reasons why China’s position in the battery storage supply is so dominant.

Chief among them is that China can deliver much cheaper products, partly through technology innovation and largely through the sheer scale of manufacturing that its companies have often achieved.

Indeed, our contact at the vertically integrated Chinese BESS manufacturer tells us that it hopes to sell products into the US for projects that don’t have any ITC strings attached.

This may be especially true for large projects like data centres, which have an economic imperative to come online quickly and, therefore, have less cost-sensitive developers.

Kikuma said his team at BNEF are currently checking this, although he has some doubts.

“If their products are cheap enough, maybe their projects don’t need investment tax credits to be economically cost-competitive, so possibly there might be opportunities for non-ITC projects,” he said.

Kikuma said going the non-ITC route sounds like a disadvantage. Still, his colleague Flakoll added that there may be a “wedge” of projects in the market that turn to unsubsidised Chinese supply chains, rather than as a mainstream option.

“Isshu did some modelling, and basically the projected US storage build in 2035 can be almost, but not quite, met by production from Southeast Asia to South Korea and the US combined. There’s a little wedge there that needs to be filled by somebody, and the Chinese manufacturers have the expertise,” he said.

“The costs are going to keep declining. They have the scale. They’re locked in fairly deadly competition with each other that none of them wants to lose. They want access to a valuable market like the US.”",https://www.energy-storage.news/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_7050.jpg,N,,2025-09-16 11:01:02.807801

This groundbreaking project positions the North African kingdom at the heart of the global clean energy race, transforming Morocco into a key supplier of batteries for electric vehicles and renewable energy storage systems.

The facility, strategically located in Kenitra, northwest Morocco, represents far more than an industrial investment – it’s a testament to Morocco’s emergence as a critical bridge between continents in the fast-evolving green economy. With China’s African investments reaching unprecedented levels and Morocco’s automotive sector already topping $15.7 billion in exports, this partnership arrives at a pivotal moment for both nations and the continent as a whole.

Strategic Location Drives Industrial Transformation

The timing of this investment reflects Morocco’s calculated positioning in global supply chains. Located just 14 kilometres from Spain, Morocco provides a natural gateway to European markets, where demand for electric vehicle batteries is surging ahead of the EU’s 2035 ban on new fossil fuel vehicles.

According to Khalid Qalam, Gotion’s Moroccan director, construction will begin imminently, with earthworks already completed and production scheduled to commence in the third quarter of 2026. The facility’s initial capacity of 20 gigawatt-hours (GWh) annually will be sufficient to power hundreds of thousands of electric vehicles, with plans to scale operations to an impressive 100 GWh over time.

This vertical integration approach sets the project apart from typical assembly operations. Unlike many plants that rely on imported components, the Kenitra facility will produce critical electrode materials including cathodes and anodes. This comprehensive manufacturing capability reduces Morocco’s dependence on foreign supply chains while strengthening regional supply security, providing a competitive advantage that few other regions can match.

Morocco’s Automotive Success Story Provides Foundation

The battery gigafactory builds upon Morocco’s remarkable automotive sector transformation. The kingdom’s automotive industry has maintained its position as the country’s leading export sector, with overseas sales rising 6.3% to MAD 157.6 billion ($15.7 billion) in 2024. This achievement represents Morocco’s emergence as Africa’s leading automotive exporter, surpassing traditional powerhouses including China, Japan, and India as the EU’s top automotive supplier.

Morocco’s vehicle production reached 535,825 units by the end of 2023, with nearly 80% destined for export markets. Major manufacturers including Renault and Stellantis have established significant operations in the kingdom, creating an established industrial ecosystem that provides the ideal foundation for battery manufacturing expansion.

The automotive sector’s success demonstrates Morocco’s ability to integrate into global supply chains while developing local industrial capabilities. Passenger cars now represent 14.9% of Morocco’s total exports, followed closely by automotive parts and components at 3.7%, establishing a comprehensive automotive value chain that the battery project will significantly enhance.

China’s Evolving African Investment Strategy

The Morocco battery project exemplifies China’s evolving approach to African investment, shifting from traditional infrastructure projects toward high-tech manufacturing and clean energy initiatives. Chinese FDI in Sub-Saharan Africa reached an all-time high of $15.2 billion in 2024, representing 16.5% of newly announced investments.

This investment wave reflects China’s strategic positioning in Africa’s energy transition. Between 2010 and 2021, Chinese financial institutions provided approximately $18 billion annually in global energy lending, with nearly one-third directed to African economies. The Morocco project represents a significant evolution from earlier coal and hydropower investments toward renewable energy and battery technology.

Gotion High-Tech is not operating in isolation. Other Chinese companies including BTR, CNGR, Hailiang, and Shinzoom are simultaneously investing heavily in Morocco’s battery materials sector, creating a comprehensive ecosystem for green technology manufacturing. This coordinated investment approach positions Morocco as North Africa’s definitive hub for clean energy manufacturing.

Economic Impact and Job Creation

The economic implications of the gigafactory extend far beyond its impressive $5.6 billion price tag. The first phase alone involves $1.3 billion in investment and is projected to create 17,000 jobs directly and indirectly. As the project expands through its five planned development phases, total employment could reach 10,000 direct positions, with thousands more indirect opportunities across the supply chain.

Initial operations will create 2,300 jobs immediately, while the facility will serve European automakers and Morocco’s domestic automotive hubs. The project will also target energy storage markets in Africa and the Middle East, regions ideally suited for renewable energy development with approximately 300 days of sunshine annually.

For Morocco, this represents a strategic opportunity to diversify beyond traditional industries like agriculture and textiles, moving decisively into high-tech manufacturing. The vertical integration approach – producing both batteries and their critical components – positions Morocco as a comprehensive supplier rather than merely an assembly location.

Continental and Global Implications

The Morocco-China partnership carries significance extending far beyond national boundaries. By anchoring Africa’s first battery gigafactory, Morocco is establishing a precedent for how the continent can transition from primarily supplying raw materials to becoming a value-added manufacturer in the clean energy economy.

Africa’s mineral wealth includes substantial deposits of copper, lithium, cobalt, manganese, and rare earth metals – all essential ingredients for electric vehicle batteries and renewable technologies. If the Morocco model is replicated in countries like the Democratic Republic of Congo (cobalt), Zambia (copper), and Zimbabwe (lithium), the continent could capture significantly greater value from its natural resources.

The project also addresses Africa’s massive energy access challenge, with 600 million people – roughly 43% of the continent’s population – still lacking reliable electricity access. Battery manufacturing capabilities could support renewable energy storage solutions across the continent, accelerating electrification efforts.

Market Positioning and Export Strategy

Approximately 85% of the gigafactory’s output will be exported to the European Union, providing the bloc with a strategic alternative to Asian supply routes that have traditionally dominated battery manufacturing. This positioning offers Europe enhanced supply chain security while supporting its ambitious decarbonization targets.

The facility will leverage Morocco’s existing trade relationships and geographic advantages. Morocco’s proximity to Europe, established logistics infrastructure, and preferential trade agreements create an ideal export platform. The kingdom’s demonstrated ability to integrate with European supply chains, evidenced by its automotive sector success, provides confidence in the battery project’s commercial viability.

Beyond Europe, the facility will target Africa’s emerging electric vehicle market, where Chinese EV manufacturers are rapidly expanding operations. Electric car sales in Africa more than doubled in 2024, reaching approximately 11,000 units, though they still represent less than 1% of the continent’s total vehicle market, indicating substantial growth potential.

Sustainability and Environmental Considerations

The gigafactory project aligns with broader environmental objectives across multiple dimensions. Morocco’s commitment to renewable energy development provides a sustainable power source for battery manufacturing, while the facility’s output will support global electrification efforts and carbon emissions reduction.

The project addresses China’s commitment to cleaner overseas investments, following President Xi Jinping’s 2021 pledge to cease funding new coal-fired power plants overseas. The battery project represents the type of clean technology investment that characterizes China’s evolved approach to African development cooperation.

Morocco’s abundant renewable energy potential – with substantial solar and wind resources – positions the battery manufacturing facility to operate with minimal carbon footprint. This sustainable approach could establish a template for similar projects across the continent, demonstrating how industrial development can align with environmental objectives.

Challenges and Risk Considerations

While the project offers substantial opportunities, it also presents challenges requiring careful management. Some experts express concerns about potential debt dependencies and the concentration of Chinese influence in critical industries. Morocco’s government will need to ensure that the partnership delivers genuine technology transfer and local capacity building rather than merely creating assembly operations.

The project’s success will depend on Morocco’s ability to develop local technical expertise and supplier networks. Building a sustainable industrial ecosystem requires more than foreign investment – it demands educational institution development, skills training programs, and policies that encourage local participation in emerging industries.

Market volatility in the global battery sector poses another consideration. While demand projections remain strong, technological developments, raw material price fluctuations, and shifting government policies could impact project economics. Morocco’s diversified approach – targeting multiple markets and applications – helps mitigate these risks.

Future Implications and Expansion Potential

The Morocco battery gigafactory represents the beginning rather than the culmination of Africa’s clean energy manufacturing transformation. Success in Morocco could inspire similar projects across the continent, particularly in countries with abundant mineral resources and favorable investment climates.

The project’s vertical integration model – producing both batteries and critical components – could be replicated and expanded. Future developments might include lithium processing facilities, cathode material production, and battery recycling capabilities, creating a comprehensive clean energy manufacturing ecosystem.

Regional integration through initiatives like the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) could further enhance the project’s impact. Imagine vehicles assembled in Morocco using components manufactured across Africa and exported tariff-free continent-wide. Such integration would reduce costs, build intra-African trade, and decrease reliance on volatile overseas markets.

Looking Ahead: A New Model for African Development

As the world accelerates toward cleaner energy and transport systems, Morocco’s battery gigafactory may well become a blueprint for African nations determined to transform natural resource wealth into sustainable, long-term prosperity. The project demonstrates how strategic international partnerships can create jobs, facilitate technology transfer, and secure stronger positions in global industries of the future.

The success of this initiative could inspire a new development model across Africa, where countries move beyond commodity exports toward value-added manufacturing. With proper execution, Morocco’s gigafactory could mark the beginning of Africa’s emergence as a major player in the global clean energy economy, offering a path toward sustainable industrialization that benefits both the continent and its international partners.

For Morocco, the project represents both economic opportunity and geopolitical positioning. By aligning with China while strengthening ties with the European Union, the kingdom is establishing itself as a bridge between Africa, Asia, and Europe in the rapidly growing green economy. This strategic positioning could prove transformative for Morocco’s long-term economic development and regional influence.

The gigafactory’s impact will extend far beyond battery production, potentially catalyzing broader industrial development and positioning Morocco as Africa’s clean energy manufacturing hub. As construction advances and production begins, the project will serve as a crucial test case for similar initiatives across the continent, offering lessons and insights for Africa’s clean energy future.

Tesla’s revenue declined for the second consecutive quarter, according to its July 23 Q2 earnings report.

Its shares were down 16% in the first week of September 2025, the worst performance among megacap stocks.

The federal EV tax credit is set to expire on Sept. 30.

The looming expiration date of federal electric vehicle (EV) tax credits has shaken up the EV market, and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA), the leading American EV manufacturer, may be the most impacted. Its shares have dropped 45% in 2025, reaching a calendar-year low of $214 in April.

And even though share prices bounced back in recent days/weeks/months, they are still down for the year, with Tesla CEO Elon Musk isn't very optimistic about the short-term outlook.

Tesla has another rough earnings report

In its July 23 Q2 earnings report, Tesla posted a 16% decline in quarterly sales for the second straight quarter. The automaker also saw year-over-year declines in both revenue and vehicle deliveries.

Musk stated back in July that the company could have a few ""rough quarters,"" highlighting tariff-related cost increases and the expiration of the tax credit as contributing factors. The company plans to limit vehicle inventory for Q3, and is uncertain whether it will be able to guarantee delivery for orders placed after August.

Musk, who was an advisor to President Donald Trump until May, when he resigned, stated in April that he believes lower tariff rates are beneficial for ""prosperity."" While Tesla is a U.S. manufacturer, it imports various car parts from multiple foreign countries that are currently impacted by tariffs, including battery cells from China.

The end of the EV tax credit

First introduced in 2009, the federal EV tax credits were implemented as incentives for U.S. consumers to purchase electric vehicles. The current credit for a new EV purchase is $7,500, while used car purchases can receive $4,000.

However, now that Congress has passed President Trump's ""big, beautiful bill,"" those credit incentives will expire on Sept. 30. Consumers who have their car delivered after Sept. 30 will still receive the credit, provided the purchase occurs before the deadline.

In 2024, the U.S. Department of the Treasury and IRS reported that the government spent more than $2 billion in federal tax credits for more than 300,000 electric vehicle purchases. There's a strong chance that consumers will capitalize on the expiring credits, causing EV sales to spike briefly in September and then drop.

A study published in the National Bureau of Economic Research in October 2024 predicts that if the credits are eliminated, EV sales in the U.S. will fall by nearly 30%.

Tesla's share price increased in August

The EV company's stock price climbed 9% in August, marking a second consecutive month of price increases. But it has a lot of catching up to do, as share prices are currently down by 16% in 2025 in the first week of September. It's been over eight months since Tesla stock reached an all-time high, peaking at $488 on Dec. 2, 2024.

Competitors such as Ford Motor Company and General Motors will also be impacted by the tax credit elimination, but have their gas vehicle production to fall back on. Ford's share price was up by 18% in 2025, as of early September, while GM's increased 17%.

Is Tesla stock a buy right now?

While Tesla stock has been trending upward in recent months, macroeconomic factors like ongoing tariff disputes and a presidential administration that is actively rolling back EV initiatives make the stock a potentially volatile investment.

Once investors understand how Tesla plans to manage production after tax credits expire, they'll be able to make a more informed decision about the stock's long-term value within their portfolio. And there's a strong chance the stock will bounce back once President Trump is out of office. But for now, investors should wait for the next earnings report before purchasing shares.

“This is a rare opportunity to invest in needed new energy resources while harnessing homegrown resources that are by far the most cost effective right now,” Wright said in a statement.","Before clean energy tax credits expire under congressional Republicans’ “big, beautiful” law, clean energy advocates are requesting the Utah Public Service Commission to direct PacifiCorp, the parent company of Utah’s largest electricity supplier, to open an expedited procurement process for wind, solar and storage resources.

The process, Utah Clean Energy says, has the potential to save Utahns millions, or even billions of dollars in future energy costs.

“The question isn’t if Utah invests in new energy resources, we know we need to bring on new energy. The real question is how much those investments will cost,” Sarah Wright, CEO of Utah Clean Energy said in a statement. “This is a once in a decade opportunity to procure zero-fuel-cost renewable projects at record low prices.”

According to the filing, with the passage of the federal spending package, there’s a tight window for PacifiCorp to develop new energy resources with federal tax credits, which would result in substantial cost savings for state ratepayers.

Utah Clean Energy analysts calculated that PacifiCorp’s preferred resource portfolio could save ratepayers 56.8% for solar resources and 55.7% for wind over 25 or 30 years, the estimated lifetime of the assets, if it takes advantage of tax credits.

“In dollars, this amounts to over $150 million of savings for every 100 MW of solar built and over $210 million of savings for every 100 MW of wind built,” the request reads.

The spending package, in addition to new U.S. Treasury Department guidance for clean energy projects eligible for the tax incentives, have created new restrictions and shorter timelines for projects pursuing tax credits. But, developers can still access clean energy production tax credits.

PacifiCorp’s preferred portfolio would have “3181 MW of tax-advantaged solar and 2641 MW of tax-advantaged wind that will reach commercial operation by the early 2030s,” the filing says. The company is planning to start a procurement process in the next four years to reach that deadline.

But, those plans were made before the updated federal legislation, so if the company wants to capture the tax credits, it needs to push the accelerator.

“This is a rare opportunity to invest in needed new energy resources while harnessing homegrown resources that are by far the most cost effective right now,” Wright said in a statement. “These ultra-affordable resources will contribute to Governor Cox’s Operation Gigawatt goal of doubling energy generation over the next 10 years while ensuring Utahns have reliable, affordable clean energy for decades to come.”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-47642/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/012925_wind-energy_08-1024x6831758024477.jpg?h=199d8c1f&itok=XbTKNRg3,N,,2025-09-16 16:01:44.973746

Bloomberg News

(TNS)

The Trump administration has been slashing green energy incentives, freezing the construction of wind farms and ordering coal-burning power plants to keep running longer than planned. And yet, more American homes and businesses are getting their power from renewable sources than ever before — and in greater amounts.

In June, almost one-quarter of U.S. power generation was green, up from 18% in the year-earlier period, according to data compiled from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The question now is whether the trend continues with President Donald Trump back in the White House.

The recent growth in renewables usage is almost certainly tied to investments made prior to Trump’s election in November. Under former President Joe Biden, the U.S. backed roughly $100 billion of investments in clean energy. Now, the Trump administration is taking a sledgehammer to those efforts by opposing offshore wind farms and eliminating incentives for electric vehicles and solar power.

Still, Texas is a prime example of how the energy markets have changed. In early March, the state’s grid set a record for wind generation; in mid-June, it registered a new peak for electricity produced from renewable resources; and a month later, Texas notched new highs for battery storage and solar generation.

Similar records are popping up across the country on an almost weekly basis, as utilities harvest a windfall from new solar and wind farms that can be built faster and more affordably than fossil fuel-based power plants.

Here are five charts that capture a bit of the size and scope of America’s recent wave of green energy, showing where and how it’s happening, and what the landscape looks like going forward.

Nearly one-third

For utilities and folks operating the nation’s power grids, the wave of green energy couldn’t come at a better time because volatile weather, electric vehicles and a rash of AI-focused data centers are all driving up demand.

In April, as grid operators were girding for heat waves, nearly one-third of U.S. power was generated from renewable sources. And the green energy boom is spreading beyond the Sun and Wind belts. The New York grid hit a renewable record on June 24. New England recorded new highs for both wind and solar power this summer and the grid in the Mid-Atlantic states reported a record renewable harvest in late June.

“We’re in an entirely new landscape for load growth, so this is none too soon,” said Forest Bradley-Wright, state and utility policy director at the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy. “Every solution available will need to be called on.”

What good is the dawn?

If all of the utility-owned solar panels in California were considered one facility, it would have ranked at the end of July as the second-largest power plant in the world. At noon on July 30, solar generation on the state’s CAISO grid hit 21.7 megawatts, second only to the capacity of the Three Gorges Dam on China’s Yangtze River.

For much of that day, the sun accounted for roughly two-thirds of the power Californians were using and the panels fed into batteries that, once the sun went down, juiced nearly one-third of the state.

Charge baby charge

The Texas power market is truly the Wild West of electricity.

As a deregulated, wholesale market, the state’s consumers can choose their provider and plants are only paid for what they produce. In this eat-what-you-kill energy world, utilities have turned en masse to a novel tool: big batteries.

These so-called storage facilities let power players sock away electrons when demand (read: prices) are low and discharge the juice when usage peaks. Often, the most economical strategy is storing solar power during the day and releasing it in the evening when the lights and TVs switch on and air conditioners are still humming.

A rash of new storage facilities have been switched on in Texas this year, shoring up the grid with record amounts of reserve power.

A mighty wind

In Wyoming, the largest coal-producing state in the U.S., it’s common for tractor trailers to get blown over onto their sides. Such is the power of the wind on the Great Plains. And it’s steady as well as strong.

On the Southwest Power Pool grid, which stretches from the Dakotas south to Texas, new records for wind power were reached twice in August alone. At one point on Aug. 16, almost two of every three electrons in the system were coming from turbines.

Clicking the boxes

Good, cheap or fast? Typically, one only gets to choose two of those things. But now, solar, wind and other renewable sources are clicking all three of those boxes when it comes to producing electricity. So-called green energy is currently the lowest-cost and quickest-to-deploy power generator in the U.S., even without incentives, according to research from Lazard Inc.

Given President Donald Trump’s attacks on green power, the decisions made by utilities have become more fraught than usual and a bit more complicated than just choosing the cheapest plant to build. In May, Gordon van Welie, chief executive officer of the ISO New England grid, told the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission that his organization was counting on large quantities of offshore wind to meet rising demand. Three months later, the Trump administration ordered crews to stop working on a project off the coast of Rhode Island where 45 of 65 planned turbines have already been installed, a directive that it now has to defend in court.

The facility was expected to power roughly 350,000 homes. Administration officials say solar and wind is unreliable and too connected to China-based supply chains. Trump’s term, however, will likely be over long before any new coal-fired or nuclear plant can be built to replace that capacity.

“We need more electrons in this country and the industry seems to have an agnostic view,” said Lazard Managing Director Samuel Scroggins, referring to where electrons originate. “Practically speaking, renewable energy is ready to build and it remains below the cost of alternatives.”

In its Taking Stock 2025 analysis released this week, Rhodium warned that the U.S. is on course for “much slower emissions reductions than previously anticipated” as the White House and Congress roll back policies that underpinned the rapid expansion of solar, wind, and EV adoption over the past decade.

Hostile Climate Policy Shift

Since returning to office in January, President Donald Trump has advanced what analysts describe as one of the most abrupt reversals in U.S. energy and climate policy in recent history.

His administration has scrapped incentives for clean energy projects, moved to accelerate fossil fuel development, and targeted the 2009 “endangerment finding”, a landmark Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) ruling that established greenhouse gases as harmful to public health and provided the legal basis for climate regulations.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin has formally proposed rescinding the endangerment finding, calling it a step toward “commonsense policies that expand access to affordable, reliable, secure energy.”

Energy Secretary Chris Wright praised the move as a way to strengthen fossil fuel and nuclear power generation, in sharp contrast to the previous Biden administration’s prioritisation of renewable technologies.

“The first seven months of the second Trump administration and 119th Congress have seen the most abrupt shift in energy and climate policy in recent memory,” Rhodium Group noted.

Decarbonization Pace Slows

Rhodium’s projections show the U.S. could reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 26–41% by 2040 relative to 2005 levels. That is far below the 38–56% cut the firm estimated in last year’s report. The slowdown is particularly stark in its “high emissions scenario,” where average annual reductions would collapse to just 0.4% between 2025 and 2040—less than half the rate achieved in the past two decades.

At the heart of the reversal is the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” (OBBBA), a sweeping budget reconciliation measure passed by Congress earlier this year. Rhodium estimates the law will cut the build-out of new clean power-generating capacity by 53–59% over the next decade, effectively putting at risk more than $500 billion in clean energy and transportation investment.

“It also places nearly $150 billion of existing clean energy manufacturing investment under pressure,” the group said, warning of reduced domestic demand for solar panels, wind turbines, and EV components.

Solar Industry at Risk

The solar industry faces a particularly uncertain future. While developers are racing to complete projects before remaining tax incentives expire in 2027, longer-term prospects have dimmed due to new restrictions on permitting and penalties tied to Chinese supply chains.

A joint report by the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) and Wood Mackenzie forecasts the U.S. could lose 44 gigawatts (GW) of planned solar deployment by 2030—a decline of about 18%.

“Instead of unleashing this American economic engine, the Trump administration is deliberately stifling investment, raising energy costs for families and businesses, and jeopardising grid reliability,” said SEIA president and CEO Abigail Ross Hopper.

Michelle Davis, head of solar research at Wood Mackenzie, added that “federal policy uncertainty is making the business environment incredibly challenging,” with developers cautious about committing new capital.

Notably, the industry’s growth has been concentrated in Republican-led states. SEIA data show that 77% of solar capacity installed this year has been built in Trump-won states such as Texas, Indiana, Arizona, and Florida.

Wind Power Stalls

Wind energy is also showing signs of strain. Although installations rose earlier this year, turbine orders plunged by 50% in the first half of 2025, reaching their lowest point since 2020, according to a report by Wood Mackenzie and the American Clean Power Association (ACP).

ACP data show the U.S. clean power development pipeline has stagnated, with solar installations falling 23% and new power purchase agreements nearly grinding to a halt.

“The uncertainty created by new bureaucratic delays and unclear demands is chilling the pipeline for future projects,” ACP CEO Jason Grumet said. “This is stalling growth precisely when the nation needs more energy to power a growing economy.”

Broader Implications

The policy U-turn not only undermines U.S. climate commitments but also threatens jobs and industrial investments tied to the energy transition. Clean power and EV supply chains had been a cornerstone of federal and state-level industrial policy in recent years, with billions of dollars flowing into domestic manufacturing hubs.

Now, analysts warn, those investments could dry up, ceding ground to Europe and Asia, where governments continue to incentivize renewables and clean technologies.

The Rhodium report underscores that executive decisions will further shape how deeply the OBBBA curtails clean energy momentum. If the administration aggressively enforces new trade and permitting rules, the hit to investment could exceed its current half-trillion-dollar estimate.

The Bottom Line

What emerges is a sharp divergence between the U.S. and its major trading partners. While the European Union has upheld “green” designations for nuclear and natural gas to support its clean energy transition, Washington is signaling a retreat from renewables in favor of fossil fuels.

For now, the U.S. remains on a path to slower emissions reductions, weaker renewable growth, and a less certain investment climate. As Rhodium put it bluntly: “The U.S. is no longer driving decarbonization at the pace required to meet its climate commitments. The policy environment has turned openly hostile to wind, solar, and electric vehicles, with consequences that will reverberate for decades.”",https://cdn.businessday.ng/2022/03/clean-energy.jpg,N,,2025-09-16 12:04:12.495270

By 2023, almost a quarter of all the energy we consumed came from renewable sources – double the share in 2010, when it sat at 12.5%. Building on this progress and to keep the momentum, in 2023, EU countries set the binding target of achieving a share of at least 42.5% renewables in the energy mix by 2030.

Harnessing the energy of abundant renewable sources like the wind, the sun and our rivers offers a sustainable and crucial alternative to burning fossil fuels – allowing us to produce our own clean, secure and affordable energy in Europe. In 2024, almost half of our electricity needs could be covered from renewables. As we decarbonise our economy, the electrification rate needs to pick up significantly, and so will demand for storage solutions.

While renewable energy sources can’t be depleted in the same way as fossil fuels, they are ‘variable’, meaning their availability fluctuates. It is therefore important that we invest in technologies that help address this. That’s where energy storage solutions, such as batteries, have a vital role to play. Technological developments and market uptake have already had a positive impact on the storage sector: the costs of battery storage are down by 93% since 2010, according to theInternational Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA).

Hydropower: a leading storage solution

Pumped storage hydropower is the largest energy storage technology globally. It works by pumping water into reservoirs when there is an electricity surplus in the grid, for example on a sunny or windy day, and releasing it to generate electricity when more energy is needed.

46 GW capacity of pumped storage hydropower is installed in the EU, amounting to almost a quarter of the total global installed capacity.

Furthermore, from 2019 to 2021, EU companies were responsible for 29% of high value hydropower inventions globally.

The world’s growing demand for batteries

Although your smartphone, power bank or kitchen clock is likely to spring to mind when you think of batteries, you may be surprised to learn that consumer electronics made up only 2% of global battery deployment distribution in 2023. Meanwhile, mobility applications (such as electric vehicle batteries) and stationary energy storage systems accounted for 86% and 12% respectively. This paints a clear picture of the effect that the energy transition and electrification are having on driving global battery demand.

According to the International Energy Agency, the average global demand in the energy sector, for both electric vehicle (EV) batteries and storage applications, for a single week in 2024 exceeded the total demand for an entire year just a decade earlier. In this context, the sector reached the historical milestone of 1 TWh in battery demand in 2024.

Here in the EU, according to the quarterly report on European electricity markets, more than 620 000 new electric vehicles (EVs) were sold in the passenger car segment in the first 3 months of 2025. This marks a record high for the first quarter of any year and is 15% higher than the same quarter last year, translating into a 21% EV share in the EU passenger car market.

Securing the EU’s battery supply

The global battery sector is intensely competitive. According to the 2025 report from the Commission’s Clean Energy Technology Observatory, in 2023, the EU accounted for 8% of the global Li-ion battery production capacity, contributing an estimated 90 000 direct jobs to the EU economy, up from 61 000 in 2022. This being said, the EU still relies on imports to meet 50% of its demand, with approximately 83% of global Li-ion battery production capacity situated in China in 2023.

In this respect, the EU is determined to close the gap with China and the United States and assert itself as a global leader in this key industry.

As part of these efforts, in July 2025, the Commission announced a total of €852 million in strategic investments in 6 pioneering EV battery cell manufacturing projects, in the form of grants from the Innovation Fund. This followed the Commission’s 2023 announcement to strengthen the EU's battery manufacturing capacity by allocating up to €3 billion in targeted support to incentivise investment in domestic EV battery cell manufacturing capacity to reduce reliance on foreign suppliers.

The EU’s Batteries Regulation, which entered into force 2 years ago, helps ensure that Europe’s ambition on batteries does not come at an environmental cost. It contributes to the EU’s circular economy and zero pollution ambitions and strengthens our strategic autonomy on batteries.

Novel energy storage solutions

Beyond batteries and pumped storage hydropower, the EU ranks second, after the U.S., in the number of companies developing novel energy storage technologies and leads in liquid air energy storage.

From 2019 to 2021, the EU submitted 277 invention claims, with 54% considered high value, while China submitted 5 000 claims, of which 3% were high value. Nonetheless, both regions exhibit similar levels of high value inventions.

A lack of reliable data represents a challenge in analysing emerging energy storage markets. The Commission’s European Energy Storage Inventory can help address this gap within Europe. Launched in March 2025, it is the first European-level tool of its kind, providing a real-time dashboard of energy storage levels in Europe, offering energy storage data across a full range of technologies. Why not navigate the interactive map and find out where your nearest energy storage project is located?

Under its objectives, the company will drive clean energy deployment across the whole of the UK, as a developer, investor, and owner of clean energy projects – working in tandem with the private sector, devolved governments, local authorities and community energy groups.

Throughout this, the company will be required to put working people and communities at the heart of the clean energy transition – by increasing public ownership and community involvement in the development of clean energy projects, and supporting jobs and economic growth across the UK.

The government has also now set a target for Great British Energy to start making returns on its commercial activities as a whole by 2030. This includes a requirement for the company to have a plan for becoming self-financing in place by 2030, with profits reinvested into clean energy projects that will help protect billpayers permanently.

The strategic priorities – agreed by all devolved governments – set a clear vision for how Great British Energy will provide a catalyst for the expansion of the UK’s homegrown, clean energy supply. It follows the passing of the Great British Energy Act in May.

Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said:

It is time to make things and own things in Britain again. That’s why we have set up Great British Energy to be a new national champion and allow us to reap the benefits of Britain’s abundant natural resources.

Great British Energy will place working people, communities and British industries at its core, turbocharging clean energy across the country as part of our clean power mission.

The government has today confirmed the 3 key areas that the company should focus on to meet these objectives:

investment in and development of nascent and more established technologies and assets required for Clean Power 2030 and beyond

activity in domestic supply chains to build long-term domestic resilience and economic growth

supporting the growth of local and community energy, working alongside government to deliver a Local Power Plan that will help to ensure local people and communities benefit from the clean energy transition

Great British Energy will produce a strategic plan within 6 months, setting out how it will meet the Energy Secretary’s expectations to support the clean power mission and deliver for the British public.

Great British Energy’s CEO, Dan McGrail said:

Work is already underway at Great British Energy to deliver our Strategic Plan, and we welcome the Secretary of State’s recommendations. Most of the clean energy projects in the government’s’ Industrial Strategy will flow through Great British Energy, enabling us to be the green growth engine for the UK.

We are going to invest £1 billion in domestic supply chains, which I expect will unlock billions more in investment and create thousands of jobs. Along with our partners like The National Wealth Fund, The Crown Estate, Great British Energy-Nuclear and many more, we are primed to develop innovative ways to grow new renewable technologies, ensuring our energy is engineered in the UK.

The company will also continue to work closely with the National Wealth Fund and build on key partnerships made over the last year, to support the development of clean energy projects – including with The Crown Estate and Crown Estate Scotland. This has already seen Great British Energy and the government join forces with The Crown Estate and industry to invest £1 billion in offshore wind supply chains, supporting economic growth and skilled well-paid jobs across UK.

Notes to editors

The Great British Energy Act 2025 set a requirement for the government to publish a Statement of Strategic Priorities for Great British Energy within 6 months.

In March, Great British Energy awarded £180 million to fund rooftop solar panels at schools and NHS sites, set to deliver savings of up to £400 million over 30 years.

In July, Great British Energy awarded mayoral authorities across England a share of £10 million in grant funding to roll out clean energy projects for community buildings, including care homes, leisure centres and libraries. The schemes are estimated to produce £35 million of lifetime savings on energy bills, money which can be reinvested in vital services.

The devolved governments are receiving separate funding over £9.3 million from Great British Energy for public sector or community renewable energy schemes.",https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/68c9537907d9e92bc5517b7b/s960_125_GBE_Statement_960_post_v1.1.jpg,N,,2025-09-16 12:04:24.362316

Its shares have dropped 45% in 2025, reaching a calendar-year low of $214 in April.

And even though share prices bounced back in recent days/weeks/months, they are still down for the year, with Tesla CEO Elon Musk isn't very optimistic about the short-term outlook.

Tesla has another rough earnings report

In its July 23 Q2 earnings report, Tesla posted a 16% decline in quarterly sales for the second straight quarter. The automaker also saw year-over-year declines in both revenue and vehicle deliveries.

Musk stated back in July that the company could have a few ""rough quarters,"" highlighting tariff-related cost increases and the expiration of the tax credit as contributing factors. The company plans to limit vehicle inventory for Q3, and is uncertain whether it will be able to guarantee delivery for orders placed after August.

Musk, who was an advisor to President Donald Trump until May, when he resigned, stated in April that he believes lower tariff rates are beneficial for ""prosperity."" While Tesla is a U.S. manufacturer, it imports various car parts from multiple foreign countries that are currently impacted by tariffs, including battery cells from China.

The end of the EV tax credit

First introduced in 2009, the federal EV tax credits were implemented as incentives for U.S. consumers to purchase electric vehicles. The current credit for a new EV purchase is $7,500, while used car purchases can receive $4,000.

However, now that Congress has passed President Trump's ""big, beautiful bill,"" those credit incentives will expire on Sept. 30. Consumers who have their car delivered after Sept. 30 will still receive the credit, provided the purchase occurs before the deadline.

In 2024, the U.S. Department of the Treasury and IRS reported that the government spent more than $2 billion in federal tax credits for more than 300,000 electric vehicle purchases. There's a strong chance that consumers will capitalize on the expiring credits, causing EV sales to spike briefly in September and then drop.

A study published in the National Bureau of Economic Research in October 2024 predicts that if the credits are eliminated, EV sales in the U.S. will fall by nearly 30%.

Tesla's share price increased in August

The EV company's stock price climbed 9% in August, marking a second consecutive month of price increases. But it has a lot of catching up to do, as share prices are currently down by 16% in 2025 in the first week of September. It's been over eight months since Tesla stock reached an all-time high, peaking at $488 on Dec. 2, 2024.

Competitors such as Ford Motor Company and General Motors will also be impacted by the tax credit elimination, but have their gas vehicle production to fall back on. Ford's share price was up by 18% in 2025, as of early September, while GM's increased 17%.

Is Tesla stock a buy right now?

While Tesla stock has been trending upward in recent months, macroeconomic factors like ongoing tariff disputes and a presidential administration that is actively rolling back EV initiatives make the stock a potentially volatile investment.

Once investors understand how Tesla plans to manage production after tax credits expire, they'll be able to make a more informed decision about the stock's long-term value within their portfolio. And there's a strong chance the stock will bounce back once President Trump is out of office. But for now, investors should wait for the next earnings report before purchasing shares.",https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/833639/evs.jpg,N,,2025-09-16 11:00:32.697783

ABB announced today that it will invest a further $110 million in the United States in 2025 to expand the R&D and manufacturing of its advanced electrification solutions as customers focus on improving energy efficiency and uptime while reducing their energy costs. The IEA estimate US wholesale electricity prices rose by 30-40% in the first half of 2025, compared with 2024.

Creating nearly 200 new jobs, the investment will support expected future growth in key industries, including data centers and the power grid. Rapid expansion of data centers in the US is expected to keep annual electricity demand growth above 2% in both 2025 and 2026, more than double the average growth rate over the past decade (IEA).

A new production line will be created in Mississippi for ABB’s innovative Emax 3 circuit breakers, an advanced technology used to protect critical infrastructure, such as data centers.

“This $110 million investment in the US is part of our long-term strategy to support future growth in our biggest global market,” said Morten Wierod, ABB’s Chief Executive Officer. “Demand is being driven by key trends, from the surging power needs of AI in data centers, to grid modernization and customers improving energy efficiency and uptime to reduce their costs. Our investments will ensure we can meet growing demand from customers across North America in line with our local-for-local strategy.”

Manufacturing new technology

ABB will invest $15 million to create a new production line for Emax 3 in its Senatobia, Mississippi site. The cutting-edge Emax 3 air circuit breaker improves the energy security and resilience of power systems in large facilities with high power demands, including data centers, advanced manufacturing sites, and airports. The new line is expected to open in 2026.

A $30 million project will double the footprint of ABB’s Richmond, Virginia facility adding a new test center, warehouse and new assembly lines. The power quality and protection products made in Richmond are used by data centers, manufacturing plants and utilities to protect critical systems in essential operations and services, like servers, MRI machines and production lines from electrical failures. The new facility, opening in Q4 2025, will create around 100 new production and engineering roles.

In Arecibo, Puerto Rico, an investment of more than $30 million will increase the size of the facility to accommodate three new production lines. Made for industrial and commercial operations in the US, technologies produced in Arecibo include smart circuit breakers and switching devices, essential power components that help distribute electricity, protect equipment and monitor energy usage. The expansion will create 90 new skilled jobs by the end of 2026.

A $35 million investment will increase the capacity of ABB’s manufacturing facility in Pinetops, North Carolina. This will support expected demand for advanced low and medium voltage grid components from the utilities, and for data centers and industrial facilities. The expansion will support customers upgrading their energy infrastructure with advanced sensors and new switching and grid protection devices. The upgraded facility will open in 2026.

And it wasn’t a welcome surprise, industry insiders and experts say.

“I think we maintained some hope that they wouldn’t go this far because we had advocated to the EPA that they shouldn’t do that,” said one industry lobbyist granted anonymity to discuss the proposed rule freely.

EPA’s proposal would relieve major emitters in most industrial sectors from the duty to report annual emissions above a certain threshold. The reporting program, which has existed since 2009, feeds into EPA’s comprehensive greenhouse gas inventory.

The agency was widely expected to leave the oil and gas industry out of the proposal. Greenhouse gas reporting for oil and gas producers, processors and operators — which falls under the program’s “Subpart W” — is mandated under the 2022 climate law.

The oil and gas industry has sought modifications to the Biden-era rules for that reporting, but no major trade associations have asked EPA to end it. The Trump EPA was expected to propose different —and likely more industry-friendly — reporting methodologies for oil and gas next summer.

Instead, EPA unexpectedly proposed shelving annual emissions reporting for oil and gas until 2034.

The agency is claiming that a provision in the Republican megalaw that suspended a related fee on methane emissions until 2034 also empowers the administration to mothball emissions reporting until the same year. That assertion is controversial and likely to be litigated if the rule is finalized in its current form.

Oil and gas experts say that the loss of EPA’s reporting program could present problems — especially for companies hoping to sell their gas in the European Union.

EU complications

Starting in January 2027, E.U. gas importers will have to prove the supply they sell on the European market meets the bloc’s standards for monitoring, reporting and verification of methane leakage. Companies can show compliance with those standards at the corporate level, or exporting nations can secure an “equivalence determination” that covers all their producers.

The E.U. has never agreed to deem that all U.S. producers meet that “equivalency” threshold, even during the Biden era when the sector was covered by methane regulations and a fee on excess methane leakage.

The Biden administration tried to negotiate that, noted Fred Hutchison, president and CEO of LNG Allies, which promotes U.S. gas exports.

“They didn’t say yes, didn’t say no — it was right around the time of the election, and I think they wanted to see where the leaves fell off the trees,” he said. But with the greenhouse gas reporting program, along with state regulations, industry practices and outside certification programs, “it was sort of judged that you could patch together a reasonable case on country level equivalency.”

Now, those Biden-era methane controls are either gone or in the process of being rolled back. Meanwhile, the E.U. and authorities in its member states who will implement the new methane limits have been vague about their criteria for determining national “equivalence” or corporate compliance with the standards. Those policies may not be filled in until next year, and U.S. gas exporters — who supply about 45 percent of E.U.’s liquefied natural gas imports — are staring down possible restrictions beginning in 16 months’ time.

EPA’s proposal to stop reporting and data collection for oil and gas emissions can only make that more likely, experts say, because companies expected to be able to use that emissions database to demonstrate compliance.

“This completely shoots a hole in anyone who would be advocating for there to be equivalent before the Europeans,” said the oil and gas lobbyist.

To prove compliance with the E.U. policy, a company’s emissions data must be verified by a qualified third party. The loss of EPA’s database would likely prompt industry to look for certification elsewhere, experts said, not only to access European and other global markets, but to attract climate-conscious purchasers within the United States.

Bob Stout, senior adviser to the Natural Gas Innovation Network, said the industry could partner with energy experts in academia to create a high-quality voluntary database.

“If we don’t have a mandatory framework like Subpart W here, having those different credible and trusted stakeholders come together to say, ‘OK, here are the data. Here’s how we’re accounting for it,’ is going to be critical for its credibility internationally,” he said. “It’s in our interest even from a pure energy standpoint, setting aside the climate change concerns. We want a credible accounting system so that we can demonstrate the emissions characteristics of the gas that we’re selling around the world.”

Getting ahead of the curve

The E.U. methane requirements are set to take effect in the midst of a broader upheaval in global trade wrought by Trump’s tariff policies. Energy Secretary Chris Wright and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum spent last week in Europe pressing the European Commission and member countries to loosen methane regulations to ease the flow of U.S. gas onto the market.

“In this environment, where there’s further definition to be made regarding those rules, the U.S. government is pressuring various individual countries and the E.U. to relax or scrap them,” said Christopher Goncalves, chair of the energy and climate practice at consulting firm BRG.

“I just note — or observe — the synchronicity between this decision about the Subpart W data and the effort to get the Europeans to relax the requirements,” he added. “It’s sort of like saying, ‘We’re not going to be collecting this data anymore, and you shouldn’t be either.’”

Hutchison of LNG Allies said the only workable solution for U.S. producers and exporters would be for the E.U. to substantially amend its methane legislation.

“They simply did not take account of the complexity of our system and the enormous co-mingling and practical intraceability of our pathways,” he said.

E.U. gas importers are primarily responsible for demonstrating compliance with the standards, and they don’t produce the gas and may not have good information about its methane intensity.

Ben Cahill, an analyst at the University of Texas, Austin, said that was a complicating factor, and industry is seeking clarity from the European Commission and national-level authorities about how the standards would be implemented. But he said the the restrictions are unlikely to simply go away.

“It’s a law,” he said. “I mean, it’s legislation that’s been passed in the European Union. So, the question is: How can it be implemented in a practical way, so that it’s actually achievable for the industry to do what the European Commission wants? And I still believe it’s possible, but it’s going to require some clarity and simplification.”

EPA said last week that doing away with the greenhouse gas reporting rule would save the oil and gas industry $2.4 billion in compliance costs.

But Goncalves of BRG said removing the regulatory requirement wouldn’t prevent many oil and gas companies from devoting resources to finding and fixing leaks and tracking their emissions.

“Companies have been eager to get ahead of the curve to comply with European requirements, anticipate Asian requirements, and pursue [environmental, social and governance] and other things that the administration doesn’t like, but they’ve done it for a variety of reasons having to do with long-term thinking,” he said.

“They might stop doing it, but I think the people who have already committed and developed it as a commercial differentiator and corporate differentiator are likely to continue doing that,” he said.",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/76/a6/01bbb87949fc8338a40de1f1d04a/texas-daily-life-45343.jpg,N,,2025-09-16 08:58:46.663119

The following month, OPEC announced it would increase production at a time when oil prices were already at a four-year low, taking industry analysts by surprise.
Oil prices would spike tremendously.
And while they did surge, they came right back down.” Trump’s tariffs haven’t helped the U.S. fossil fuel industry either.
“There is some expectation that oil prices could be lower for an extended period of time.”","When President Donald Trump took office, he promised to “unleash American energy” — and quickly left no doubt that he meant fossil fuel energy in particular.

In the months since, he has opened up vast stretches of public lands and U.S. oceans for drilling and reduced the royalty rates that companies must pay for extracting oil and gas in those areas. His administration has also proposed scrapping environmental rules requiring polluters to report their emissions to the EPA, easing regulations for oil and gas wastewater disposal, and rewriting rules to weaken risk management protocols at refineries. And by declaring a national energy emergency, Trump has cleared the way for faster permitting primarily for fossil fuel infrastructure, bringing down review timelines from multiple years to a few weeks. Trump’s signature legislation, the One Big Beautiful Act, quietly included billions of dollars in new federal tax breaks available to fossil fuel companies. More substantially, it dramatically scaled back federal support for wind and solar energy, as well as electric vehicles — effectively dealing a blow to the newer technologies competing with oil and gas interests.

But the boom times Trump has promised U.S. fossil fuel producers have not materialized. In fact, the industry is headed in the opposite direction: In recent months, Chevron said it would cut as much as one-fifth of its workforce, ConocoPhillips announced plans to let go of up to a quarter of its workforce by the end of the year, and Halliburton began its own round of layoffs. Across the sector, companies have also been reining in spending, cutting capital expenditures, pausing or cancelling major projects, and reducing rig counts.

“We believe we are at a tipping point for U.S. oil production at current commodity prices,” warned Travis Stice, CEO of Diamondback Energy, a Texas-based oil and gas company, in May. “Today’s prices, volatility, and macroeconomic uncertainty have put [the industry’s] progress in jeopardy.”

Since Trump’s inauguration in January, crude oil prices have dropped nearly 20 percent. That’s left prices below the roughly $65-per-barrel level where most U.S. producers can expect to break even on drilling, and they’re cutting back in anticipation of these unprofitable extraction conditions lasting into 2026. Indeed, the Energy Information Agency projects that oil prices, which currently sit at about $62 per barrel, will drop to $51 per barrel next year.

This reflects the makeup of the global oil market, which President Trump has far less control over compared to the domestic regulations he’s attacked. In Saudi Arabia, for instance, where drilling costs are among the lowest in the world, a barrel of oil costs at most $10 to extract. So when the global price of oil drops, as it has this year, American producers feel the squeeze — but national oil companies in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, or OPEC, continue to be profitable.

So even though President Trump has called for more drilling to lower domestic gasoline prices, American companies see little reason to pump more oil when prices are below the break-even point. The result reveals a paradox in the administration’s pursuit of what it calls “energy dominance”: It wants both lower prices and more drilling, but the former automatically discourages the latter.

“The goal of energy dominance is perhaps not fully aligned with the goal of low oil prices without significant innovation,” said Susan Bell, a senior vice president at Rystad Energy, an independent research firm, in an emailed statement. “Increasing U.S. production in a world that is oversupplied with oil in the near term would certainly drive prices down, ultimately making investment in the sector uneconomic.”

That disconnect has been on full display this year. Even as Trump promised boom times for the oil and gas industry, he has called on OPEC to increase production as a means to fulfill his promise to lower gasoline prices for Americans. In a January speech, he told OPEC to “bring down the oil price,” and in March he said that it was “very important that OPEC increase the flow of oil” in a social media post on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter.

The following month, OPEC announced it would increase production at a time when oil prices were already at a four-year low, taking industry analysts by surprise. While the move may have been an attempt to appease Trump, it was also an opportunity to assert dominance over American companies and increase the cartel’s market share. The increased production also acts as a buffer against price volatility by creating oversupply that can be tapped in times of crisis. There has been no shortage of the latter in recent years, with escalating conflict in the Middle East and the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war.

“All this extra supply creates a cushion,” said Trey Cowan, an oil and gas analyst at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, which tracks the rise of renewable energy and its impact on fossil fuels. “Events like the hunting down of people in Qatar by Israel — normally, that would be a crisis situation. Oil prices would spike tremendously. And while they did surge, they came right back down.”

Trump’s tariffs haven’t helped the U.S. fossil fuel industry either. His surcharges on steel and aluminum, two metals ubiquitously used in oil and gas infrastructure, have increased the cost of production. “The cost of our largest drilling input cost, casing, has increased over 10 percent in the last quarter due to steel tariffs,” Stice, the Diamondback Energy CEO, noted in his letter to shareholders.

Cowan said that, while oil prices rise and fall periodically, the industry is facing a highly volatile market at a time when gasoline demand is poised to take a hit from the growing adoption of electric vehicles. In its drive to find new markets, the industry invested heavily in refineries producing plastics. But there, too, the industry is now facing oversupply and slim profit margins.

India’s coal problem is not scarcity but sustainability.","India’s energy transition is among the government’s most pressing policy priorities. The country is the world’s third-largest consumer of energy, yet coal continues to dominate—accounting for 70% of electricity generation and more than half of the overall energy mix. Ambitious renewable targets have been set, but coal remains the weak link in the shift to clean power.

To address this, the government is preparing a national carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS) initiative, offering financial support of 50% to full project funding in some cases. The plan is to embed CCUS in coal-fired power generation and coal gasification projects, thereby reducing the environmental cost of continued coal use. CCUS works by capturing carbon dioxide from industrial processes or at the point of emission, and then storing it underground.

READ | Data centre future hinges on policy stability, not tax breaks

Beyond technical risk, CCUS raises concerns about how local communities will be affected. Global environmental justice literature warns that CCS/CCUS projects risk exacerbating pollution burdens in already overburdened or vulnerable regions if siting, health impact, and land use are not managed with transparency and strong safeguards. This includes needing public consultation, securing “free, prior, and informed consent”, ensuring community health monitoring, and establishing strict liability regimes in case of leaks or contamination. Without those, public trust may falter, and regulatory backlash may delay deployment.

The International Energy Agency (IEA) calls CCUS indispensable for net-zero pathways, especially in hard-to-abate sectors like cement, steel, and chemicals. For India, the technology could ease reliance on imported natural gas by supporting coal-to-gas projects. If deployed effectively, CCUS could cut gas imports nearly by half, strengthening energy security while renewables scale up.

Costs and Risks

Still, CCUS is no silver bullet. Globally, projects have faced high costs, technical obstacles, and doubts over the long-term safety of underground storage. The economics are daunting: experts estimate the cost of capturing one tonne of carbon dioxide at $40–120, depending on the sector. For coal-fired plants in India, the additional burden could raise tariffs sharply unless government subsidies cover much of the expense.

Beyond economics, storage risks loom large. Leakage could undo climate gains, damage ecosystems, and erode public trust. Without robust regulation, CCUS could add more uncertainty than relief.

India’s coal production crossed one billion tonnes for the first time in March 2025, underlining the sector’s centrality to energy security. Policymakers expect coal to remain dominant at least until 2047, when India hopes to mark its centenary as a developed nation. The real challenge, then, is not abandoning coal but using it more sustainably without compromising climate commitments.

Any CCUS deployment at scale will need far more than government grants or subsidies. According to an OECD handbook on CCUS policies and business models, successful frameworks couple policy certainty (tax incentives, carbon pricing, guaranteed off-take) with private capital mobilisation via risk-sharing mechanisms, loan guarantees, and public-private partnerships.

Reports such as “Unlocking Private Capital for Carbon Capture and Storage in Industry and Power” emphasise that projects become more bankable when cost-recovery is assured through regulated tariffs or long-term contracts—with clarity on liability, transport, storage risks, and carbon credit regimes.

Global Lessons

International experience offers both guidance and warning. Norway’s Sleipner project, launched in 1996, has successfully stored carbon dioxide beneath the North Sea, underpinned by strict monitoring and regulation. The US has expanded CCUS rapidly through the Inflation Reduction Act, which raised tax credits to $85 per tonne of stored carbon.

By contrast, Canada’s Boundary Dam project has struggled with costs and technical snags, while Australia’s pilot projects drew criticism for poor oversight and unfulfilled promises. The lesson is that success depends as much on regulatory design and institutional capacity as on technology itself.

Internationally, the trend is shifting toward CCUS hubs—clusters where capture, transport, and storage infrastructure is shared across multiple industries—which deliver cost efficiencies in scale, infrastructure, pipeline networks, and storage facilities. According to the Global CCS Institute and others, investment in CCUS is growing rapidly: in 2022, global investment almost tripled to USD 6.4 billion, with planned capacity more than doubling. For India, planning CCUS hubs in coal regions, industrial corridors or near large emitters could lower per-unit costs and foster institutional efficiencies.

India’s Path Ahead

For India, the risks are amplified by weak institutional capacity. Unlike Norway or the US, it lacks a mature framework for geological monitoring, liability transfer, and long-term regulatory oversight. Building this institutional scaffolding will be as important as building physical projects.

CCUS should therefore be seen as a transitional tool, not an excuse to expand coal indefinitely. Its value lies in buying time while renewables and green hydrogen ecosystems mature. Integrating CCUS with gasification, hydrogen production, and underground coal mining could also reduce pressure on new greenfield projects, limiting environmental disruption.

India’s coal problem is not scarcity but sustainability. With the world’s fifth-largest reserves, it cannot phase out coal overnight. CCUS offers a bridge, but only if deployed within a wider decarbonisation strategy anchored in transparency, public trust, and robust safeguards. Treated as a standalone fix, it risks becoming an expensive distraction that delays the structural transformation India urgently needs.",https://www.policycircle.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/CCUS-1.jpg,N,,2025-09-16 06:57:41.174567

The country’s total energy-related CO₂ emissions fell by 20% during this period while population grew by 14%, resulting in a 30% drop in per capita emissions.

It was reported that CO₂ emissions nationwide have primarily decreased due to a reduction in coal consumption within the electric power sector.

This decline was due to electricity generation from natural gas, which emits approximately half the CO₂ per unit of energy compared to coal, as well as from renewable sources such as wind and solar.

EIA’s ‘Short-Term Energy Outlook’ anticipates a 1% rise in US total CO₂ emissions in 2025, partly due to higher fossil-fuel use for crude oil production and electricity generation growth.

Maryland recorded the largest decline in per capita emissions, down by 49% between 2005 and 2023.

The state’s total CO₂ emissions dropped by 43% while its population grew by 11%.

Maryland also achieved the lowest per capita CO₂ emissions among states in 2023, at 7.8 tonnes, the second lowest level on record since 1960.

In the state, coal and natural gas made up 56% and 4%, respectively, for electricity generation in 2005.

By 2023, the mix had shifted to 5% coal and 41% natural gas, with new solar and wind generation contributing to a 74% cut in the state’s power sector-related CO₂ emissions.

In 2023, the transportation sector was the leading source of CO₂ emissions in almost all states along the east and west coasts of the contiguous US. These states typically have higher population densities and increased road and air travel.

Many of these coastal states have ceased using coal for electricity generation, leading to a reduction in CO₂ emissions since 2005.

In 2023, the electric power sector was the leading source of CO₂ emissions in 18 states.

Many states, including Pennsylvania, Alabama, and Wyoming, act as net electricity suppliers to neighbouring regions. A significant portion of their electricity production is derived from coal.

The industrial sector was the top emitter in four states, comprising Texas, Louisiana, and Alaska, where oil, gas, and refining dominate and in Iowa, where agriculture and biofuels contribute significantly.

Just five states accounted for more than half of all US industrial emissions in 2023.",https://www.energymonitor.ai/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/Power-EM-16-Sep-25-shutterstock_2529569749.jpg,N,,2025-09-16 06:57:53.525208

The DSGS program The DSGS program was established in the wake of its blackout and near-blackout grid events in 2020 and 2022.
The DSGS program includes one of the largest VPPs in the world, with more than 200 MW in capacity, according to the California Energy Commission.
The Brattle report also said the DSGS program could provide up to $206 million in net cost savings to all Californians.
Additionally, every dollar put into the DSGS program results in up to two dollars in customer rate reduction, according to CSSA.","California’s legislature and Gov. Newsom chose not to renew funding for its grid reliability and premier virtual power plant (VPP) program.

The decision risks ending the program altogether, according to Advanced Energy United, and may mean losing more than $200 million in energy cost savings for Californians and extending the state’s dependence on peaker plants to meet emergency power needs.

Though the Demand-Side, Grid-Support (DSGS) program is not a save-all solution, the program helps deliver reliability during heatwaves and other high-demand grid emergencies by coordinating clean distributed-energy resources, such as batteries, solar and smart thermostats. This enables utilities to use existing resources at their disposal, and in turn helps avoid resorting to building new infrastructure.

Advocates previously hoped lawmakers would enable the DSGS program to expand by boosting its funding. But the program’s funding was whittled down throughout the budget’s drafts until the boost eventually became a cut to the tune of $18 million. The DSGS program is funded through California’s Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund.

When Gov. Gavin Newsom approved the budget, he deferred decisions on most Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund investments until later in the year. Lawmakers also deferred decisions on the Distributed Electricity Backup Assets (DEBA) program, which funds new distributed batteries and microgrids.

However, after deciding not to renew the DSGS program’s funding, Advanced Energy United said the program will run out of funding by the end of the year, rendering it unable to operate in 2026.

“Cutting DSGS is a huge missed opportunity and a major step backwards on enabling a more flexible, resilient, and affordable energy future,” said Leah Rubin Shen, managing director at Advanced Energy United in a statement. “This program is a proven success in keeping the lights on while saving ratepayers money.”

“Allowing it to disappear undermines progress on affordability and discourages further clean energy investments in California,” Rubin Shen said.

Last month a coalition led by Advanced Energy United sent a letter to Newsom urging the governor to fund the program. The coalition said the DSGS program needed at least $75 million to remain operative in 2026. The coalition said the $50 million allocated to DEBA through Proposition 4 must be appropriated this year for DEBA to get off the ground.

“Defunding or delaying either program at this crucial juncture would not only undermine affordability and reliability, but also damage California’s credibility as a reliable partner for the businesses driving clean energy forward at a time when we should be leveraging their innovation and investment,” the coalition said.

The DSGS program

The DSGS program was established in the wake of its blackout and near-blackout grid events in 2020 and 2022.

California has managed to avoid similar grid emergencies since then despite rising electric demand. During the summer of 2024, the California Energy Commission said the DSDG program helped stabilize California’s grid during four separate heatwaves. The VPP part of the program was called upon 16 times during summer 2024, and its non-combustion demand-response option activated one time.

As part of California’s Strategic Reliability Reserve, the DSGS program provides incentives for residents to reduce electricity usage or to send energy to the grid during periods of high electric demand. This compensation rate is less than the cost of new incremental resource adequacy capacity costs, which have been exponentially increasing over the past several years, according to the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC).

The DSGS program leverages different resources to manage demand, offering four different enrollment options:

Option 1: Emergency Dispatch

Option 2: Market-Integrated Demand Response Incremental Capacity Pilot

Option 3: Market-Aware Storage Virtual Power Plant Pilot

Option 4: Emergency Load Flexibility Virtual Power Plant Pilot

The emergency dispatch option pays participants $2 for each kWh of incremental load reduction from their typical energy usage during DSGS dispatch events.

The DSGS program includes one of the largest VPPs in the world, with more than 200 MW in capacity, according to the California Energy Commission. Since its launch, the program has enrolled 720 MW of customer battery capacity, according to the California Solar Storage Association (CSSA).

The program’s battery VPP option could grow to 1,300 MW in the next three years if the program is funded and able to continue, according to a Brattle Group report commissioned by Sunrun and Tesla Energy, both of which are DSGS participants.

The Brattle report also said the DSGS program could provide up to $206 million in net cost savings to all Californians. Additionally, every dollar put into the DSGS program results in up to two dollars in customer rate reduction, according to CSSA.

A path forward

Edward Cazalet, CEO of TeMix and a former governor of California’s grid operator CAISO, helped show five years ago that dynamic pricing that incorporates several cost components can work on a single distribution circuit.

Cazalet, who participates in the Tesla VPP program, told pv magazine USA the VPP program would do a better job it had dynamic rates instead of its current time-of-use rates, “because then it would focus the charging at even lower prices and focus the discharging at even higher prices, particularly when the grid is stressed.”

With dynamic pricing in place, Cazalet said there’d be no benefits to the VPP programs. “What the VPP programs do is they take tax money and distribute it to customers, aggregators and VPP program monitors, and enrich them with very little benefit, if any, to the system.”

Last week, the California Public Utilities Commission ordered the state’s three major electric utilities to develop and offer to all customer classes demand flexibility rates. The order specifies that the prices must change at least hourly in response to the changing wholesale electricity cost and other factors.

The new rates are expected to reduce solar curtailment because when solar generation is high, wholesale electricity costs are lower. Customers who choose flexible rates will be able to shift some of their consumption to lower-cost hours when the sun is shining.

Even so, not all is lost for California’s VPPs.

California passed two VPP bills earlier this month that streamline how utilities use distributed energy resources (DERs) and implement VPP programs. The bills currently await Gov. Gavin Newsom’s signature.

Since lawmakers did not act on the DSGS program during this year’s session, Advanced Energy United said “the pressure is now on for the next session to produce meaningful results and close the policy gaps necessary to keep energy affordable and flexible enough to meet future needs.”

“Policymakers must act quickly in 2026 to keep DSGS alive and ensure affordable, reliable power for years to come,” Rubin Shen said.",https://pv-magazine-usa.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/47998131737_80e4e0e534_k-1200x800.jpg,N,,2025-09-16 10:06:15.681269

Europe, China and other regions are rolling out their own carbon capture incentives, creating both pressure and opportunity for US companies to lead.","Carbon capture is gaining momentum in the US as expanded tax credits and new legislation improve project economics and attract investment. A growing pipeline of projects and early industry partnerships signal potential for scale. Still, questions around permitting, policy durability and financing highlight the uncertainties that will shape how far and how fast the sector develops.

When the US Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) became law on Aug. 16, 2022, it gave carbon capture a powerful boost. The act raised the federal tax credit for projects that capture and store carbon dioxide from $50 to $85 per ton, and to $60 for CO2 used in enhanced oil recovery or industrial processes. That shift under Section 45Q of the tax code suddenly made carbon capture and storage (CCS) a much stronger business proposition.

Even before the increase, the incentive was enough to get certain projects off the ground. A North Dakota ethanol plant, Red Trail Energy, used the $50 credit to capture and store its emissions while also selling low-carbon ethanol into premium markets. But with the credit now set at $85/ton — a 70% jump — the economics have improved dramatically. Deloitte’s carbon capture specialist, Jeremy DuMuth, noted that before the IRA, fewer than half of the US projects he reviewed made financial sense. Afterward, every one of them did.

That extra support brings the credit closer to covering the real costs of capturing CO2 in tougher industries such as cement, steel and power generation. Analysts at the Clean Air Task Force have argued that the old $50 rate seriously undervalued the cost of capture, transport and storage for these sectors.

And there’s more change ahead. The newly passed One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) keeps Section 45Q in place but expands its reach, opening the door for projects that use captured carbon in oil recovery and other commercial applications.

In essence, the government is now covering such a large portion of project cost that it’s been likened to Uncle Sam financing about 30% of a project’s equity — a powerful incentive luring many new players into the game. It’s no surprise, then, that proponents describe 45Q as the “foundational market driver” for scaling up carbon management in the US. With a reliable $85/ton revenue stream locked in for 12 years per project, carbon capture has turned into a bankable business model rather than just a climate experiment.

Momentum and Investor Interest Surges

Carbon capture has been riding a wave of new investment since the IRA expanded the 45Q credit in 2022. Within a year, the US project pipeline nearly doubled — from 81 prospective facilities in late 2022 to 154 by the end of 2023, according to E&E News. Today, more than 270 carbon capture and removal projects have been announced nationwide, and over 190 of those came after the IRA’s passage. The floodgates aren’t fully open yet, but capital is pouring in as investors see real potential in turning emissions reduction into profit.

That enthusiasm spans the spectrum, from venture capital and private equity to industrial players and oil and gas majors. Tens of billions of dollars are funneling into energy transition technologies, with CCS climbing near the top of the list. Corporations are moving quickly to stake their ground in what looks like a growth sector.

Exxon Mobil, for example, created a Low Carbon Solutions division and last year bought Denbury for $4.9 billion, gaining control of the largest CO2 pipeline network along the Gulf Coast and multiple storage sites. The company described the purchase as a way to accelerate its energy transition strategy and offer CO2 transport and storage services to heavy emitters.

Partnerships are also multiplying. Midstream operators and industrial emitters are joining forces to capture and store carbon at scale. One prominent deal paired Exxon with CF Industries, a leading fertilizer producer, and EnLink Midstream to capture up to 2 million tons per year of CO2 from CF’s Louisiana ammonia plant. The CO2 will be stored in geological formations beneath Exxon’s property, with the project expected to generate about $170 million annually in tax credits at the $85/ton rate. Industry watchers say this is likely the first of many such arrangements.

Early Winners

Not all carbon capture projects are created equal. Some are advancing more quickly because their economics are stronger and the technology is ready to go. The most approachable opportunities tend to come from industries in which CO2 is easier and cheaper to capture, or where there are extra revenue streams to sweeten the deal.

Natural gas processing plants and fertilizer producers have been among the first movers, since in both sectors CO2 streams can be captured at relatively low cost. Ethanol plants have also proved attractive, thanks to their pure CO2 emissions from fermentation. Two US ethanol facilities — including Red Trail Energy in North Dakota — are already capturing and storing carbon, supported by 45Q credits and the ability to sell ethanol into low-carbon fuel markets.

Another promising model is the creation of carbon capture hubs in petrochemical and refining regions, such as the Houston Ship Channel or Louisiana’s industrial corridor. These hubs allow multiple emitters — from refineries to cement plants — to connect into shared pipelines and storage infrastructure, spreading costs and accelerating deployment.

Power generation is beginning to see movement as well. While capturing CO2 from coal and natural gas plants has long been seen as too expensive, the richer incentives are starting to close the gap. While the Petra Nova project in Texas remains the only US power-plant CCS facility in operation, it may soon have company.

Perhaps the boldest frontier is direct air capture (DAC), which removes CO2 directly from the atmosphere. Here, the IRA’s boost to $180/ton in federal credits is catalyzing projects once considered out of reach. Occidental Petroleum, for instance, has begun building a large-scale DAC facility in Texas designed to pull half a million tons of CO2 from the air each year and has announced plans for dozens more plants. Other companies — including Climeworks, CarbonCapture and Global Thermostat — are also raising capital and siting projects, encouraged by both federal support and private investment.

Taken together, these early wins show how policy incentives are creating the conditions for first movers to act. From industrial emitters to next-generation carbon removal, the projects advancing today could set the stage for carbon capture to scale at a pace once thought impossible.

Challenges and the Road Ahead

For all the optimism around carbon capture, building and operating these projects is no easy task. Each facility requires multiple moving parts — capture systems, compressors, pipelines, injection wells and long-term monitoring — which adds years to development timelines and layers of regulation.

Permitting is often the biggest bottleneck. Outside of a few states like North Dakota, Wyoming, Louisiana and West Virginia, developers must rely on the Environmental Protection Agency to approve CO2 storage wells, a process that can take years and involve tens of thousands of pages of documentation. Large multistate pipeline projects have also faced local pushback and lengthy reviews, slowing their progress.

Policy durability is another concern. The 45Q credit is only valuable if the incentive remains in place politically. While the current support is strong and bipartisan, investors remember that shifting administrations could always change course.

To ease this risk, the IRA introduced transferability and direct pay options so that companies without big tax bills can still realize the credit’s value quickly, improving cash flow. More recently, the OBBBA strengthened 45Q further, restoring full transferability and adjusting for inflation, a sign lawmakers recognize the need for stability, even as rising costs erode the credit’s buying power.

The economics, while improved, still demand heavy upfront investment. Developers often rely on government grants or low-interest loans to derisk early projects, pairing public dollars with private capital. That combination is helping to push projects forward, but scaling the industry to the level needed for climate goals will take far more. The US Department of Energy estimates that reaching net zero by 2050 could require an eighteenfold to eightyfold increase in US carbon capture capacity, hundreds of new projects beyond what exists today.

Global competition is also intensifying. Europe, China and other regions are rolling out their own carbon capture incentives, creating both pressure and opportunity for US companies to lead. With 19 commercial CCS facilities already operating and more in the pipeline than anywhere else, the US holds a head start. Keeping it will depend on sustained policy support, faster permitting and the ability to finance projects at scale.",https://energyintel.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/2fba42d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5184x2722+0+50/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fenergy-intelligence-brightspot.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com%2F31%2F62%2F66a8a6ef4db895378c752a29f71d%2Fss-2155955325.jpg,N,,2025-09-16 06:57:47.016257

After nearly three years of work, the nonprofit estimates about 70 of the state’s religious buildings have solar panels.
This Sunday, faith groups like Solar Faithful are promoting solar energy through a nationwide event called Sun Day.
During a webinar this summer, he described solar energy as an accessible and affordable source.
“If faith communities came together,” he said, “we could really see impacts in our world.” Solar Faithful’s Mulder considers faith communities a “sleeping giant” in the clean energy transition.","The connection between solar panels and his church mission wasn’t immediately obvious to Wilson Moore, deacon of New Mount Hermon Missionary Baptist Church in Detroit. But when he was tasked to install energy-efficient renovations to the church building, Moore began to see the possibilities.

As Moore met with businesses and utilities, it became clear that installing solar would allow the church to do more of what it has always wanted to do—provide aid to its community in times of need.

The southwest neighborhood copes with nearly two dozen nearby polluting industries, including a petroleum refinery and wastewater treatment plant, and congregants experience frequent home power outages, he said.

“If you have a breathing machine, you need electricity to keep going. If you have a mobilizing chair, you need electricity to charge up. Families need a place to get cool, sit down, have a meal, and be at peace while they wait for the power to come back on,” Moore said. “It dawned on me—that’s our church.”

These services could be offered, he realized, with more reliable and economical energy within the church itself, and he began working with Michigan Interfaith Power & Light and Solar Faithful, two Michigan-based nonprofits that help houses of worship adapt to climate change.

When Solar Faithful launched projects in early 2023, its leaders estimated that around 30 of the nearly 10,000 houses of worship in Michigan used solar panels. Board member Steve Mulder said the nonprofit aims to increase that to about 350, a 3.5 percent rate on par with commercial and industrial use of solar panels. After nearly three years of work, the nonprofit estimates about 70 of the state’s religious buildings have solar panels.

Such work is getting harder as federal incentives supporting clean energy diminish under the Trump administration. But advocates are pushing to keep making inroads. This Sunday, faith groups like Solar Faithful are promoting solar energy through a nationwide event called Sun Day.

Organizers have modeled Sun Day after Earth Day, which started in 1970 and quickly became an annual staple for the environmental movement. Hundreds of events will take place around the country Sept. 21, many of them led by communities of faith. Mulder’s Solar Faithful will collaborate with other nonprofits to reference the New Mount Hermon story and hear from others at an event in Kent County in western Michigan.

Actress Antonique Smith is a Sun Day spokesperson and co-founder of Climate Revival, a nonprofit that aims to mobilize communities of faith and people of color to combat climate change. Smith sees parallels in this moment and the Civil Rights Movement, which was rooted in Black churches.

“This is such a crazy time when we’re dealing with these forces and this administration that seem insurmountable,” Smith said. “We need a higher power. We need people to have faith and hope that we can win so that they would be willing to get out there and really fight.”

For Smith, pushing for solar is the same as pushing for environmental justice. “That same pollution that is causing climate change is what’s making us sick in our neighborhoods,” said Smith, who grew up in East Orange, New Jersey, near a power plant.

She said the fumes were constant and Smith believes they harmed family members, including a sister who suffers from interstitial lung disease. “Because Black and brown communities are the ones being oppressed by the pollution—they are the sacrifice zones—they should be leading the climate movement,” Smith said. “The same way Martin Luther King and those congregations led.”

Bill McKibben, the author and environmentalist, helped launch Sun Day. During a webinar this summer, he described solar energy as an accessible and affordable source.

“Solar is no longer alternative energy,” McKibben said. “It’s one of the most obvious, straightforward and commonsense sources. It’s not the Whole Foods but the Costco of energy.”

Clear Savings

The New Mount Hermon church embarked on multiple improvements, funded through federal and state grants that Michigan Interfaith Power & Light advisors helped to navigate. In February, it installed 60 solar panels at the cost of $75,000. It has also installed three furnaces for $25,000; water heaters, $21,000; LED lighting, $28,000; energy-efficient front doors, $22,000; and new freezers, $3,500.

The church’s modest one-story brick building is now saving 30 percent in monthly energy bills and training congregants to run the church as a resilience hub to help community members during power outages and extreme weather events, Moore said. Recently, seventh-grade science classes from a nearby school visited the church to hear two young women engineers explain how the panels work and share career opportunities in the solar industry.

The school visit wasn’t anything the church planned when it first considered solar, but “it turned out to be one of the best things,” Moore said.

“It was an opportunity to show kids in the inner city that there are some things you can do that don’t require you to bounce or run a ball. The skilled trades are such a viable opportunity. You always have work, and that’s something nobody can take from you.”

Faith and Climate

Nearly 90 percent of Christian leaders believe in human-caused climate change, although religious leaders “who shape the attitudes and beliefs of their congregations” rarely discuss the issue, according to a study in PNAS, a peer-reviewed journal of the National Academy of Sciences, published this March. About half have never discussed it with their congregations, and only a quarter have “mentioned it more than once or twice,” the study found.

Sun Day could be a way to change that, according to its organizers. “Sun Day represents an opportunity for faith communities to stand up and make it clear that people are concerned,” said the Rev. Fletcher Harper, founder of the international nonprofit GreenFaith, a lead partner for Sun Day.

Support for solar and wind has declined since 2020 and the drop is largely driven by partisan politics, according to ongoing Pew Research Center studies. A Pew study from 2022 found “highly religious Americans are more inclined than others to identify with or lean toward the Republican Party, and Republicans tend to be much less likely than Democrats to believe that human activity (such as burning fossil fuels) is warming the Earth or to consider climate change a serious problem.”

The study found that evangelical Christians show the least concern (34 percent) for climate change while non-Christian people of faith and Black Protestants show the most concern (72 percent and 68 percent).

But even in places like the Bible Belt, congregational interest in solar panels rises when financial incentives are offered, one nonprofit has found.

The environmental nonprofit Georgia Interfaith Power & Light (GIPL) tracked a 50 percent increase in solar installations in the state from 2023 to 2025, all related to Inflation Reduction Act incentives from the Biden administration.

The Trump administration’s withdrawal of support for clean energy is “disheartening,” said the Rev. Jay Horton, GIPL’s communications manager. Georgia residents have experienced six electricity bill hikes since 2023 with an average $43 total increase on monthly bills, and installing solar is a way to cut costs and build resilience, Horton said.

GIPL has tracked 33 completed solar installations on houses of worship in the last decade, with another seven on track to finish by the year’s end. With roughly 15,000 houses of worship in the state, the solar adoption rate is infinitesimal: 0.003 percent. Horton sees the huge gap as an opportunity.

“If faith communities came together,” he said, “we could really see impacts in our world.”

Solar Faithful’s Mulder considers faith communities a “sleeping giant” in the clean energy transition. While the Biden-era IRA was a “huge shot in the arm” for the transition, Mulder thinks it also caused people to rely on the government.

Now, he said, people are realizing, “if we want to change this, we’ve got to do it ourselves.”

Sunny Celebrations

Events celebrating solar energy on Sept. 21 will reflect faith communities’ interests and culture.

In Chicago, members of houses of worship including the Unitarian Church of Evanston and the Jewish Reconstructionist Congregation will join nonprofits, universities, justice organizations and solar installers for a Solar Fest at Montrose Beach. In Secaucus, New Jersey, members of Episcopal Church of Our Saviour will don snorkel masks, flippers and floaties to show what would happen if climate-driven sea-level rise submerged their town.

Niles Discovery Church, in the United Church of Christ denomination, in Fremont, California, will sponsor an EV car show.

Rabbi Nina Beth Cardin in Baltimore is encouraging Jewish communities to celebrate Sun Day in tandem with Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year, on Sept. 22, by assembling a special seder plate of symbolic foods celebrating hope, renewal and the light of the sun.

Climate Revival’s Smith will sing in a Sun Day Festival in New York City, featuring McKibben, journalist Kai Wright and others.

“Climate has seemed a lot like a rich white people thing,” Smith said, noting that there was a time when solar panels were out of reach for most Black communities.

“Over time what I have seen is that our communities have not been approached enough to understand their part,” Smith added. “At this point, what’s so beautiful is that because of time and technology, the prices are much lower and solar is attainable for more people. It’s for everybody.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/New-Mount-Hermon-Solar-1024x732.jpg,N,,2025-09-16 05:59:01.148123

The nonprofit has joined other environmental groups in suing the Trump administration to get the funding restored.","The Trump administration is reducing or eliminating environmental regulations and scientific funding.

Advocacy groups and some state agencies are increasing their efforts to address the resulting gap.

In North Carolina, federal cutbacks have impacted agencies like the EPA and NOAA.

With the Trump administration moving quickly to water down or even dismantle much of the country's environmental infrastructure, from regulations to financial support for science, advocates for issues ranging from clean energy and healthy living to environmental justice and habitat protection are moving to fill the void.

While these groups individually don't have the public megaphone and reach of federal agencies like the Enivronmental Protection Agency and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the hope is they can collectively keep the conversation going and step into the breach formerly filled by government-led groups and initiatives.

Still, the scale and speed of the federal government's retreat from environmental and health issues has been breathtaking. Moves by the Trump administration in North Carolina include plans to dissolve the EPA's Office of Research and Development in the Research Triangle Park near Raleigh and significant cutbacks to NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information campus in Asheville. The downsizing and financial cutbacks to the Federal Emergency Management Agency also has raised concerns about states' abilities to plan for and recover from natural disasters, including last year's Tropical Storm Helene that pounded Western North Carolina. Federal support for research at many N.C. universities, including the University of North Carolina Wilmington and Duke University, also have taken significant hits.

States run by Republicans also are moving to rein in environmental and health mandates, with Florida notably announcing in early September that it would end school vaccine requirements. In the Tar Heel State, the GOP-dominated General Assembly also has made some moves to backtrack on environmental commitments and policies championed by previous administrations in Raleigh. That includes a recent override of a veto by Gov. Josh Stein, a Democrat, that will see North Carolina retreat from aggressive carbon-reduction goals in the energy sector hashed out by former Gov. Roy Cooper, Republican lawmakers and Duke Energy back in 2021.

In response to all these changes, many groups and Democratic administrations have stepped up their environmental outreach and educational efforts − even as they deal with often substantial federal funding cuts. In North Carolina, that list includes the N.C. Department of Environmental Quality, Duke University, and the N.C. State Climate Office.

Transform understanding into action

One environmental group that has recently stepped up its outreach efforts is Charlotte-based CleanAIRE NC, which pushes for healthy communities by advocating for cleaner air and environmental justice.

The nonprofit has launched CleanAIRE Academy, an online interactive learning tool designed to help N.C. residents educate themselves about air quality and other environmental issues, something that's often invisible but can have tremendous health impacts. Topics that are covered by the self-paced seminars include the permitting process, understanding federal and state regulations, and how to effectively advocate for healthier communities.

According to the state's environmental agency, the two biggest air quality problems in North Carolina are ozone and particle pollution, with both pollutants primarily caused by vehicle emissions. Sustained exposure to a polluting source, say a factory smokestack, also can cause numerous health issues and irritate the lungs and respiratory system.

According to the American Lung Association's latest ""State of the Air"" report, North Carolina's ozone pollution isn't that bad, although Mecklenburg County is an outlier. But the state's particle pollution is a concern, with Mecklenburg and Davidson counties receiving a failing grade.

In a release, CleanAIRE said recent changes have raised questions about North Carolina's readiness to handle potential future environmental and climate challenges. Political and legal changes also have left communities and individuals short of resources and access to science and expert-driven analysis even if they wanted to advocate for change. In an example that hits close to home for CleanAIRE, the group in March lost a $500,000 EPA grant to test air quality in lower-income communities in and around Charlotte. The nonprofit has joined other environmental groups in suing the Trump administration to get the funding restored.

Rafi Vaca, the group's education manager, said while the genesis of the academy program started 18 months ago after officials saw public interest in environmental issues spike during the Covid lockdown, it has taken on a new urgency with recent actions in Washington. This summer CleanAIRE also launched the ""AirKeeper Dashboard,"" an interactive tool that displays historical and real-time air quality information for North Carolina, in response to the federal government ending much of its air quality monitoring work.

Vaca said the academy's learning modules and other programs have intentionally been made palatable and engaging to help ""demystify complex issues and inspire meaningful engagement.""

""What we're asking people to learn about can be heavy and emotive,"" she said, noting CleanAIRE is also stepping up its education and outreach efforts with its partner agencies. ""But ultimately it's important.""

“I’d say the other thing that’s different, though, is that people across the country are experiencing climate change every single day,” she said.","The “endangerment finding” is a seemingly nondescript term for what is arguably the most critical regulation in the U.S.’s climate change-fighting arsenal.

It allows the federal government, under the authority of the Clean Air Act, to regulate the greenhouse gas emissions that are warming the planet and in turn causing climate change.

The U.S. Supreme Court affirmed it almost 20 years ago.

President Donald Trump wants to get rid of it.

And that has unleashed a flood of outrage, along with increasingly coordinated pushback, from groups of scientists, climate experts, legal entities, governments, environmental advocates and individuals.

Connecticut is in the thick of it, with its emissions levels and air quality hanging in the balance.

The endangerment finding was specifically targeted for reconsideration in the conservative government playbook Project 2025. In March, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin announced it was under review, denigrating endangerment as “the Holy Grail of the climate change religion.” And on July 29, EPA announced it wanted endangerment gone.

Repealing the finding “will be the largest deregulatory action in the history of America,” Zeldin said.

“We will not let Trump and Zeldin do this without a fight,” said Connecticut Attorney General William Tong at the time. His office is now one of four on a leadership team, with California, New York and Massachusetts heading up a multistate pushback.

While the proposed repeal is viewed as catastrophic, what really incensed opponents and galvanized large group efforts to fight the administration was a draft climate report by the Department of Energy, conducted in secret, released simultaneously with the EPA announcement and used as justification for the repeal.

The DOE report was compiled by a working group of five known climate skeptics, if not outright deniers, handpicked by Energy Secretary Chris Wright. He has since disbanded the group in a letter that disputes the existence of climate change as “settled science.”

The report was not peer-reviewed, as is the norm with such material. It pulled information from existing research. But many scientists whose work was cited said the report cherry-picked information, then misinterpreted and lied about their findings.

Fury ensued.

Jennifer Marlon, executive director of the Yale Center for Geospatial Solutions and senior research scientist at the School of the Environment, who specializes in wildfires and climate change, is one of those whose work was cited. She said she found out through a network of friends and colleagues.

“’Hey, did you see that your paper is cited in this report that kind of says, oh, wildfires are not a problem?’” Marlon recalls hearing.

“DOE directly misinterpreted my study. They cited me and twisted my findings.”

The DOE report, she said, missed the importance of active suppression of wildfires and what it does to fuel sources. And it minimized, if not ignored, the importance of warming temperatures and changing precipitation rates. It used data known to be inaccurate.

“They omit and minimize the importance of climate change in driving uncontrollable wildfires today,” Moran said.

“I spent multiple years working to compile the data behind the article that they reference. And when you invest so much time and effort in careful scientific research, where you think about every sentence that you’re saying and you provide evidence for every claim that you make, and then you see somebody who knows nothing about wildfires whip out some sentences and make these graphs that misrepresent your data,” she said, “it made me angry and upset and motivated me to put down all my other work and say, ‘OK, I’m gonna respond to this.’”

Marlon joined a group of 85 scientists who provided what has become a massive refutation to the DOE report.

The pushback has come from the grassroots of science, but it’s also been increasingly coordinated because of the sheer volume of outrage.

“It is very unique,” Marlon said. ”It kind of comes out of the blue. It rises very quickly. It demands your full attention right now to respond quickly while you can. The Trump administration moves very, very quickly, and they always are starting fires in multiple places so that people are kind of scattered and trying to figure out, ‘how do we address the chaos that’s unfolding?’”

Science group efforts

It fell to Andrew Dessler, a climate scientist and director of the Texas Center for Extreme Weather at Texas A&M, to figure that out. He asked on social media if people like him and Marlon should have a coordinated response and, if so, who was organizing it.

“People took that to mean I was doing it. And so, ultimately, I agreed to do it,” he said.

The plan became to file a group response for both the DOE report and again with EPA on the proposed endangerment rollback. Coming in at some 460 pages — three times the length of the report — the first filing was made in time for the DOE report comment deadline on Sept. 2, which also drew a total of 59,563 written comments. The comment period for the proposed EPA rule rollback goes until Sept. 22.

“By coordinating it, we probably got more people to respond, because everyone sees everyone else doing it and a lot of people working together on sections,” said Dessler, who also said he was shocked at how many emails he got from people wanting to participate. “Also, I think it made the response better.”

He acknowledged the uniqueness of his effort.

“Yeah, it’s unique. What the government’s doing is unique. This is basically a show trial for climate science,” he said. “They picked the jury — all people that say CO2 is innocent — and then they wrote a report.”

In the end, he said, the administration will declare victory, and everybody knows that’s what’s going to happen.

“People are offended. People are doing it because they’re mad that these people are making a mockery of science,” he said. “I’ve spent my entire career doing science. I respect science. Science works.”

The comments the group submitted include experts responding to every section of the DOE report.

Among those participating was Robert Kopp, a noted climate scientist at Rutgers University whose research focuses on sea level rise, climate and their economic impacts. He also holds multiple titles on other climate endeavors and has helped author both national and international top climate reports. He co-edited the submission, co-authored the section on sea level changes, and his previous research was cited throughout.

“My first reaction to opening the DOE report was, ‘wow, that was like a time capsule from 25 years ago,’” Kopp said. “It’s the same people making essentially the same arguments for 25 years even as the evidence of climate change becomes clearer and the evidence of the damages climate change is causing become clearer.

“I feel like, as a scientist, I need to address the cherry picking and misrepresentation that DOE is putting out and that EPA is using.”

Kopp points specifically to subject matter he knows best — the claim in the EPA proposed rule that sea level rise has been minimal. It cites the DOE report, though Kopp says the DOE doesn’t even say that. It offers some contradictory minimal analysis in a couple of citings.

“I think they’ve tried to write the proposed rule such that they could give up on the science argument and still convince the Supreme Court of the validity,” he said.

Carrie Jenks, executive director of the Environmental and Energy Law Program at Harvard Law School, agrees.

“Their primary proposal is to undercut the legal authority to regulate greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act. They’re also proposing to attack the science, but they’re not relying on that. They don’t need to win on the science to undercut the legal authority,” Jenks said.

The goal, she said, seems to be to tie the hands of future administrations to prevent the regulation of greenhouse gases under the current Clean Air Act.

In an emailed statement, an EPA spokesperson appeared to confirm Jenks’ view.

“EPA’s proposal is legal in nature,” it read. “The Endangerment Finding is the legal prerequisite used by the Obama and Biden Administrations to regulate emissions from new motor vehicles and new motor vehicle engines. Absent this finding, EPA would lack statutory authority under Section 202(a) of the Clean Air Act (CAA) to prescribe standards for greenhouse gas emissions. EPA is bound by the laws established by Congress, including under the Clean Air Act. Congress never explicitly gave EPA authority to impose greenhouse gas regulations for cars and trucks.”

In an unusual move, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine have undertaken what they call a fast-track review of the latest evidence for whether greenhouse gas emissions endanger public health and welfare. At the time of the announcement in early August, Marcia McNutt, president of the National Academy of Sciences, said the review was in direct response to EPA’s proposal to rescind endangerment. The report is slated to be released Wednesday.

“Decades of climate research and data have yielded expanded understanding of how greenhouse gases affect the climate,” McNutt said in a statement at the time. “We are undertaking this fresh examination of the latest climate science in order to provide the most up-to-date assessment to policymakers and the public.”

Economists weigh in

Environmental and climate economists have also joined forces to respond to endangerment and the DOE report. So far there’s at least one group of a dozen. It includes Yale’s Ken Gillingham, senior associate dean of academic affairs. He has environmental and energy economics appointments in the environment and management schools and the economics department. He also served on the White House Council of Economic Advisers in the Obama administration.

The group has filed objections to the DOE report, focusing on three chapters with economic assertions. Among its findings are that the economics literature used “is woefully out of date;” that it “employs an array of fallacies” in saying climate damages are small compared with other trends; it accuses the report of using “strawman scenarios and fallacious reasoning” in its cost benefit analysis; and it says the report misrepresents the effect of climate change on agriculture and on secondary issues such has death from heat stress.

Gillingham is mainly focusing on the economic reasoning in the endangerment rollback, along with numbers in the regulatory impact analysis and the proposed rule itself. The group will be filing a new document in time for the Sept. 22 deadline, and Gillingham is also working with a second group of economists that will be filing comment as well.

Gillingham is questioning the EPA’s assertions that the cost of cars will increase, the choices for cars will decrease and old polluting cars will stay on the road longer.

“It’s disingenuous to be worried about increasing car prices when implementing a massive tariff policy that’s raising car prices,” he said. “They’re clearly not worried so much about car prices. They’re just trying to destroy environmental regulations.”

What Gillingham sees at work is influential parties who stand to lose money from a decarbonized economy.

“It’s inconvenient to have climate policy — to a set of people whose fortunes depend on fossil fuels,” he said. “They are very keen to see a rollback of the endangerment finding and anything that can be done to make it very difficult to regulate greenhouse gases. That’s fundamentally what’s going on.”

Legal pushback

While scientists and economists are coalescing to push back against the double-barreled endangerment rollback, a group of more than two dozen state attorneys general and chief legal officers in several cities are also coming together, as they have frequently in Trump’s second term.

The attorneys general, including Connecticut’s William Tong, have already filed an amicus brief in support of a lawsuit filed by the Environmental Defense Fund and the Union of Concerned Scientists that alleges the U.S. Department of Energy did not follow proper procedures in establishing the group that compiled the DOE report.

The group also filed 85 pages of comments against the report itself — enumerating the volumes of peer-reviewed research the report ignored and a 122-page appendix of state-by-state climate change impacts. Connecticut’s section notes the observed temperature increases, rise in sea levels that exceeds the global average and the region’s increase in climate extremes including storm intensity, rates of precipitation, flooding, heat and drought and the impacts from all of them.

A representative of Tong’s office has already testified during a live comment period on the legality of the Trump administration’s plan to dump endangerment. In the allotted two-and-a-half minutes, the testimony focused on how the proposed repeal denies the scientific reality that climate change is happening; that endangerment can only be changed by Congress, not the EPA; and that the proposal ignores health and other benefits of climate protection.

There were more than 600 live comments over four days of testimony (extended from the originally scheduled two days), that, according to observers, ran about 97% against and 3% in favor.

As of Sept. 15, more than 92,000 written comments were submitted on the endangerment repeal. The AG group filing on that will be a much-expanded version of its DOE comments.

“We’re pushing back on the junk science, but we’re also going to push back legally, procedurally and substantively legally that this is an illegal approach to rescinding the endangerment finding,” said Matthew Levine, deputy associate Connecticut attorney general and chief of the environment section. “I’ve been working on this stuff for decades, and the science is only continuing to improve and get better with specificity. We feel really confident on the facts and the support for it, and we also feel really confident on the legal issues as well.”

Endangerment in brief

Endangerment goes back to a 2007 U.S. Supreme Court ruling — Massachusetts v. EPA — that paved the way for EPA to regulate greenhouse gas emissions in motor vehicles in addition to the standard pollutants it had been regulating under the iconic Clean Air Act since it came into its modern existence in 1970.

The Act’s language says said that the EPA is required to regulate any air pollutant the administrator finds if the administrator finds they “cause, or contribute to, air pollution which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare.”

Two years later, the administrator did just that, and greenhouse gases — six of them — have been regulated as pollutants since.

It’s widely assumed the EPA will go ahead with rolling back endangerment. So it’s also widely assumed this matter will wind up back before the U.S. Supreme Court. Three of the four justices who voted against it originally remain on the court: Chief Justice John Roberts, Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito. None of the five justices who voted for it remain.

The use of the finding has been stretched since the original ruling to justify requiring emissions reductions from power plants and industrial facilities. In a related matter, the EPA proposed a rule on Sept. 12 to discontinue the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program signed into law in 2007 by President George W. Bush. The rule, which began operating a decade ago, required annual reporting of emissions by refineries, factories and other large industrial operations to make the public aware of emissions as a first step towards limiting them.

But the focus of endangerment in the current instance is for motor vehicles. And while the overall issue is wonky to the average person, it has a major impact on their lives, especially here in Connecticut.

Connecticut’s emissions

Connecticut set itself greenhouse gas emissions reduction goals to meet between now and 2050, when overall emissions are supposed to be 80% below 2001 levels. The annual GHG Inventory released by the state Department of Energy and Environmental Protection earlier this month shows the state continues to be off-track to meet its goals.

The transportation sector, which constitutes the largest source of those emissions, provided a small bright spot. Its emissions were down 2% in 2023 (the most recent data available) over 2022. Prior to the pandemic, during which emissions dipped dramatically, it had been trending up slightly. But to reach its sector goals, the rate of decrease will need to increase 3.6-fold to meet its next benchmark in 2030.

It is likely the 2023 decrease was driven by greater adoption of electric and more fuel-efficient vehicles, as well as power sector emissions reductions mandated during the Biden administration that would have helped clean up power plants upwind of Connecticut. But the potential rollback of endangerment, along with the Trump administration’s elimination of electric vehicle tax credits and other motor vehicle efficiency measures, including the more restrictive emissions levels some states follow, may send them back up.

“We are concerned that recent actions by the EPA to roll back power plant regulations, vehicle fuel economy standards, and even the Endangerment Finding will remove critical federal tools that contributed to this progress,” said DEEP Commissioner Katie Dykes in a statement that accompanied the report’s release.

DEEP would not make anyone available to discuss the endangerment repeal effort or the DOE report specifically, though Deputy Commissioner for Environmental Quality Emma Cimino did speak during the EPA live testimony on endangerment.

“Greenhouse gas emissions significantly impact human health by contributing to climate change, which in turn leads to various health problems including respiratory illnesses, heat-related illnesses, infectious disease outbreaks, food and water insecurity, and mental health issues,” Connecticut Public Health Commissioner Manisha Juthani said in a statement at the time. “Amid the EPA pulling back on these efforts, Connecticut will hold our values to protect and improve the health and safety of our residents.”

“If you want to address the contributions of climate change from Connecticut, there’s no way to do it without making rapid and large reductions in gasoline use,” said David Reichmuth, a senior scientist in the clean transportation program at the Union of Concerned Scientists. The EPA’s changes, he said, mean car buyers will have options that are less efficient and with higher emissions. “That‘s going to take us in the wrong direction. In a time where we need to be going as quickly as possible to reduce emissions, we’re going to be actually increasing emissions.”

The Trump administration argues in the endangerment rollback that the higher cost of EVs — now exacerbated by the loss of the EV tax credit coupled with tariffs, which Reichmuth calls disingenuous on the administration’s part — will cause people to hang onto existing dirtier cars for longer. It also claims lower emissions rules by class of vehicle means that any changes in each class will be negligible.

“The idea that the emissions from vehicles don’t matter — it flies in the face of all the of the data we have,” Reichmuth said, calling such arguments “absurd.”

He points out that even if the next administration were to reimpose tough GHG auto emission standards, the cars purchased under more permissive Trump standards could stay on the road for well over a decade. “You’re locking in decades of emissions from those new vehicles,” he said.

Advocates band together

Scientists like Harvard’s Carrie Jenks believe that public input will also be critical to the their cause in this effort.

“I think it’s important for stakeholders to give EPA as much information as they can,” she said. “I think it’s going to be important for EPA to really dig into that, and it’s going to be interesting to see how they do that.”

The Union of Concerned Scientists, like other advocacy groups, is no stranger to group efforts. It has sent out multiple emails requesting individuals file comments on endangerment and contact lawmakers. But Rachel Cleetus, the group’s senior policy director with the climate and energy program, said this one isn’t taking take much effort.

“This report is so egregious that it hasn’t even required a big coordinated effort,” she said. “Within 24 hours, there were scientists on the media, on social media, writing, from the perspective of their expertise, that this was just wrong. So many errors in this report, blatant, complete obfuscation of scientific facts.”

Cleetus was also among the hundreds who gave live testimony on the endangerment repeal effort. She said, as she waited her turn, that what struck her was the ordinary citizens who stepped up, like a woman from Texas on the panel before hers.

“She spoke so movingly about the impacts of Hurricane Harvey and then the recent floods in Texas and what it has meant for people in her community,” Cleetus said. “It’s heartbreaking, it’s enraging, actually. … This is not just political football. This really affects people’s lives.”

Among other organizing efforts, the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University immediately provided a full explanation of the issue along with templates for comment letters for both individuals and governments.

The Climate Action Campaign, CAC, which is a coalition of major national environmental, environmental justice and public health groups representing about 15 million members across the country, has stepped up.

Executive Director Margie Alt said their tactical approach is both group and individual efforts, but a couple of things are different this time. First, the Trump administration seems more organized than it was in the first administration, and the fossil fuel interests operating within it are exerting more pressure.

“I’d say the other thing that’s different, though, is that people across the country are experiencing climate change every single day,” she said. “We’re just seeing incredible, incredible public response, especially as people are affected by extreme weather, which they understand to be supercharged by the climate crisis.”

She, and many others, accused the Trump administration of making climate denial the official policy of the U.S.

“I don’t think the public is going to stand for it,” Alt said.

At the Natural Resources Defense Council, Madeline Hankins, the group’s federal climate legal director, said the organization is pulling out all the stops.

Hankins said they knew what rollbacks were coming but not how quickly and widespread.

“We have required some level of sort of coordination and capacity and trying to figure out, ‘OK, it’s all hands on deck, but who’s going to handle what, and how are we going to address this?’” Hankins said.

Most inspiring, Hankins said, were the tens of thousands of members who have filed comments and that, even at the height of summer, “we’re seeing scientists band together to really rebut this report, and they’re coming out of the woodwork to talk about how their research is being misquoted.”

That may have been what motivated Yale’s Marlon to begin with. But she also sees the contrast with the previous federal climate policies she said were designed to improve people’s health, provide cleaner air, cleaner water, lower the temperatures globally, and to even make money doing it.

“All of these tools and policies were like a road map to a safer, cleaner future,” she said. “Basically what these new efforts are doing are taking that map, tossing it out the window, turning off the headlights in the car, and stepping on the accelerator towards a cliff. It’s really endangering the lives of millions of people.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/alz-indiana-7.29.25.jpeg,N,,2025-09-16 05:58:56.033918

But there’s little doubt that data centers are on the rise, propelled by the AI explosion.
“We can come to the table,” said John Burns, general counsel for Carolinas Clean Energy Business Association, a trade group representing developers, manufacturers, and others in the clean energy industry.
And for AI data centers, the quicker the better: In Virginia, the world’s data center capital, construction of the facilities takes 18 months or less.
North Carolina regulators could consider inducements for so-called “energy parks,” where data centers and other large loads would be clustered around their new energy sources, reducing interconnection delays and the need for transmission upgrades.","In small communities across North Carolina, data centers are already sparking conflict over land use, water use, and quality of life. Now, the debate over the facilities’ voracious need for electricity — and whether it can be met with clean sources — is heating up in the state capital of Raleigh.

For months, North Carolina’s predominant utility, Duke Energy, has forecast ballooning demand from large customers like data centers: immense buildings that house the computing devices powering AI and other software that’s become part of everyday life.

Early last year, Duke projected these “large loads” would need an additional 3.9 gigawatts of capacity, equal to about four nuclear power plants and enough to serve millions of households. By May of this year, the company’s prediction had swelled to almost 6 gigawatts.

The eye-popping estimates helped lead regulators to approve Duke’s current plan to build a massive new fleet of gas plants, alongside some clean energy investments, despite a state law requiring the utility to decarbonize. The projections are certain to factor into the next iteration of Duke’s long-term blueprint, a draft of which is due in the coming weeks.

The forecasts have “thrown everything out of whack,” said Nick Jimenez, senior attorney with the Southern Environmental Law Center.

That’s why his organization asked the state’s Utilities Commission to host a technical conference on large loads. Electricity-demand projections undergird virtually every Duke case before the panel. But at a technical conference, commissioners could grapple exclusively with the issues vexing energy experts across the country: How can data center demand be predicted with the most accuracy? Will the tech giants pay their fair share of grid upgrades and other costs? What will power the new facilities, and will it be carbon-free?

In June, the Utilities Commission granted the law center’s request and then some by opening an entire proceeding to debate these questions. Stakeholders had the summer to submit written comments, with responses due from Duke early this month. In-person presentations are scheduled for Oct. 14.

It’s not clear if the process will culminate in a discrete order from the commission, or simply inform the myriad other Duke cases before it. But Jimenez praised regulators for being proactive. “You need a proceeding to get your arms around some of these issues,” he said. “I think that's really smart and forward-looking.”

The data center boom

In the race against other states to attract economic development, Duke and North Carolina officials keep confidential exactly which entities hope to draw power from the electric grid. And skeptics question whether all of the new facilities behind predictions of unprecedented demand growth will pan out.

But there’s little doubt that data centers are on the rise, propelled by the AI explosion. Researchers say they could account for 44% of U.S. load growth by 2028, and there’s ample evidence that North Carolina is following the national trend.

In June, Amazon Web Services announced a $10 billion, 800-acre computing campus in Richmond County, east of Charlotte, billed as the largest single capital project in North Carolina history. To the west of Charlotte, the development of a “data center corridor” is underway: Apple says its Catawba County site is included in its $500 billion U.S. expansion plans, and Microsoft envisions four new data centers nearby. Google is considering growing its facility in neighboring Caldwell County.

Not all communities are welcoming data centers with open arms. The town council of tiny Tarboro, an hour east of Raleigh, just voted to reject a $6.4 billion facility. In Apex, southwest of the city, opposition is mounting to a proposed “digital campus” that would displace 190 acres of farmland.

Still, early this month, Gov. Josh Stein, a Democrat and former attorney general, issued an executive order creating an “AI Accelerator” and a council designed to make the state “a national leader in AI literacy, governance, and deployment to the benefit of our residents, communities, and economy.”

Stein did note the technology’s downsides, including “the uncertainty around AI systems and their associated energy and water needs.” But his edict also reflects the seeming common wisdom of the moment: AI and its requisite facilities are multiplying and expanding, bringing economic opportunities that can outweigh their challenges.

“We can come to the table”

In the open docket before regulators, experts say that with the right policies in place, clean energy, efficiency, and related strategies can meet the moment. “We can come to the table,” said John Burns, general counsel for Carolinas Clean Energy Business Association, a trade group representing developers, manufacturers, and others in the clean energy industry.

In their comments, Burns and others particularly promoted “load flexibility,” a form of demand response in which data centers curtail their electricity use when the grid is strained by lots of energy consumption.

Load flexibility is feasible because data centers don’t run at maximum capacity 24/7, said Tyler Norris, former special adviser at the U.S. Department of Energy and a doctoral fellow at Duke University, which has no connection to the utility.

“You never actually run the chips and the servers to 100% of their rated nameplate power,” he said. “You wouldn't want to, because they overheat and they don't perform as well when they're running that hard.”

Norris is the lead author of a February paper showing that Duke’s two utilities in the Carolinas could accommodate 4.1 gigawatts of load if data centers shave just 0.5% off their peak usage annually. In a simple example, the facilities could operate at half their maximum capacity for 88 hours over the course of a year.

A load-flexibility arrangement between Duke Energy and data centers could, in theory, avert the construction of several gigawatts of new gas plant capacity and expensive and time-consuming transmission upgrades.

Last month, Google announced demand-response agreements with the utilities Indiana Michigan Power and the Tennessee Valley Authority. In formal comments to the North Carolina Utilities Commission, Norris called the tech giant’s move the “first documented case where AI data center flexibility is explicitly integrated into U.S. utility planning.”

That’s why he hopes North Carolina regulators will study other means of incorporating curtailment, perhaps starting with voluntary measures, into Duke’s long-term plans.

“I think we need more creative thinking, and dialogue, and analysis around this kind of flexibility opportunity,” Norris told Canary Media. “It just has such substantial implications for affordability and reliability.”

Clean, cheap, quick

Even if Norris’ calculations bear out, Duke Energy’s projections show it will need hundreds more megawatts of power capacity in the next decade for large loads alone. And for AI data centers, the quicker the better: In Virginia, the world’s data center capital, construction of the facilities takes 18 months or less.

That’s where utility-scale solar and storage could be especially useful, said Burns. “Not only are the resources of our members clean,” he added, “they're also less expensive and quicker to market.”

A June report from global investment firm Lazard concludes that land-based wind turbines and large solar farms “remain the most cost-effective forms of new-build energy generation on an unsubsidized basis.”

By contrast, Lazard says, “the cost of building a new combined cycle gas turbine has reached a 10-year high. Turbine shortages, rising costs, and long delivery times are expected to continue driving steep [levelized cost of energy] increases for gas technologies in the near term.”

The North Carolina Department of Commerce has adopted Gov. Stein’s “all-of-the-above energy deployment approach,” said Jennifer Mundt, the agency’s assistant secretary for energy and infrastructure. But renewables align with the department’s economic development mission because nearly half of all Fortune 500 companies aim to reach net-zero emissions by 2050, Mundt wrote in her letter to utility commissioners. “Companies are prioritizing sites with access to diverse energy sources,” she noted, as well as those with affordable, reliable electricity.

Especially after the legislature repealed a key target for emissions reductions this summer, many tech giants now have more aggressive clean energy goals than the state. Amazon has pledged net-zero carbon emissions across its global operations by 2040. Google aims to power its data centers with 24/7 carbon-free energy by 2030.

“Google leadership remains firmly committed to this goal,” the company said in its comments to regulators, “making it critical that we are able to identify viable pathways to supporting new carbon-free energy resources as we continue to grow our business.”

A best-case scenario for the clean energy transition?

In their comments to regulators, experts highlight a range of policies that would help data center growth align with — rather than contravene — the clean energy transition.

A voluntary “clean transition tariff,” for instance, would allow data centers to pay for new renewables to come online, rather than just chip in for carbon-free energy already in the works. In Nevada, Google partnered with utility NV Energy on such a scheme, which will enable 115 megawatts of around-the-clock geothermal power to supply the company’s data centers.

North Carolina regulators could consider inducements for so-called “energy parks,” where data centers and other large loads would be clustered around their new energy sources, reducing interconnection delays and the need for transmission upgrades. The on-site energy generation could increase the resilience of the grid as a whole, serving as backup power for the utility.

Indeed, “virtual” or “distributed” power plants, whereby utilities can access non-centralized energy resources during times of need, could help avoid the construction of new power plants, saving utilities and their customers billions of dollars.

The practice is already being tested elsewhere in the U.S. Black Hills Energy negotiated a contract with Microsoft that allows the utility to tap backup generation at the tech company’s Cheyenne, Wyoming, data center during periods of high electricity demand.

For Jimenez of the Southern Environmental Law Center, the best-case scenario is that the regulators adopt these and other policies suggested by advocates, such that “the large load that comes to the state pays for its own clean generation, and the rest of us don't pay excessive bills.”

The worst-case scenario, he said, “would be to do nothing.”

Of course, doing nothing is a distinct possibility. Like all investor-owned, monopoly utilities, Duke is financially motivated to invest in as many capital assets as possible, to be paid back with interest by captive customers. Though it was overridden, the utility opposed the Southern Environmental Law Center’s original request for a technical conference.

In September comments to the commission, Duke said there is “no need to rush into major changes” or “any paradigm shift.” It pointedly argued against reforms that might take place outside a general rate case or the long-term planning process. It acknowledged the risk of building new power plants that may not be used fully by large loads, but asserted that existing regulatory processes and other factors assure that in the short-term, “there is more than ample protection against investment in generation assets that are not needed.”

What’s more, it bodes ill that last year’s much-vaunted agreement between Duke and data center giants to develop a clean transition tariff in the Carolinas appears to have fizzled: Despite promises otherwise, the utility has yet to request such a tariff.

But Duke’s September comments did offer a few rays of hope for advocates. Load flexibility, it suggested, is no panacea, but the company acknowledged that “well-structured flexible operations can provide benefits for customers.”

On virtual power plants, the company said it is “open to all ideas that could provide benefits to the system as a whole and are compliant with applicable law. … Creative engagement around such ideas is essential.”",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/3pitajASC9KfpfsOSyvUug--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD03NjI7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/canary_media_articles_453/24433c5b843a5de4a51c0e225823b9a0,N,,2025-09-16 04:57:47.274922

The solar industry is already navigating dramatic policy changes as a result of HR1.
The association also cautioned that slower solar growth could undermine the administration’s broader economic and technological goals, including ambitions in artificial intelligence development.","The U.S. solar industry added nearly 18 gigawatts (GW) of new capacity in the first half of 2025, even as the Trump administration introduced a series of policies aimed at limiting clean energy growth. According to the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) and Wood Mackenzie’s U.S. Solar Market Insight Q3 2025 report, solar and energy storage together made up 82% of all new power capacity connected to the grid during this period. However, the report warns that recent federal actions, including the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (HR1), are creating significant headwinds for future growth.

The report’s low-case forecast suggests that these policies could cause the United States to lose 44 GW of planned solar deployment by 2030—an 18% decline from previous estimates. When compared with pre-HR1 projections, the total potential loss rises to 55 GW, representing a 21% drop in expected capacity by the end of the decade. Despite these challenges, 77% of the solar capacity installed so far in 2025 has been added in states carried by President Trump in the last election. Eight of the top 10 states for new solar installations—Texas, Indiana, Arizona, Florida, Ohio, Missouri, Kentucky, and Arkansas—are among these states.

Manufacturing capacity has also grown significantly in early 2025, with 13 GW of new or expanded solar module production facilities coming online in Texas, Indiana, and Minnesota. This brings total U.S. module manufacturing capacity to 55 GW. However, no new upstream manufacturing investments were recorded in the second quarter of 2025, as federal policy uncertainty threatens to stall momentum and deter billions of dollars in private investment.

Abigail Ross Hopper, SEIA president and CEO, stated, “Solar and storage are the backbone of America’s energy future, delivering the majority of new power to the grid at the lowest cost to families and businesses. Instead of unleashing this American economic engine, the Trump administration is deliberately stifling investment, which is raising energy costs for families and businesses, and jeopardizing the reliability of our electric grid. But no matter what policies this administration releases, the solar and storage industry will continue to grow, because the market is demanding what we’re delivering: reliable, affordable, American-made energy.”

Michelle Davis, head of solar research at Wood Mackenzie, mentioned, “There is considerable downside risk for the solar industry if the federal permitting environment creates more constraints for solar projects. The solar industry is already navigating dramatic policy changes as a result of HR1. Further uncertainty from federal policy actions is making the business environment for the solar industry incredibly challenging.”

Looking ahead, the report forecasts that overall solar deployment will be about 4% lower by 2030 compared with projections made before HR1 was enacted. Short-term growth is supported by projects already under development, developers rushing to meet tax credit deadlines, and rising electricity demand as natural gas generation becomes more expensive and less reliable. Still, recent executive actions from the Department of the Interior (DOI) could delay or halt many planned projects. The DOI’s new permitting rules, which specifically target solar projects for stricter treatment, could affect roughly 44 GW of planned capacity—particularly in Arizona, California, and Nevada.

SEIA has urged DOI Secretary Doug Burgum to reverse these actions, warning that if they remain in place, they could lead to job losses, higher electricity prices, and reduced competitiveness for the U.S. economy. The association also cautioned that slower solar growth could undermine the administration’s broader economic and technological goals, including ambitions in artificial intelligence development. To address these challenges, SEIA has released a grid reliability policy agenda outlining key steps local, state, and federal leaders should take to strengthen the electric grid through greater use of solar and energy storage technologies, ensuring a stable and affordable power supply to meet the country’s growing energy needs.",https://solarquarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pexels-photo-356036.jpeg,N,,2025-09-16 04:57:54.850590

The Trump administration had declared an energy emergency, then set about reducing energy supply by going after renewables projects. The massive spending law yanked nearly seven years of tax credits for wind and solar. The White House arbitrarily halted construction on two major offshore wind farms that had all their permits in order, raising the fear that it might block other fully approved projects. Tariffs have changed the price of parts that go into clean energy equipment on a sometimes weekly basis. The cleantech bankruptcies have been relentless: Powin, Sunnova, Mosaic, Northvolt, Li-Cycle, Nikola, to name a few.

“I can’t think of a time when we have been subject to quite as much of a brutal swing as we’ve been in now,” said Abby Ross Hopper, president and CEO of the Solar Energy Industries Association, which puts on the conference.

But when I got to the exhibit hall at the Venetian Expo, it stretched farther than I’d ever seen at a clean energy show, and I heard rumors of additional halls above and below. The exhibitors even sprawled across a sunwashed bridge to Caesar’s Forum, where vendors of flow batteries and other alternative technologies hawked their wares, quite fittingly, from the periphery of the event.

Final attendance for the show hit 37,000, just shy of the record 40,000 from the previous two years, and other metrics broke records. The mood on the floor, in the halls, and at the myriad Vegas afterparties reflected an industry that had taken some punches, had lost some nice things, but was nonetheless charging forward, resolute and battle-tested.

“If you’d asked me in May how I was feeling about RE+, I would have a very different answer,” Hopper noted at a roundtable with journalists a few days into the show. ​“But we have more exhibitors than we’ve ever had in our history, and we have more registration revenue than we’ve ever had in our history. … [People] are really, really hungry for information and for a vision for what’s coming next.”

Judging by this year’s dire headlines, the show’s ebullient atmosphere does not seem entirely rational. Of course, even teetering startups try to project confidence among peers, customers, and especially journalists. And the overstimulated Vegas backdrop inspires a particular strain of optimism, the kind that encourages you to light cash on fire and feel lucky for the opportunity.

But after three days of roaming the frenetic halls, I came to see this year’s positive outlook as warranted. The general consensus among conference goers seemed to be that though political headwinds are blowing hard, economic tailwinds are blowing harder. Here are three reasons why I think they are right.

Forget policy, look at the markets

With the federal tax credits cut short, fewer solar projects will get built, and costs will rise for the ones that still go forward, passing on higher energy bills to American consumers.

But, with a little distance from the sting of this summer’s legislative setbacks, many solar and energy storage professionals believe losses in the policy arena are counterbalanced by increasingly rosy outlooks in the marketplace.

“I think people tend to over-orient on the policy story, and under-orient on the economic and financial story,” said Alfred Johnson, CEO of the clean energy financing platform Crux, as we sipped espressos outside the hubbub of the cavernous expo halls.

Johnson’s company launched as a marketplace for tax credit transferability, which was created by the Inflation Reduction Act, but has expanded into other forms of financing, like debt and tax equity. That perch gives him visibility into clean energy project economics and the flows of capital into the sector. He ticked off a series of key factors defining the current energy market: Electricity prices are way up; solar and battery keeps getting cheaper while improving performance; gas prices are rising as the Trump administration promotes exports; gas turbine prices are rising due to intense competition from buyers.

In short, it’s a bad time to be someone who uses electricity in America, despite President Donald Trump’s campaign promise to cut energy prices. That means, though, that it’s a great time to be someone who sells power.

Even better for power producers, the biggest new customers — data centers — have the price sensitivity of a ravenous grizzly bear. They’re trying, with the enthusiastic support of the White House, to win a global arms race to unlock artificial superintelligence, whatever that means. Facing such civilizational stakes, the hyperscalers aren’t going to quibble over nickels and dimes.

Even with elevated electricity prices, hyperscalers still have to pay a lot more for the ​“graphics processing units” that train and run their AI models, Johnson noted. And once they’ve paid for those GPUs, they want to use them as much as possible, which means gobbling up as much electricity as they can get.

“The value of being faster on delivering the model … is worth so much more … than the additional cost of energy, which means that the marginal demand in a lot of these markets is the data centers, who are not price sensitive,” Johnson said.

Solar is clearly the cheapest source of new electricity production. But what matters most now is speed to market, and here solar and batteries easily trounce all other commercially viable sources of power. Taking mass-produced panels and parts and assembling them in a field is fundamentally easier than constructing a traditional large power plant. And it’s a hell of a lot easier than some of the hyperscalers’ other ideas, like building nonexistent nuclear fusion plants, or nonexistent small modular reactors, or restarting a long-shuttered nuclear reactor at the notorious Three Mile Island plant.

These dynamics led some of my fellow conference goers to muse about a counterfactual choice: Would you rather have strong federal policy tailwinds and an unfavorable market, or booming market fundamentals but unfavorable policy? Nine months ago, the industry enjoyed both. Trump ended those good times, but the robust market serves to mollify the pain of his policy attacks.

Solar got whacked, but storage is booming

SEIA has strived to welcome energy storage into the fold, and diversification from solar alone looks especially prescient these days. Rooftop solar is struggling in a big way, with the federal onslaught and friendly fire from states like California, and large-scale developers are racing to cram in a bumper crop of projects before tax credits disappear next July. (Projects that start construction after that must be operating by the end of 2027 to qualify for the federal incentives.) But storage companies evaded the policy setbacks of their solar-powered brethren, and are building toward yet another record year of construction.

“Right now, we are seeing all of the factors are very supportive to storage,” said Johnson. ​“Demand is going up, there’s more of a focus on having dispatchable power. It got tax credits for the first time in the IRA … and then it retained the tax credits in [the One Big Beautiful Bill Act].”

The budget law preserves the battery-installation tax credits through 2033, with the stipulation that projects prove they don’t excessively rely on parts or corporate support from China. That sparked initial concerns from some analysts that these Foreign Entity of Concern rules (FEOC) could be enforced in a way that strangles development arbitrarily.

A few months later, many storage developers are encouraged by how clearly the text of the law lays out the boxes to check. Even so, compliance creates extra work for the American companies trying to expand the capacity of the grid, and the law does not explicitly encourage domestic manufacturing, since the rules are anti-China rather than pro-America.

Trump’s tariffs also pose a unique threat to storage, because so many of the battery cells used in these projects come from China. The U.S. has only just begun building supply chains for lithium ferrous phosphate, the battery chemistry now favored for grid storage. LG opened an LFP factory in Michigan this summer; AESC did so in an old Nissan Leaf battery plant in Tennessee, and Tesla is working on one in Nevada slated to start up early next year.

Now, said Brian Hayes, CEO of storage developer Key Capture Energy, it’s common for suppliers to offer three battery-sourcing options: China, Southeast Asia, and domestic. Buyers can toggle based on current tariff rates, U.S. manufacturing premiums, and the FEOC obligations of a particular project. Once the new FEOC rules kick in, though, the industry will need to move away from Chinese-made battery cells.

“I’m feeling a lot more positive today than I was six months ago,” said Hayes, whose company has built 40 megawatts in New York and 580 megawatts in Texas. ​“We ended up in a good place.”

That’s not to say storage developers can afford to get complacent.

“We can’t rest on our laurels,” Hayes mused. ​“We always have to be paying attention to what else could come.”

Domestic supply chains are developing in spite of the chaos

The Biden administration combined trade policy with methodical domestic incentives to reshore the manufacturing of clean energy equipment and other tech, like semiconductors. Trump supports the resurgence of domestic manufacturing in theory, but his primary tactic for that goal has been frequently shifting and legally dubious tariffs. These policies raise the price for materials that American manufacturers need to make their products and for the equipment required to build new factories, and they undermine the long-term certainty that reassures investors.

Still, the reshoring of clean energy supply chains has continued, and signs touting FEOC compliance have become a new form of currency on the expo hall floors.

Nextracker, the homegrown solar-tracking manufacturer and publicly traded cleantech success story, used the occasion of the conference to publicize its acquisition of Origami Solar for $53 million. That marked a refreshing shift in an era when cleantech acquisitions have tended to feature bankruptcy auctions or the kind of firesale where participants abashedly refuse to share the purchase price.

Origami developed a steel frame technology to replace the usual aluminum frames that wrap around solar panels. This enhances structural integrity as solar modules grow ever larger and more powerful. Indiana manufacturer Bila Solar, for instance, recently tapped Origami to frame its new 550-watt solar module.

But beyond preventing bending or buckling, the acquisition is a domestic-production play. The U.S. aluminium industry has cratered since the 1980s, so aluminum frames are now largely an import business, subject to all the vagaries of trade in 2025. The U.S. still makes things with steel though; Nextracker has been working with partners to open steel plants around the country to produce the torque tubes that carry the panels through their daily rotation. Origami manufactures in the U.S. too; now Nextracker can offer a more complete domestic solar package, making it easier for developers to clinch the 10% tax credit adder for Made-in-America content.

Over in Texas, module manufacturer T1 Energy signed a deal a few weeks back with glass producer Corning for a lot more than oven-safe casserole dishes. Corning subsidiary Hemlock Semiconductor will make hyper-pure polysilicon and carve it into solar wafers in Michigan, to supply T1’s forthcoming solar cell factory starting in the second half of 2026.

I tracked down Alex Zhu, CEO of ES Foundry, which in January opened one of the only currently operating solar cell factories in the country. Production from the 1-gigawatt line in Greenwood, South Carolina, is already sold out until 2027, Zhu said. He has greenlit a 2-gigawatt expansion, slated to be fully running by June 2026, to meet demand from domestic panel producers. A digital display by the company’s booth advertised ​“No FEOC Ownership. No FEOC Board. No FEOC Funding.”

Zhu stressed that it wasn’t easy opening a cell factory when the U.S. lacks a supply chain for some of the industrial inputs that are abundant and cheap in China. One of the key gases used in the process cost him 120 times the rate it sells for in that country’s solar industry centers. But Zhu nonetheless raised investment, launched the company, and built the factory all in the last two years.

That’s a clear risk factor, because that perk will disappear along with the solar tax credits. But tax rules say that if developers start construction before next July 4, they can take up to four years to finish projects. That means projects could get built with both the credit and the domestic content adder through the end of the decade.

It’s hard to know what context manufacturers will be operating in at that point. But Zhu noted that ​“after five years, we definitely need to move to the next generation.” Much like semiconductor fabs, solar cell factories must regularly refresh themselves to keep up with technological advancements.

Longer-term certainty would be nice for the generational effort to reshore the solar supply chain, but maybe five busy years of manufacturing is enough to look forward to right now.",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/GettyImages-905962646.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=8a75596548d90ced84649f6c48e7fd0a,N,,2025-09-16 03:59:42.757351

Early last year, Duke projected these ​“large loads” would need an additional 3.9 gigawatts of capacity, equal to about four nuclear power plants and enough to serve millions of households. By May of this year, the company’s prediction had swelled to almost 6 gigawatts.

The eye-popping estimates helped lead regulators to approve Duke’s current plan to build a massive new fleet of gas plants, alongside some clean energy investments, despite a state law requiring the utility to decarbonize. The projections are certain to factor into the next iteration of Duke’s long-term blueprint, a draft of which is due in the coming weeks.

The forecasts have ​“thrown everything out of whack,” said Nick Jimenez, senior attorney with the Southern Environmental Law Center.

That’s why his organization asked the state’s Utilities Commission to host a technical conference on large loads. Electricity-demand projections undergird virtually every Duke case before the panel. But at a technical conference, commissioners could grapple exclusively with the issues vexing energy experts across the country: How can data center demand be predicted with the most accuracy? Will the tech giants pay their fair share of grid upgrades and other costs? What will power the new facilities, and will it be carbon-free?

In June, the Utilities Commission granted the law center’s request and then some by opening an entire proceeding to debate these questions. Stakeholders had the summer to submit written comments, with responses due from Duke early this month. In-person presentations are scheduled for Oct. 14.

It’s not clear if the process will culminate in a discrete order from the commission, or simply inform the myriad other Duke cases before it. But Jimenez praised regulators for being proactive. ​“You need a proceeding to get your arms around some of these issues,” he said. ​“I think that’s really smart and forward-looking.”

The data center boom

In the race against other states to attract economic development, Duke and North Carolina officials keep confidential exactly which entities hope to draw power from the electric grid. And skeptics question whether all of the new facilities behind predictions of unprecedented demand growth will pan out.

But there’s little doubt that data centers are on the rise, propelled by the AI explosion. Researchers say they could account for 44% of U.S. load growth by 2028, and there’s ample evidence that North Carolina is following the national trend.

In June, Amazon Web Services announced a $10 billion, 800-acre computing campus in Richmond County, east of Charlotte, billed as the largest single capital project in North Carolina history. To the west of Charlotte, the development of a ​“data center corridor” is underway: Apple says its Catawba County site is included in its $500 billion U.S. expansion plans, and Microsoft envisions four new data centers nearby. Google is considering growing its facility in neighboring Caldwell County.

Not all communities are welcoming data centers with open arms. The town council of tiny Tarboro, an hour east of Raleigh, just voted to reject a $6.4 billion facility. In Apex, southwest of the city, opposition is mounting to a proposed ​“digital campus” that would displace 190 acres of farmland.

Still, early this month, Gov. Josh Stein, a Democrat and former attorney general, issued an executive order creating an ​“AI Accelerator” and a council designed to make the state ​“a national leader in AI literacy, governance, and deployment to the benefit of our residents, communities, and economy.”

Stein did note the technology’s downsides, including ​“the uncertainty around AI systems and their associated energy and water needs.” But his edict also reflects the seeming common wisdom of the moment: AI and its requisite facilities are multiplying and expanding, bringing economic opportunities that can outweigh their challenges.

“We can come to the table”

In the open docket before regulators, experts say that with the right policies in place, clean energy, efficiency, and related strategies can meet the moment. ​“We can come to the table,” said John Burns, general counsel for Carolinas Clean Energy Business Association, a trade group representing developers, manufacturers, and others in the clean energy industry.

In their comments, Burns and others particularly promoted ​“load flexibility,” a form of demand response in which data centers curtail their electricity use when the grid is strained by lots of energy consumption.

Load flexibility is feasible because data centers don’t run at maximum capacity 24/7, said Tyler Norris, former special adviser at the U.S. Department of Energy and a doctoral fellow at Duke University, which has no connection to the utility.

“You never actually run the chips and the servers to 100% of their rated nameplate power,” he said. ​“You wouldn’t want to, because they overheat and they don’t perform as well when they’re running that hard.”

Norris is the lead author of a February paper showing that Duke’s two utilities in the Carolinas could accommodate 4.1 gigawatts of load if data centers shave just 0.5% off their peak usage annually. In a simple example, the facilities could operate at half their maximum capacity for 88 hours over the course of a year.

A load-flexibility arrangement between Duke Energy and data centers could, in theory, avert the construction of several gigawatts of new gas plant capacity and expensive and time-consuming transmission upgrades.

Last month, Google announced demand-response agreements with the utilities Indiana Michigan Power and the Tennessee Valley Authority. In formal comments to the North Carolina Utilities Commission, Norris called the tech giant’s move the ​“first documented case where AI data center flexibility is explicitly integrated into U.S. utility planning.”

That’s why he hopes North Carolina regulators will study other means of incorporating curtailment, perhaps starting with voluntary measures, into Duke’s long-term plans.

“I think we need more creative thinking, and dialogue, and analysis around this kind of flexibility opportunity,” Norris told Canary Media. ​“It just has such substantial implications for affordability and reliability.”

Clean, cheap, quick

Even if Norris’ calculations bear out, Duke Energy’s projections show it will need hundreds more megawatts of power capacity in the next decade for large loads alone. And for AI data centers, the quicker the better: In Virginia, the world’s data center capital, construction of the facilities takes 18 months or less.

That’s where utility-scale solar and storage could be especially useful, said Burns. ​“Not only are the resources of our members clean,” he added, ​“they’re also less expensive and quicker to market.”

A June report from global investment firm Lazard concludes that land-based wind turbines and large solar farms ​“remain the most cost-effective forms of new-build energy generation on an unsubsidized basis.”

By contrast, Lazard says, ​“the cost of building a new combined cycle gas turbine has reached a 10-year high. Turbine shortages, rising costs, and long delivery times are expected to continue driving steep [levelized cost of energy] increases for gas technologies in the near term.”

The North Carolina Department of Commerce has adopted Gov. Stein’s ​“all-of-the-above energy deployment approach,” said Jennifer Mundt, the agency’s assistant secretary for energy and infrastructure. But renewables align with the department’s economic development mission because nearly half of all Fortune 500 companies aim to reach net-zero emissions by 2050, Mundt wrote in her letter to utility commissioners. ​“Companies are prioritizing sites with access to diverse energy sources,” she noted, as well as those with affordable, reliable electricity.

Especially after the legislature repealed a key target for emissions reductions this summer, many tech giants now have more aggressive clean energy goals than the state. Amazon has pledged net-zero carbon emissions across its global operations by 2040. Google aims to power its data centers with 24/7 carbon-free energy by 2030.

“Google leadership remains firmly committed to this goal,” the company said in its comments to regulators, ​“making it critical that we are able to identify viable pathways to supporting new carbon-free energy resources as we continue to grow our business.”

A best-case scenario for the clean energy transition?

In their comments to regulators, experts highlight a range of policies that would help data center growth align with — rather than contravene — the clean energy transition.

A voluntary ​“clean transition tariff,” for instance, would allow data centers to pay for new renewables to come online, rather than just chip in for carbon-free energy already in the works. In Nevada, Google partnered with utility NV Energy on such a scheme, which will enable 115 megawatts of around-the-clock geothermal power to supply the company’s data centers.

North Carolina regulators could consider inducements for so-called ​“energy parks,” where data centers and other large loads would be clustered around their new energy sources, reducing interconnection delays and the need for transmission upgrades. The on-site energy generation could increase the resilience of the grid as a whole, serving as backup power for the utility.

Indeed, ​“virtual” or ​“distributed” power plants, whereby utilities can access non-centralized energy resources during times of need, could help avoid the construction of new power plants, saving utilities and their customers billions of dollars.

The practice is already being tested elsewhere in the U.S. Black Hills Energy negotiated a contract with Microsoft that allows the utility to tap backup generation at the tech company’s Cheyenne, Wyoming, data center during periods of high electricity demand.

For Jimenez of the Southern Environmental Law Center, the best-case scenario is that the regulators adopt these and other policies suggested by advocates, such that ​“the large load that comes to the state pays for its own clean generation, and the rest of us don’t pay excessive bills.”

Of course, doing nothing is a distinct possibility. Like all investor-owned, monopoly utilities, Duke is financially motivated to invest in as many capital assets as possible, to be paid back with interest by captive customers. Though it was overridden, the utility opposed the Southern Environmental Law Center’s original request for a technical conference.

In September comments to the commission, Duke said there is ​“no need to rush into major changes” or ​“any paradigm shift.” It pointedly argued against reforms that might take place outside a general rate case or the long-term planning process. It acknowledged the risk of building new power plants that may not be used fully by large loads, but asserted that existing regulatory processes and other factors assure that in the short-term, ​“there is more than ample protection against investment in generation assets that are not needed.”

What’s more, it bodes ill that last year’s much-vaunted agreement between Duke and data center giants to develop a clean transition tariff in the Carolinas appears to have fizzled: Despite promises otherwise, the utility has yet to request such a tariff.

But Duke’s September comments did offer a few rays of hope for advocates. Load flexibility, it suggested, is no panacea, but the company acknowledged that ​“well-structured flexible operations can provide benefits for customers.”

On virtual power plants, the company said it is ​“open to all ideas that could provide benefits to the system as a whole and are compliant with applicable law. … Creative engagement around such ideas is essential.”

Meanwhile, the commission’s perspective may be in flux. Unlike the panel that opened the docket in June, a majority of the body’s members are now appointed by Republicans, and it has elected a new chair. How regulators engage in this debate will become clearer when experts gather in October.",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/GettyImages-143135053.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=94746d0a1d259787a1a1ccbd2a52fd8d,N,,2025-09-16 04:00:04.590007

With ambitious renewable energy targets, domestic solar cell manufacturing has become a strategic necessity. Integrated Batteries India’s facility will serve as an example of how private sector investment and government support can drive sustainable growth.

The project also complements India’s broader goals under the Atmanirbhar Bharat initiative, which emphasizes reducing import dependence and building local capabilities. By producing solar cells domestically, the country can better manage supply chain risks, reduce costs, and improve the competitiveness of its solar energy projects on a global scale.

Additionally, the facility is expected to adopt modern and energy-efficient manufacturing practices. This will not only reduce the carbon footprint of production but also improve the quality and durability of the solar cells. By ensuring high-quality output, the plant could also open export opportunities for Indian solar products in international markets.

For Integrated Batteries India, this venture represents a major step toward becoming a key player in the renewable energy space. The company’s commitment to investing in large-scale solar manufacturing underscores the increasing confidence of private companies in India’s clean energy future. Their expansion will likely inspire other players to invest in similar ventures.

With YEIDA’s support and India’s growing focus on renewables, the new solar cell facility could become a cornerstone project for the sector. By combining policy backing, land availability, and private investment, the initiative reflects the collaborative approach needed for the clean energy transition. The 4 GW facility will stand as a symbol of India’s solar ambitions.",https://www.eqmagpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/cropped-eq-logo-32x32.png,N,,2025-09-15 23:59:51.055186

Navigating this period of uncertainty presents substantial challenges across the EV value chain, yet strategic foresight and planning can enable successful adaptation.
Both new EV companies and established OEMs now face major challenges.
Charting the Path Forward for the Road Ahead The EV market has progressed through distinct phases.","The pillars supporting the U.S. electric vehicle (“EV”) sector are facing significant strain. Financial incentives, including subsidies and tax credits, have been repealed, while long-standing fuel economy and emissions standards are being reconsidered and redirected toward alternative priorities. Policy volatility, including on-and-off again tariffs and the removal of incentives, is undermining the stability needed for strategic planning. In a short period of time, the discourse has shifted from scaling the EV supply chain to fundamental questions about the sector’s viability. Navigating this period of uncertainty presents substantial challenges across the EV value chain, yet strategic foresight and planning can enable successful adaptation.

Reflections From the Road Traveled

For over a decade, the world’s three largest automotive markets (i.e., China, Europe, United States) have promoted electrification through a dual-pronged approach — incentives to encourage EV adoption (“the carrot”) and regulatory measures to constrain internal combustion engine (“ICE”) vehicle usage (“the stick”). In the United States, this framework has historically meant subsidies to support domestic EV manufacturing and, more recently, consumer tax credits for EV purchases.1 Complementing these incentives have been stringent fuel economy and emissions standards designed to gradually phase out ICE vehicles.2 The passage of the Inflation Reduction Act (“IRA”), along with the latest fuel economy regulations issued by the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), significantly bolstered this policy landscape.3,4

As a result, the first quarter of 2025 showed strong EV market growth, with sales increasing approximately 11% year-over-year, or roughly 10% of total new vehicle sales in Q1 2025. Notably, this coincided with Tesla’s market share declining to about 43% from over 50% in the previous year, signaling a more diversified and maturing EV market ecosystem.5

Hitting the Brakes

The U.S. faces a pivotal moment as both incentives and regulations driving electrification are under threat. Weakening tax credits, renewed challenges to longstanding emissions rules, and volatile tariff policies collectively jeopardize the long-term stability and momentum of the EV transition.

Two key regulatory agencies — the EPA and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (“NHTSA”) — have traditionally anchored U.S. fuel economy policy around carbon dioxide (“CO2”)-based emissions standards. These greenhouse gas (“GHG”) regulations have served as the principal mechanism incentivizing legacy automakers to invest in and commercialize electric vehicles. However, under the current administration, both agencies have begun shifting their regulatory focus from GHGs to hazardous air pollutants,6 a subtle yet consequential change. Unlike hazardous pollutants, CO2 is not directly harmful to human health in ambient concentrations but remains the primary ICE emission driving climate change. By deprioritizing CO2 in favor of hazardous emissions, the administration is reducing the emphasis on fuel economy and climate- focused standards and shifting the focus to public health.

The Biden administration established formal fleet fuel economy as well as CO2 reduction targets through 2032. The penalties for not meeting the fuel economy standards have now been set to zero and the EPA has planned to reveal more permissive standards for CO2.7 This regulatory instability is complicating long-term planning, making it more difficult for original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) to commit to investment strategies and future product development.

On the incentive front, the IRA was designed to reduce the cost of EV production and ownership, while simultaneously strengthening the domestic supply chain. Key provisions included a $7,500 consumer tax credit for qualifying EV purchases, as well as manufacturing incentives. The IRA also had measures to subsidize EV charging infrastructure, notably mandating the deployment of EV chargers along major national highway corridors.8

Under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (“OBBB”), the EV charging infrastructure incentives are being sunset by June 2026 and the EV purchase credits by September 2025 — several years ahead of the IRA’s original 2032 end date. It is expected that there will be a temporary surge in EV sales leading up to the September expiration, followed by a decline in sales in Q4 2025. This accelerated timeline is likely to significantly reduce consumer demand, particularly for mass-market and used EVs, which have relied heavily on these incentives to remain competitive with traditional vehicles. The removal of the Qualified Commercial Clean Vehicles Credit further delays fleet electrification, impacting commercial EV manufacturers and infrastructure providers.9

Further complicating the policy landscape, on April 2, 2025, the administration introduced a new wave of tariffs, imposing a 145% duty on Chinese EVs and battery materials in an effort to reduce U.S. dependency on China, which currently controls over 70% of global battery and cell production and over 85% of cathode and anode capacity. Tariffs, primarily used as short-term negotiation tools, undermine predictability and complicate long-term capital commitments. Within weeks, tariff policy specifically toward China shifted repeatedly, including a temporary 90-day pause and subsequent rate adjustments, creating prolonged uncertainty around tariff levels and significantly complicating long-term capital planning.10

The combined effect of recent policy and regulatory changes, along with an increasingly protectionist tariff environment, is expected to substantially impact EV adoption in the United States. Consumer demand for both passenger and commercial EVs is likely to decline, and private-sector investment in EV charging infrastructure is anticipated to contract significantly. Automakers may scale back their EV deployment strategies in favor of higher-margin ICE vehicles, further weakening America’s competitive position in a rapidly growing global market. The effects are already evident, with EV sales flattening in Q2 2025 (see figure 1). Given the current policy environment, FTI has revised its forecast for U.S. EV adoption to below 30% by 2035, down from a 60% penetration forecasted just one year ago.11 Companies founded on expectations of sustained growth now face unpredictable regulatory shifts that outpace their capacity to adapt supply chains and strategic plans, creating persistent uncertainty over long-term strategic planning. Absent corrective measures, this could result in the U.S. falling behind other regions (particularly China and Europe) that continue to aggressively support electrification and battery manufacturing, resulting in economic and strategic disadvantages.

Figure 1 - US Quarterly EV Sales (000) (2023-2025)

Shifting Gears

This is not merely short-term turbulence, the current environment presents deeper structural uncertainty that is now amplified by the OBBB. The termination of key incentives and weakening of regulatory enforcement mechanisms are placing pressure on the sector and eroding investor confidence, complicating long-term strategic planning across the EV ecosystem. Both new EV companies and established OEMs now face major challenges. Extended planning cycles have been disrupted, likely compelling companies to re-evaluate fundamental business assumptions and potentially slowing innovation, investment and deployment strategies, thus diminishing America’s global competitive advantage in the EV sector.

For the wave of new companies that were inspired by Tesla’s success and the broader promise of electrification, a breakdown in the foundational assumptions underpinning their business models (i.e., strong policy support and market growth for several years) could lead to restructurings, market consolidation and increased risks of outright failures.

For more established players, such as legacy automakers and Tier 1 suppliers, this uncertainty has thrown long-term investment strategies into disarray. General Motors, for example, publicly committed to phasing out its entire ICE portfolio.13

This bold move was echoed by several other OEMs who have redirected the majority of their R&D budgets toward battery-electric and autonomous vehicle technologies.14,15 These commitments are typically aligned with six-year regulatory cycles and twelve-year capital investment horizons. Frequent reversals in federal policy significantly undermine such extended planning, impairing investor confidence, stalling momentum and diminishing the nation’s future competitive edge in the global EV marketplace.

What You Can Do To Steer Through the Uncertainty

Managing Cash To Enhance Liquidity Management

Periods of heightened uncertainty, delayed product launches or reduced sales significantly impact cash flow, elevating the importance of disciplined liquidity management. Robust cash forecasting can offer critical visibility into short-term financial needs. Identifying levers for unlocking near-term liquidity can significantly enhance financial resilience. Raising additional capital or modifying existing debt instruments may be required to enhance short- to medium-term liquidity. Equally important is preserving strategic optionality, allowing businesses to extend their operational runway and adapt quickly as trade policies and market dynamics continue to shift. Companies can also proactively manage working capital by optimizing inventory levels and accounts receivable terms, ensuring alignment with shifting market realities.

Getting Lean To Optimize Operational Efficiency

Management teams can comprehensively evaluate their organizational structure, resource allocation and core operational processes to strengthen resilience amid persistent uncertainty. This involves evaluating spans of control, identifying redundant roles and addressing underperforming business units to improve efficiency and profitability. Companies can also prioritize digital transformation and AI initiatives and operational analytics to gain deeper insights into performance metrics and streamline decision-making processes.

Ultimately, businesses should clearly define their core competencies, leverage data-driven insights and concentrate resources on operations with clear pathways to profitability and growth to effectively navigate challenging market conditions.

Seize on Strategic Opportunities During Market Consolidation

If a market consolidation phase materializes, companies possessing high-quality assets but lacking sufficient liquidity or financial backing may be compelled to pursue divestitures in order to maintain solvency. Industry participants with strong balance sheets and access to capital can leverage this environment to pursue compelling opportunities to acquire strategic assets. Additionally, companies should remain agile and actively monitor market dynamics to rapidly capitalize on partnership opportunities or alliances that can enhance their competitive positioning and accelerate strategic objectives.

Charting the Path Forward for the Road Ahead

The EV market has progressed through distinct phases. In the early 2010s, EVs remained a niche product, often met with skepticism. Global momentum accelerated as China’s aggressive policy push and Tesla’s early breakthroughs spurred adoption. The COVID-19 era brought unprecedented regulatory and financial support, lowering costs, improving product quality and driving large-scale investment from global automakers. Today, however, the U.S. EV sector faces significant headwinds. Policy reversals threaten to slow progress, while a surge of lower-cost Chinese EV exports is intensifying competitive pressure on OEMs worldwide. These forces are straining the EV ecosystem and could trigger consolidation and market exits in the years ahead.

Despite these setbacks, underlying technological advancements and broader global market trends continue to strongly favor electrification in the long term. We believe that companies must maintain investment in innovation, particularly in battery chemistries, charging technology and integration with renewable energy grids to ensure readiness for the eventual market recovery. Amid escalating headwinds, the question for industry participants is clear: not merely who is best positioned today, but who possesses the resilience required to stay the course and emerge in a stronger position once the storm passes.

“This Administration is shamelessly working to block one of our best defenses against rising energy bills: renewable energy.
Padilla further emphasized that by investing in older fossil fuel plants, the Administration will continue to raise energy costs and cede global leadership in renewable energy production and innovation to adversaries like China.
Our solution has to be a more inclusive approach to energy portfolios.” Padilla concluded by outlining his vision for a more efficient, lower-cost, and reliable clean energy future.","WASHINGTON, D.C. — Today, U.S. Senator Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), a member of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, spoke on the Senate floor to outline the Trump Administration’s devastating cuts to clean energy projects across the country that are leading to significant energy cost increases for American families. He contrasted Trump’s shortsighted actions against renewable energy with California’s leadership in building a reliable grid and clean energy economy.

Padilla emphasized that Trump has gone back on his promises to cut energy costs, as energy prices are now rising twice as fast as inflation. In the face of rising prices, California state lawmakers passed a legislative package this weekend to strengthen the state’s energy portfolio and lower the cost of living for working families. The package will help increase the supply of energy Californians rely on while facilitating coordination with counterparts in states like Oregon and Washington to create a regional electric grid across the Western United States.

While Republicans claim that renewable energy isn’t affordable or dependable, Padilla stressed that solar and wind power are cheaper than both coal and natural gas, with solar power costing only half as much as coal. He highlighted that California’s historic economic growth across industries demonstrates the promise of a sustainable, clean energy future. In 2023, clean energy made up two thirds of California’s retail electricity. At the same time, the state’s grid has become more reliable as battery capacity in California has expanded by nearly 2,000% since 2019.

“This Administration is shamelessly working to block one of our best defenses against rising energy bills: renewable energy. And I say so because renewable energy is absolutely affordable, renewable energy is abundant, and whether you want to admit it or not, renewable energy sources are our future.”

“[California is] harnessing the power of solar and wind and hydroelectric power and nuclear, geothermal, even hydrogen power to our state. And it’s exactly because of those investments that even in a year like 2024, just last year, when we experienced record heat waves that we also saw record renewable energy generation, and we kept the lights on.”

“We know that with a growing population and a growing economy, including, but not limited to, the future of an AI boom, demand will continue to grow. But we’re committed to the kind of inclusive portfolio of energy options that has made our grid more reliable.”

Despite California’s leadership, the Trump Administration has decimated clean energy efforts, cutting historic tax credits from the Inflation Reduction Act, canceling offshore wind projects, and withholding funding from solar projects that lower energy bills and create good-paying jobs. According to Climate Power, since Trump was elected, over 120 clean energy projects across the country have been canceled or delayed or are laying off staff, amounting to nearly 14,000 megawatts taken off the grid — enough to power over 8.4 million homes. Padilla further emphasized that by investing in older fossil fuel plants, the Administration will continue to raise energy costs and cede global leadership in renewable energy production and innovation to adversaries like China.

Padilla underscored that Trump’s dependence on fossil fuels will exacerbate the climate crisis and lead to more intense natural disasters, including drought, atmospheric rivers, and catastrophic wildfires like Los Angeles experienced in January. As President Trump has baselessly attacked California’s wildfire policy and withheld disaster aid for California, Senator Padilla highlighted his previous work to pass the FIRE Act to help FEMA better prepare for and respond to wildfires, his efforts to finalize the transfer of seven C-130s from the Coast Guard to California to retrofit for fighting wildfires, and his ongoing bipartisan push to pass the Fix Our Forests Act to combat devastating wildfires, restore forest ecosystems, and make federal forest management more efficient and responsive.

“[Trump’s reliance on fossil fuels] is not just bad for consumers, it’s not just bad for reliability — it’s literally putting lives at risk.”

“It’s no surprise that Donald Trump loves to attack California’s leaders for wildfire policy and our climate leadership, and we also know he loves to play politics with disaster funding. That record is clear. Yet he continues to dig us deeper and deeper into an energy policy that actually increases the risk of the next great disaster. And Californians will be left to clean up the mess.”

“Reliance on fossil fuels comes at a cost, and Americans, not just Californians, but Americans are paying for it in the form of higher energy bills and in lives destroyed after these major disasters. So no matter how many times Trump says it, we can never and will never ‘Drill, Baby, Drill’ our way to cheaper energy costs. Our solution has to be a more inclusive approach to energy portfolios.”

Padilla concluded by outlining his vision for a more efficient, lower-cost, and reliable clean energy future. He pushed for streamlining the approval and completion of energy projects while building out our transmission system and fostering regional cooperation to strengthen the grid.

“That’s how we meet our growing demand — more options, not less, more cooperation, not less, and more sources of energy, not less.”

“Trump might continue to lie to the American people about renewable energy, but Americans know that this energy crisis doesn’t have to continue forever, and California is proud to show the way forward.”

In the wake of the pending closures, the California Energy Commission sent Newsom a series of recommendations to bolster stability to the petroleum market.
But a coalition of environmental groups decried SB 237, saying it runs counter to the state’s clean energy goals.
Those provisions and others, SB 254’s supporters say, can help reduce monthly electric bills for customers across the state.","Over the weekend, lawmakers in Sacramento passed a suite of energy-related bills pushed by Gov. Gavin Newsom that came forward in the final days of the California legislative session.

The measures that extended proceedings into Saturday include legislation that clears the way for California to join a regional electric grid, tries to boost statewide oil production in the wake of a pair of looming refinery shutdowns, extends California’s cap-and-trade program and replenishes the state’s wildfire funds.

The bills head to now head to the governor’s office, where Newsom has until Oct. 13 to sign them into law.

By all indications, that will be a mere formality.

“After months of hard work with the Legislature, we have agreed to historic reforms that will save money on your electric bills, stabilize gas supply, and slash toxic air pollution — all while fast-tracking California’s transition to a clean, green job-creating economy,” Newsom said when the raft of last-minute bills were introduced.

Assembly Bill 825, originally known as Senate Bill 540, will enable California to join a new energy trading market with other states in the West. By more easily tapping into power in the region, the bill’s supporters say it will lead to lower energy costs for consumers and more seamlessly integrate power supplies.

The California Independent System Operator that manages the electric grid for about 80% of the state, took to social media and hailed the bill’s passage as “a major milestone for the West” that was “shaped by years of successful and evolving regional collaboration.”

AB 825 passed 34-0 in the Senate on Friday and 74-1 in the Assembly on Saturday.

But critics worry that joining a regional grid with other states that don’t all share California’s decarbonization goals could link the Golden State with those like Wyoming that use coal-fired power plants.

“This concerns us because the federal government has recently forced customers in other regional markets to pay increased costs to prop up fossil (fuel) generation facilities at risk of retirement,” Lee Trotman, communications director for The Utility Reform Network, known as TURN, said in an email. “TURN asks each policymaker to do everything you can to make sure, that TURN’s warnings about AB 825 never come to pass.”

Boosting in-state oil

Senate Bill 237, which also zoomed through the Legislature with large bipartisan support, passed amid worries that California’s already high gasoline prices may climb even higher.

Phillips 66 plans to shut down its twin refineries in Carson and Wilmington by the end of this year and Valero recently gave notice it will shut down operations at its refinery in the Northern California city of Benicia by 2026. The Valero and Phillips 66 facilities combine to account for roughly 18% of the state’s crude oil capacity.

In the wake of the pending closures, the California Energy Commission sent Newsom a series of recommendations to bolster stability to the petroleum market.

SB 237 includes provisions aimed at increasing crude oil production in the state, particularly in the Bakersfield area where the largest concentration of derricks are located.

“This legislation will protect consumers from supply disruptions, provide investor confidence in the state’s energy sector and ensure Kern County continues to lead with both environmental responsibility and energy reliability,” the Kern County Board of Supervisors said in a statement.

But a coalition of environmental groups decried SB 237, saying it runs counter to the state’s clean energy goals.

“More in-state drilling will not prevent inevitable refinery closures or guarantee lower gas prices,” said the group that included Sierra Club California, the Natural Resources Defense Council and California Environmental Voters. “Additional permits will not change the fact that California oil fields are in decline, nearly completely depleted, but will worsen racial and climate injustice.

Keeping cap and trade going

Since 2013, California participates in a cap-and-trade program that requires power plants, natural gas providers and large industries that emit greenhouse gases to buy permits on the carbon pollution they produce.

The Legislature over the weekend passed Assembly Bill 1207, which extends the program for the next 20 years, and Senate Bill 840 that will distribute the estimated $60 billion to $90 billion of revenue among various air, water and fire prevention programs aimed at reducing emissions.

The legislation also earmarks $20 billion that will go to the state’s controversial and expensive high-speed rail project.

“By aligning the future of cap and trade with the timeline of California’s ambitious emission reduction targets, California is positioned to achieve its climate goals in the most cost-effective way possible,” said Katelyn Roedner Sutter, California state director of the Environmental Defense Fund.

AB 1207 renames the cap-and trade program as the California Cap-And-Invest Program.

Despite the passage of AB 1207 and SB 840, a large number of Republicans voted against the two bills, with some complaining about the lack of funding for agricultural projects in the program.

Wildfires and utilities

A wide-ranging piece of legislation, Senate Bill 254 raises $18 billion to shore up the state’s Wildfire Fund, which some worry will get depleted after January’s deadly fires in the Los Angeles area.

Under SB 254, the state’s big investor-owned utilities (including San Diego Gas & Electric) would combine to pay for half of the $18 billion total while electricity customers across California would pay the other $9 billion over a 10-year period.

The bill also creates low-interest loans to cover the construction of new transmission lines and prohibits utilities from earning a rate of return on the first $6 billion they spend on their upgrades on wildfire prevention.

Those provisions and others, SB 254’s supporters say, can help reduce monthly electric bills for customers across the state.

“There are pieces that some of us like and some of us don’t,” Sen. Aisha Wahab, D-Fremont, told Politico, “but this is a very large collaboration.”

This development will be supported by an average annual growth rate of 8 %, driven by favourable national policies, increasing grid stability needs and the expansion of renewable energy.

Chile leads regional installations

Chile will account for nearly half of the installed capacity in the region by that time, confirming its leading role in the energy storage sector. The country relies on an advanced regulatory framework that structures investment around large-scale projects. Mexico and the Dominican Republic complete the top three. Despite strong potential, Mexico is facing regulatory hurdles, while the Dominican Republic is showing rapid sectoral growth.

Utility-scale projects dominate

Utility-scale installations will overwhelmingly dominate the market. In Central America and the Caribbean, these projects are mostly standalone and aim to stabilise the grid. In contrast, countries in South America and Mexico are focusing on solar-paired systems, driven by high photovoltaic penetration. The commercial and industrial segment could gradually emerge in some countries from the mid-2030s.

Climate targets and tenders as drivers

National renewable energy targets and rising curtailment levels are pushing governments to integrate storage into their energy planning. Regional tenders have proven effective in driving projects, notably through the adoption of Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS). Several countries have already included long-term storage targets in their national plans.

Structural challenges remain

Despite growth prospects, the absence of comprehensive regulatory frameworks hampers BESS deployment. The lack of operational models and remuneration mechanisms for each market segment is slowing the structuring of the sector. In addition, high upfront costs persist in some markets, although they are expected to decline with the entry of new players.

One such avenue is the monetization of tax credits, particularly the Investment Tax Credit (ITC), which has long been a cornerstone of U.S. renewable energy policy. However, recent inquiries into Opal Fuels' strategies—specifically, its purported use of “IRA Investment Tax Credits”—reveal a critical ambiguity in terminology and practice that merits closer examination.

The IRA-ITC Confusion: A Taxonomy of Terms

The confusion stems from the dual meanings of “IRA.” While the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022 has expanded tax incentives for clean energy projectsIndividual retirement arrangements (IRAs) | Internal Revenue Service[ 1 ], the acronym is also widely associated with Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs), which are tax-advantaged savings vehicles for individualsIndividual Retirement Account (IRA): What It Is, 4 Types[ 2 ]. Crucially, the IRS does not link IRAs to ITCs for sustainable energy projectsIndividual retirement arrangements (IRAs) | Internal Revenue Service[ 3 ]. This semantic misalignment highlights a broader challenge: companies and investors must navigate a complex regulatory framework where terms like “IRA” can obscure rather than clarify opportunities.

For context, traditional ITCs for renewable energy—such as those for solar, wind, and geothermal projects—are distinct from IRA retirement accounts. These credits, which reduce a company's tax liability in proportion to its investment in qualifying projects, have been instrumental in scaling clean energy infrastructureWhich IRA is right for you? Different types of IRA accounts[ 4 ]. The Inflation Reduction Act has further enhanced these incentives, extending and expanding ITC eligibility to a broader range of technologies and projectsIndividual Retirement Account (IRA): Types, How It Works[ 5 ].

Industry Practices: Monetizing ITCs for ESG-Aligned Capital Deployment

While Opal Fuels' specific strategies remain opaque, industry practices offer a blueprint for how companies might leverage ITCs to fund sustainable energy projects. The process typically involves three stages:

1. Project Development: Companies identify qualifying projects (e.g., solar farms, energy storage systems) under the ITC framework.

2. Credit Allocation: Tax credits are either retained to reduce corporate tax burdens or sold to third parties (e.g., banks, institutional investors) via tax equity partnershipsIndividual retirement arrangements (IRAs) | Internal Revenue Service[ 6 ].

3. ESG Integration: Proceeds from credit monetization are reinvested into ESG-aligned initiatives, such as community resilience programs or carbon capture technologies.

This model has proven particularly effective in sectors where upfront capital costs are high but long-term environmental benefits are substantial. For instance, data from BloombergNEF indicates that tax equity financing accounted for over 40% of U.S. solar project funding in 2024, underscoring its role in de-risking clean energy investments.

The ESG Imperative: Aligning Profit and Purpose

The strategic monetization of ITCs is not merely a financial tactic but a tool for advancing ESG goals. By converting tax credits into liquidity, companies can fund projects that reduce greenhouse gas emissions, enhance energy access, and create local jobs—all while maintaining profitability. This dual benefit is especially critical as institutional investors increasingly demand transparency in ESG reporting and impact measurement.

However, challenges persist. The Inflation Reduction Act's expanded incentives have also intensified competition for limited tax equity capital, driving up the cost of credit sales. Additionally, regulatory uncertainties—such as potential changes to ITC eligibility criteria—require companies to adopt agile, forward-looking strategies.

Conclusion: A Path Forward for Sustainable Capital Deployment

While Opal Fuels' role in this ecosystem remains undefined, the broader industry's approach to ITC monetization offers valuable lessons. For companies seeking to balance financial and environmental objectives, the key lies in leveraging tax incentives as a bridge between capital efficiency and ESG alignment. As the clean energy transition accelerates, the ability to navigate these incentives will distinguish market leaders from laggards.",https://lh-prod-oper-pub-opercenter.s3.amazonaws.com/discovery-image/compress-19bd27fae8d38001.png,N,,2025-09-16 00:00:14.549923

Still, the state remains the nation’s most reliant on coal to generate electricity, and coal is a major source of CO2.

The state’s coal fleet operates less frequently than it did 20 years ago, and some coal plants have closed in that time.

“I am not looking into any federal grants.","President Donald Trump’s efforts to stamp out his predecessor’s climate legacy are making some nonprofits and local governments wary of relying on Uncle Sam.

Since Trump took office, his administration has clawed back billions of dollars in federal grants, leaving climate and resiliency projects in the lurch and casting doubt on whether promises of funding from the federal government are as dependable as they once were, writes my colleague Alex Guillén.

The tiny village of Kipnuk, Alaska, for example, suddenly lost a $20 million grant to build a rock wall and take other steps to stop homes from falling into a river. In Mississippi, a nonprofit saw two grants terminated: $500,000 to turn dilapidated housing lots into community parks and $20 million for a solar-powered hurricane shelter.

With cash abruptly stripped away, local governments and organizations have been scrambling for other ways to fund these projects. The experience has left them feeling dismayed at federal agencies that had long been a reliable source of support.

“My mind was like, how could they terminate the grant, even when we did not do anything wrong?” Rayna Paul, Kipnuk’s environmental director, told Alex.

Federal agencies have long been critical in supporting resiliency projects in small communities across the country, but former President Joe Biden’s 2022 climate law opened the door for larger projects to be funded wholly by the U.S. government. That meant less cobbling together of funding from various donors or benefactors.

But now that money is gone. And while some groups have sued over the reneged grants, some federal courts are siding with the Trump administration, taking the lead of the Supreme Court.

Applying for federal awards can be both tedious and time consuming. If federal grants are now also unreliable, some recipients doubt they will seek support from Washington in the future.

“I am not looking into any federal grants. The risk is way too high, and the effort is way too large,” said Dominika Parry, with the nonprofit 2°C Mississippi, which spent 10 months working with the Environmental Protection Agency on its grant application to make microparks out of home lots.

For larger nonprofits, grant cuts have been major disappointments but not dire.

GRID Alternatives, a California nonprofit with a staff of roughly 500, will likely scale back its ambitions after it lost more than $300 million in federal grants to expand its work funding solar projects on low-income housing and tribal lands.

At smaller groups, the cuts have been more damaging. Parry has started to work without pay to cut costs. She said The Hartford, the Connecticut-based insurance company that provides 2°C with basic general liability coverage, also told her recently that it will not renew the nonprofit’s policy. The reason: insuring environmental groups is too risky.

Sierra Club gets new leader

The Sierra Club has a new boss after years of internal turbulence and leadership drama, writes Robin Bravender.

The environmental group’s board unanimously voted Saturday to hire Loren Blackford as executive director. Blackford has been a leader at the Sierra Club for nearly two decades, including serving as deputy executive director, as president and as the Sierra Club Foundation board chair.

The move comes after the board fired Ben Jealous from the executive director position in August “for cause” following “extensive evaluation of his conduct.”

Jealous was the subject of a sexual harassment complaint earlier this year, a person familiar with the details of the complaint told POLITICO’s E&E News. Jealous, the former head of the NAACP and the Sierra Club’s first Black leader, said he faced discrimination and a campaign against him during his time leading the group.

Hurricanes, with a side of measles?

Florida’s plans to scrap its vaccine requirements could increase the risk of disease outbreaks during future hurricane seasons, writes Ariel Wittenberg.

The state’s surgeon general announced this month that Florida’s Department of Health would begin the process of allowing people to opt out of vaccine mandates for “personal health benefits.” Public health experts worry that the policy could make matters worse during future hurricane seasons, as climate change fuels stronger storms in the Atlantic.

“Something like measles is so infectious, it would go through a hurricane shelter like wildfire,” said Katie Huffling, executive director for the Alliance of Nurses for Healthy Environments.

Long road ahead for Alaska LNG

The lead developer of Alaska LNG touted new deals last week, but the mammoth liquefied natural gas project remains far from the finish line, writes Carlos Anchondo.

The project aims to build a natural gas pipeline across the state, along with an export terminal. Majority owner Glenfarne Group unveiled two new partnerships last week — one with JERA, Japan’s largest power generation company, and another with POSCO International, a South Korean trading and investment company.

The project also has the support of the Trump administration, with Energy Secretary Chris Wright calling it “one of the greatest energy infrastructure projects in our nation’s history.” But Alaska has been trying to build a gas pipeline for decades, and it’s no small feat.

“It’s a tall order and it’s an expensive order,” said Brigham McCown, a senior fellow and director of the Initiative on American Energy Security at the Hudson Institute.

Texas moved first, as state lawmakers try to protect residents in the data-center hotspot from another deadly blackout, like the winter storm in 2021 when dozens died.

Now the concept is emerging in the 13-state mid-Atlantic grid and elsewhere as massive data centers are coming online faster than power plants can be built and connected to grids. That has elicited pushback from data centers and Big Tech, for whom a steady power supply is vital.

Like many other states, Texas wants to attract data centers as an economic boon, but it faces the challenge of meeting the huge volumes of electricity the centers demand. Lawmakers there passed a bill in June that, among other things, orders up standards for power emergencies when utilities must disconnect big electric users.

That, in theory, would save enough electricity to avoid a broad blackout on the handful of days during the year when it is hottest or coldest and power consumption pushes grids to their limits or beyond.

Texas was first, but it won’t be the last, analysts say, now that the late 2022 debut of OpenAI’s ChatGPT ignited worldwide demand for chatbots and other generative AI products that typically require large amounts of computing power to train and operate.

“We’re going to see that kind of thing pop up everywhere,” said Michael Webber, a University of Texas engineering professor who specializes in energy. “Data center flexibility will be expected, required, encouraged, mandated, whatever it is.”

Data centers are threatening grids

That’s because grids can’t keep up with the fast-growing number of data center projects unfolding in Texas and perhaps 20 other states as the U.S. competes in a race against China for artificial intelligence superiority.

Grid operators in Texas, the Great Plains states and the mid-Atlantic region have produced eye-popping projections showing that electricity demand in the coming years will spike, largely due to data centers.

A proposal similar to Texas’ has emerged from the nation’s biggest grid operator, PJM Interconnection, which runs the mid-Atlantic grid that serves 65 million people and data-center hotspots in Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania.

The CEO of the Southwest Power Pool, which operates the grid that serves 18 million people primarily in Kansas, Oklahoma and other Great Plains states, said it has no choice but to expand power-reduction programs — likely for the biggest power users — to meet growing demand.

The proposals are cropping up at a time when electricity bills nationally are rising fast — twice the rate of inflation, according to federal data — and growing evidence suggests that the bills of some regular Americans are rising to subsidize the gargantuan energy needs of Big Tech.

Analysts say power plant construction cannot keep up with the growth of data center demand, and that something must change.

“Data center load has the potential to overwhelm the grid, and I think it is on its way to doing that,” said Joe Bowring, who heads Monitoring Analytics, the independent market watchdog in the mid-Atlantic grid.

Data centers might have to adjust

Big Tech is trying to make their data centers more energy efficient. They are also installing backup generators, typically fueled by diesel, to ensure an uninterrupted power supply if there’s a power outage.

Data center operators, however, say they hadn’t anticipated needing that backup power supply to help grid operators meet demand and are closely watching how utility regulators in Texas write the regulations.

The Data Center Coalition, which represents Big Tech companies and data center developers, wants the standards to be flexible, since some data centers may not be able to switch to backup power as easily or as quickly as others.

The grid operator also should balance that system with financial rewards for data centers that voluntarily shut down during emergencies, said Dan Diorio of the Data Center Coalition.

Nation’s largest grid operator has a proposal

PJM’s just-released proposal revolves around a concept in which proposed data centers may not be guaranteed to receive electricity during a power emergency.

That’s caused a stir among power plant owners and the tech industry.

Many questioned PJM’s legal authority to enforce it or warned of destabilizing energy markets and states scaring off investors and developers with uncertainty and risk.

“This is particularly concerning given that states within PJM’s footprint actively compete with other U.S. regions for data center and digital infrastructure investment,” the Digital Power Network, a group of Bitcoin miners and data center developers, said in written comments to PJM.

The governors of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Illinois and Maryland said they worried that it’s too unpredictable to provide a permanent solution and that it should at least be accompanied by incentives for data centers to build new power sources and voluntarily reduce electricity use.

Others, including consumer advocates, warned that it won’t lower electric bills and that PJM should instead pursue a “bring your own generation” requirement for data centers to, in essence, build their own power source.

A deal is shrouded in secrecy

In Indiana, Google took a voluntary route.

Last month, the electric utility, Indiana & Michigan Power, and the tech giant filed a power-supply contract with Indiana regulators for a proposed $2 billion data center planned in Fort Wayne in which Google agreed to reduce electricity use there when the grid is stressed. The data center would, it said, reduce electricity use by delaying non-urgent tasks to when the electric grid is under less stress.

However, important details are being kept from the public and Ben Inskeep of the Citizens Action Coalition, a consumer advocacy group, said that leaves it unclear how valuable the arrangement really is, if at all.

A new way of thinking about electricity

To an extent, bumping big users off the grid during high-demand periods presents a new approach to electricity.

It could save money for regular ratepayers, since power is most expensive during peak usage periods.

Abe Silverman, an energy researcher at Johns Hopkins University, said that data centers can and do use all the electricity they want on most days.

But taking data centers off the grid for those handful of hours during the most extreme heat or cold would mean not having to spend billions of dollars to build a bunch of power plants, he said.

“And the question is, is that worth it? Is it worth it for society to build those 10 new power plants just to serve the data centers for five hours a year?” Silverman said. “Or is there a better way to do it?”",https://finance-commerce.com/files/2025/09/Electric-Grid.jpg,N,,2025-09-15 19:00:49.209081

(Erie News Now) — Solar energy advocates are warning Americans could see higher electricity bills, in part, due to clean energy rollbacks they say are squeezing supply as demand surges.

Advocates say the fight isn’t just about clean energy — it’s about pocketbook issues for families and businesses.

With electricity demand climbing, the industry warns that rolling back solar could leave Americans paying more while losing the upper hand in the clean-tech and AI race to global rivals.

The U.S. solar industry is on the rise, adding 18 gigawatts of new power in just the first half of 2025. That’s more than half of all new capacity to the grid—but momentum may be dimming.

“Demand is rising at a time when the federal government is trying to constrict supply,” said Abigail Ross Hopper, president and CEO of the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA).

She says in most markets, solar is the most affordable form of energy — and that putting more affordable supply on the grid drives down costs for everybody.

But a new report by the SEIA found that Americans are on track to face higher energy bills. The potential cost increase comes after big changes to phase out Biden-era clean energy tax credits established under the Inflation Reduction Act. The One, Big, Beautiful Bill Act, signed into law by President Donald Trump in July, phases out many of the clean energy tax credits.

“Since the passage of the Big, Beautiful Bill, we have seen a number of things happen,” said Ross Hopper. “The federal government has begun to use all the tools at its disposal to make it harder to build solar and storage projects across the country.”

Ross Hopper says the changes and other federal cuts threaten up to 55 gigawatts of solar by 2030, a 25% drop.

“You don’t have to have a policy in economics to know what happens then. Electricity prices are rising. We’ve already seen a 10% year-over-year increase in electricity prices. That’s going to continue if we continue to limit supply,” said Ross Hopper.

Solar supporters argue fast, affordable projects are key to meeting skyrocketing demand from data centers, EVs and other emerging tech. But not everyone supports using taxpayer dollars to meet that demand.

“There’s an old saying, if it’s market ready, you don’t have to subsidize it,” said Rep. Mike Kelly (R-Pa.). “I am not against solar, I’m not against wind, I’m not against any of it. But I like sustainable power, sustainable energy sources. And while that may be important right now, should we be subsidizing it? We’ve got to be careful what we’re spending money on and what we’re subsidizing.”

Solar advocates stress it's not just a blue-state issue. 77% of all solar capacity installed this year has been built in states won by President Trump, including eight of the top 10 solar-leading states.

“The political backlash against solar and storage is impacting the very constituents that voted for President Trump,” said Ross Hopper.",https://WICU.images.worldnow.com/images/26602107_G.jpeg,N,,2025-09-15 18:00:13.049569

A bipartisan House proposal to “modernize” the National Environmental Policy Act has support from electric utilities who say it would help them build generation and transmission capacity they need to maintain the reliability of the nation’s electric grid.

The Standardizing Permitting and Expediting Economic Development (SPEED) Act would shorten permitting timelines, simplify the analysis NEPA requires, establish judicial review limitations and limit the use of procedural efforts to block projects, according to bill sponsors.

“The problems with the NEPA process are energy-neutral,” Rep. Jared Golden, D-Maine, said Wednesday at a House Committee on Natural Resources hearing. “They can be detrimental to both fossil fuel and renewable energy projects. … These problems with NEPA can cut both ways, and so, too, should the solutions. This is a pro-energy bill that takes an all-of-the-above, technology-neutral approach.”

Dive Insight:

Permitting reform has drawn bipartisan efforts in recent years, but previous proposals failed to yield results. With the nation’s electric grid facing rapid demand growth, renewed efforts have focused on the need add resources and maintain reliability.

Golden and Rep. Bruce Westerman, R-Ark., chair of the House Committee on Natural Resources, introduced the SPEED Act in July.

“We need robust power production and transmission to achieve energy dominance and lower costs. ... But NEPA has been warped over time to become a law that allows endless lawsuits and bureaucracy,” Golden said.

According to a summary of the legislation Golden provided, the SPEED Act will

Focus environmental reviews on “direct, significant impacts rather than hypothetical or tenuously connected effects.”

Create “reasonable timelines” for agency decisionmaking.

Streamline judicial reviews.

Clarify when a NEPA review is triggered by refining the definition of major federal action.

The MFA category “has grown so broad that nearly any federal action or funding can trigger a lengthy, complex review,” Golden’s statement said.

At Wednesday’s hearing, ClearPath Action CEO Jeremy Harrell said the broken permitting system is “the single largest barrier to deploying new clean energy in this country,” with solar energy projects facing the highest rate of NEPA litigation of all energy sources. “There’s a major challenge here.”

Electric utilities are supporting the legislation.

“Streamlining outdated permitting processes will help America’s electric companies better serve our customers and help our nation achieve energy dominance,” Edison Electric Institute President and CEO Drew Maloney said in a statement. “We ... urge Congress to advance this common-sense legislation that meaningfully removes roadblocks and supports the infrastructure that powers communities across America.” The group represents investor-owned utilities.

The National Rural Electric Cooperative Association is also backing the SPEED Act. The group said the legislation will streamline NEPA requirements on electric cooperatives applying for federal permits to build new generation, transmission and distribution capacity.

“One of the big changes in the bill is that receiving federal grants or other types of funding would no longer automatically trigger NEPA, meaning co-ops wouldn’t have to go through the review process every time they get federal money for an improvement project,” the group said.

However, Robert Glicksman, a professor of environmental law at the George Washington University Law School, cautioned against passing the SPEED Act now.

“Even if Congress is intent on revising NEPA, this is the wrong time to do it,” he said. Congress made changes to NEPA in the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023, and the Supreme Court has recently shifted judicial review toward greater deference to agencies in their NEPA preparations, he noted.

“It would make more sense to step back and evaluate the impacts of these developments, before rewriting the statute again,” Glicksman said.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/5DoSHcBkdNB-Fffs8w41xsdSu1BjEsFh0Gxva_MmWGg/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9ORVBBcGFuZWwucG5n.webp,N,,2025-09-15 19:00:36.106658

The Terra and Traveler are slated to enter production in 2027 at a new factory in Blythewood, South Carolina. Recent construction updates show significant progress on the facility, which features a body shop, a paint shop, and final assembly buildings, plus a state-of-the-art training center and technology center.

The production facility is likely part of Volkswagen’s $10 billion investment deal with the government in exchange for tariff relief. Scout Motors targets late 2027 for start of production, with both vehicles debuting as 2028 models.

India has emerged as a leader in clean energy within the G20. In fact, India became the first G20 country to meet its Paris Agreement commitments, and it has set an ambitious target of 500 gigawatts (GW) of renewable capacity by 2030. To reach this goal, India’s renewable power fleet has grown dramatically. Installed renewables (including large hydro) topped 203 GW by late 2024, up from roughly 75 GW a decade earlier. (Excluding large hydro, capacity jumped from about 39 GW in 2015 to 137 GW by early 2024.) This rapid expansion – often cited as roughly a 135% increase over FY15–FY24 – reflects strong policy support and investment. Such growth puts India on track to meet its 500 GW by 2030 goal, about 200 GW of which has already been built and underpins its clean-energy commitments on the world stage.

The role of energy storage in the renewable ecosystem

Energy storage is critical to make this renewable build-out reliable and sustainable. By buffering supply and demand, storage smooths the variability of solar and wind, improving grid stability and power quality. Storage systems also enable “time-shifting” of energy – charging when the sun is shining or wind is blowing and discharging during peak demand – which allows much higher penetration of renewables and deferral of costly grid upgrades. These services not only stabilize the grid, but they also boost energy access (by firming up intermittent power) and reduce emissions (by displacing fossil peakers).

The impact is already visible, today nearly half of India’s generation capacity is non-fossil. Renewables alone accounted for about 46% of total installed capacity by late 2024. Energy storage will be key to maintaining and growing this share of clean energy as India expands its solar and wind fleets.

Current energy storage landscape in India

India’s energy storage sector is still emerging, but growth and planning are rapid. Today, pumped hydro storage provides most bulk storage (existing projects total only a few gigawatts and hundreds of megawatt-hours), while grid-scale batteries are just beginning to roll out. Looking ahead, analyses see a big surge in storage needs. For example, the Central Electricity Authority projects 32 GW/160 GWh of battery storage will be needed by 2030 to support the 500 GW renewables target which consistent with industry estimates of ~160 Gigawatt hours (GWh) by 2030.

To meet this demand, the government is focusing on key areas:

Electric vehicles and battery manufacturing are high priorities: India has pushed EV adoption (with targets like 30% electric vehicle sales by 2030) and launched Production-Linked Incentive schemes to scale up local battery production. This will not only decarbonize transport but also build out battery supply for the grid.

At the same time, policy and infrastructure efforts are integrating storage with solar parks and hybrid projects. For instance, new solar parks increasingly include co-located battery storage, and large hybrid wind-solar parks (with storage) are being planned to balance output.

Experts note that innovations like vehicle-to-grid integration and hybrid renewable-plus-storage projects will further enhance grid reliability and security. In short, the ESS industry in India is gearing up – backed by government targets and new policies – to play a central role in the country’s clean-energy transition.

Key projects and developments

Combined, these PSUs have earmarked over Rs. 25,000 crore (US$ 3 billion) for clean energy initiatives involving storage over the next 5–7 years. The public sector's entry gives confidence to private players, ensuring that storage is not just an add-on, but a core asset in India's power ecosystem.

Types of energy storage technologies

Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS)

Lithium-ion BESS is the most widely deployed technology due to high energy density, modularity, and cost decline. For example, Tata Power commissioned a 10 MWh BESS in Delhi, while JSW Energy is building a 500 MWh project under SECI’s standalone BESS tender. BESS is crucial for peak load shaving and renewable firming.

Pumped Hydro Storage (PHS)

India’s 4.8 GW of installed PHS includes projects like Tehri (Uttarakhand) and Purulia (West Bengal). These systems pump water to a higher elevation during surplus and release it to generate electricity during peak demand. NHPC and SJVN are exploring over 15 GW of new PHS capacity, particularly in hilly states.

Thermal Energy Storage

Used in industrial and CSP applications, thermal storage involves heat retention in media like molten salt. The NTPC Dadri plant evaluated a thermal energy storage pilot with phase change materials. L&T is also involved in developing CSP-based hybrid thermal storage solutions, aimed at supporting industrial load balancing and process heat needs.

Flow Batteries and Hydrogen Storage

Flow batteries, like vanadium redox, offer scalable long-duration storage with better safety. IIT Madras and IOCL are piloting flow battery prototypes. On the hydrogen front, NTPC is developing a green hydrogen project in Leh, integrating BESS and electrolysers to store energy as hydrogen, enabling seasonal storage and grid decarbonisation.

Policy and regulatory support

Recognising the strategic importance of energy storage, the Indian government has rolled out several initiatives:

Production Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme for Advanced Chemistry Cell (ACC) Batteries: Allocated Rs. 18,100 crore (US$ 2.14 billion) to support domestic manufacturing.

Draft Electricity (Amendment) Bill: Proposed inclusion of energy storage as a distinct asset class.

Energy Storage Roadmap by MNRE and NITI Aayog: Outlines capacity needs, technology preferences, and investment frameworks.

Additionally, states like Maharashtra, Gujarat, and Tamil Nadu are formulating storage policies in-line with their renewable energy goals.

Energy storage is the missing puzzle from India's clean energy journey. It promises to carry the load of ambition and action by making renewable energy dispatchable, reliable, and sustainable. Consequently, with technology costs being reduced, policy support growing, and innovations being accelerated, India is very well positioned to becoming an international leader in energy storage solutions.

Unlocking this potential will ensure energy security and climate resilience along with job creation, import dependency reduction, and enabling a sustainable future.",,N,,2025-09-15 19:00:20.648211

Letter to the editor Posted September 14, 2025 ( The Virginian Pilot and Daily Press)

Offshore wind off the Virginia Beach coast means reliable power for families, new jobs for our communities, and more substantial support for our military bases.

Speaker Mike Johnson’s recent support for the Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind Project is more than welcome—it is necessary. This project will power more than 600,000 homes, strengthen our military bases, and position Virginia as a leader in securing America’s energy future.

For too long, debates over energy have been framed as either/or. Either fossil fuels or renewables. Either traditional energy or innovation. The truth is, we need it all. As Congresswoman Jen Kiggans has rightly argued, an “all-of-the-above” approach is not just good policy—it’s common sense.

Energy security is one of the great national security challenges of our time. Our adversaries are pouring billions into alternative energy to modernize their grids and reduce vulnerabilities. If we ignore clean energy, we fall behind. Offshore wind is not a luxury—it is a strategic necessity.

For Virginia, the benefits are undeniable. This project creates jobs, expands local supply chains, and generates private investment in our communities. It strengthens the infrastructure that keeps our military ready and our lights on. And it ensures the Commonwealth is not just a consumer of energy, but a driver of innovation.

That is why it is so encouraging to see Speaker Johnson and Congresswoman Kiggans urging the Trump Administration to prioritize this project. Their leadership shows that clean energy is not a partisan cause—it is an American imperative. Offshore wind is about security, prosperity, and keeping Virginia—and America—strong.

By diversifying its monetization strategies—combining direct sales, joint ventures, and government grants—Opal Fuels can create a resilient financial model.","The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022 has reshaped the U.S. clean energy landscape, offering a suite of tax credits and incentives designed to accelerate the transition to sustainable infrastructure. For companies like

, which operates at the intersection of energy innovation and infrastructure development, these provisions present a unique opportunity to scale operations while leveraging federal support. While direct information on Opal Fuels' specific IRA strategies remains scarce, industry trends and the broader context of clean energy investment suggest a compelling narrative for how tax credit monetization could drive its growth.

The IRA's Role in Clean Energy Infrastructure

The IRA builds on the foundational work of the 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, which emphasized modernizing infrastructure to reduce carbon footprints and enhance energy efficiency : Why we must invest in sustainable infrastructure[ 1 ]. The 2022 legislation expands this vision by introducing tax credits for renewable energy projects, carbon capture technologies, and grid modernization. These incentives are not merely subsidies but tools for monetizing environmental value—transforming emissions reductions and energy efficiency gains into quantifiable financial assets.

For instance, the IRA's 45Q tax credit for carbon capture and storage offers up to $90 per metric ton of CO₂ sequestered, creating a revenue stream for companies that integrate these technologies into their operations. Similarly, the 48C Advanced Manufacturing Tax Credit provides grants or tax reductions for domestic production of clean energy components, incentivizing supply chain localization. These mechanisms align with Opal Fuels' stated focus on decarbonizing energy systems, suggesting a natural fit for leveraging IRA provisions.

Tax Credit Monetization: A Strategic Imperative

Monetizing tax credits is increasingly becoming a core competency for clean energy firms. According to a report by BloombergNEF, companies that effectively structure their projects to access tax incentives can reduce capital costs by 20–30%, significantly improving return on investment . For Opal Fuels, this could mean partnering with tax equity investors—entities that provide capital in exchange for the right to claim tax credits—or directly selling credits to corporations seeking to meet environmental, social, and governance (ESG) targets.

The latter strategy, in particular, has gained traction. Large corporations, including those in the tech and automotive sectors, are purchasing carbon credits and renewable energy certificates (RECs) to offset emissions. The IRA's enhanced credits make these assets more valuable, creating a secondary market where companies like Opal Fuels could generate recurring revenue. While no public announcements from Opal Fuels confirm such partnerships, the market dynamics strongly suggest this is a viable path.

Risks and Considerations

Despite the opportunities, tax credit monetization is not without challenges. Regulatory complexity, project development timelines, and market volatility in credit pricing could delay returns. Additionally, the IRA's phase-out provisions for certain credits after 2032 introduce long-term uncertainty. Investors must also weigh the risk of over-reliance on federal policy, which remains subject to political shifts.

However, for a company with Opal Fuels' technical expertise and infrastructure focus, these risks are manageable. By diversifying its monetization strategies—combining direct sales, joint ventures, and government grants—Opal Fuels can create a resilient financial model. This approach mirrors that of industry leaders like NextEra Energy and

, which have successfully integrated tax credits into their growth strategies.

Conclusion: A Blueprint for Growth

While Opal Fuels has not yet disclosed specific IRA-related projects, the alignment between its business model and the Act's incentives is clear. By treating tax credits as a strategic asset rather than a peripheral benefit, the company can accelerate its clean energy transition while generating value for stakeholders. For investors, this represents an opportunity to back a firm positioned to capitalize on one of the most transformative policy frameworks in U.S. history.",https://lh-prod-oper-pub-opercenter.s3.amazonaws.com/discovery-image/compress-19bd1a888b938005.png,N,,2025-09-16 00:00:18.516056

In addition to PV carports, the company uses a variety of tactics to meet these goals, First Solar said in the 2023 report.
Utility-scale solar capacity accounts for about two-thirds of all U.S. solar capacity.
Although the project’s half-million First Solar solar panels are arrayed on 2,000 acres in Arkansas, the power they generate supplies GM plants in Michigan and Missouri.
Throughout the company’s advanced manufacturing and warehousing operations, solar energy is used to charge IoT systems, automation and robotics, and battery-powered industrial vehicles.","Imagine pulling into your work parking spot and leaving your vehicle in a shaded carport topped by solar panels that generate electricity for the lights and equipment inside the building.

Since 2023, that’s what workers at a First Solar Inc. production facility in Ohio have done. As such, they’ve followed in the footsteps—or tire tracks—of First Solar facilities in Germany, Vietnam and Malaysia.

Why should other companies follow First Solar’s lead? Helena Jochberger, global industry lead for information technology and business consultant firm CGI Inc., Montreal, outlined the strategic benefits for using use renewable energy.

“It not only reduces their carbon footprint and aligns them closer with ESG (environmental, social and governance) commitments and regulations, distributed energy resources (DERs)—like solar panels, wind-generation units and battery storage—empower companies to boost energy independence and resilience over a long period of time,” she explains. “By harnessing DERs to become their own energy producers, manufacturers take a more active role in their energy future in a market that is constantly changing. This makes achieving sustainability from an ESG and economic standpoint far more attainable.”

But implementing renewables is just the first step, according to Jochberger. Next is collecting data to demonstrate sustainability efforts and achievements. She cautions that when building a sustainability road map, companies need to collect accurate data about every step of their production process, from raw materials to a finished product.

“Leveraging digital tools like Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled energy monitoring and digital twins to help manufacturers deploy and monitor their renewable energy strategies can create even more value,” she says. “By tracking their progress and identifying inefficiencies in real time, manufacturers can not only generate their own power and reach net zero—they can do so efficiently and at scale.”

CGI client LKAB Minerals Ltd., a public iron ore mining company in Sweden, is in a joint effort to use hydrogen in its operations to reduce CO2 emissions, with the goal of fossil-free steel by 2035. Although solar power is not in its arsenal, LKAB does use alternative energy from wind and hydropower.

“If you have started that transition (to alternative energy), speed up,” Stefan Savonen, LKAB’s vice president of energy, advised in a recent podcast. “If you haven’t started, it’s time to start. Climate is a driving force, but a large part is also business. There is this huge business opportunity for the company, for yourself and for your well-being to start now … no time to lose.”

As a solar panel manufacturer, it’s no surprise that First Solar would have taken Savonen’s advice as well as the extra step of installing shaded photovoltaic (PV) carports. But the company’s solar efforts go beyond this.

Globally, First Solar’s PV arrays generated 7.5 million kWh in 2023, according to the company’s 2024 Sustainability Report. At an average yearly use of 10,800 kWh in an American home, that’s enough energy to power nearly 700 homes.

In 2021, First Solar set a goal of using 30% less energy per watt produced by 2028, compared with its 2020 usage. By 2023, it was halfway to that metric. And by 2026, First Solar set a target of powering 100% of its U.S. operations with renewable energy. It set a similar goal—100% renewable energy—for global operations by 2028.

In addition to PV carports, the company uses a variety of tactics to meet these goals, First Solar said in the 2023 report. “Since 2009, we have successfully reduced our greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, energy, water and waste intensity per watt produced by implementing resource conservation and low-carbon projects at our facilities and through improvements in module efficiency, manufacturing throughput, manufacturing yield and capacity utilization.”

Let the Sun Shine

By the end of 2023, the U.S. had an estimated total solar capacity of 139 gigawatts (GW)— an increase of more than 26 GW or 23% from 2022, according to Climate Central’s report, “A Decade of Growth in Solar and Wind Power.” Citing data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), the report says U.S. installations produced 238,121 GWh (GWh) of electricity from solar in 2023—more than eight times the amount generated in 2014.

Utility-scale solar capacity accounts for about two-thirds of all U.S. solar capacity. In 2023, utility-scale solar comprised around 8% of the nation’s total electricity capacity from all utility-scale sources (renewables, nuclear and fossil fuels), compared to about 1% in 2014, Climate Central says. And most of the nation’s new energy capacity is expected to come from renewable sources such solar and wind— shifting the energy mix away from fossil fuels (coal, oil and natural gas) that produce carbon pollution, EIA forecasts.

Much of the capacity is being used by the manufacturing industry--and such efforts are becoming increasingly visible. Drivers on northbound Interstate I-75 in Saginaw, Mich., for example, can’t help but be struck by some 17,000 solar panels that help power Nexteer Automotive Group Ltd.’s facility, which supplies motion-control technology to domestic and international automakers. Developed in partnership with NorthStar Clean Energy, a subsidiary of CMS Energy Corp. that is the parent company of Michigan utility Consumers Energy, the prominent array started providing renewable energy to the 25-acre site in May 2024.

In addition to reducing operational costs, Nexteer expects the following results from its Saginaw solar array:

Lowering GHG emissions by 7,000 metric tons annually, which is equivalent to saving about 788,000 gallons of gasoline per year, based on the Environmental Protection Agency’s conversion calculator

Preparing Nexteer for growing expectations of its OEM customers for a sustainable supply chain

Supporting progress toward global clean-energy transition via enablers such as renewables, energy efficiency and electrification—as well as the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals, such as: Affordable and Clean Energy (No. 7); Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure (No. 9); and Climate Action (No. 13)

One-fifth of Nexteer’s global energy comes from renewable sources, according to its 2024 Sustainability Report. “We continue to advance our climate road map strategy across global operations based on a portfolio of energy-efficiency measures, solar projects and power purchase agreement (PPA) initiatives (see sidebar p. XX). Additionally, efforts like our PPA in Mexico are supporting regional and community goals to green the electric grid,” according to the report.

Power Sharing

Three General Motors Co. assembly plants get their electricity from NorthStar’s 410,000-mWh Newport Solar project in Newport, Ark., through a 15-year PPA. Although the project’s half-million First Solar solar panels are arrayed on 2,000 acres in Arkansas, the power they generate supplies GM plants in Michigan and Missouri.

The PPA is the automotive company’s largest one yet, and a milestone in GM becoming carbon-neutral by 2040.

In 2022, GM finalized agreements to secure 100% of the electricity needed to power all of its U.S. sites with renewables by the end of 2025, according to an August 2024 article in GM News. However, the company’s 2023 sustainability report “Journey to Zero” reported it achieved just 39% of its goal of “sourcing 100% renewable electricity globally by 2035.”

While Nexteer and GM use huge solar arrays that occupy acreage to power their operations, others in the manufacturing sector plan to use rooftop solar to source their electricity, depending on the level of their energy use and their geographic location, according to a 2023 study by a group of engineers at Northeastern University.

“Our findings show that light manufacturing sectors such as furniture and apparel can cover their average net annual electricity demand by utilizing their own rooftop potential in locations across the country, while several other sectors can achieve electricity self-sufficiency but in a smaller subset of U.S. locations,” the authors wrote in “Technical Feasibility of Powering U.S. Manufacturing with Rooftop Solar PV.”

In spring and summer, nearly 40% of three-digit manufacturing sectors (i.e., specific subsectors in the North American Industry Classification System) could utilize solar PV for their electricity needs in the U.S. Southwest, according to the study.

“Regions like the Southeast that have a large concentration of low-electricity-intensity furniture and textile product operations will have greater opportunities to convert to full on-site generation,” according to the study. “In contrast, high-electricity-intensity food processing operations in the Southwest will struggle to generate enough electricity on-site to cover demand, despite a favorable solar resource.”

Results Start on the Roof

Two companies using rooftop solar include a Midwest-based furniture manufacturer and a solar-car startup in California.

In 2019, Ashley Furniture Industries Inc., Arcadia, Wisc., embarked on a multiphase project to install solar panels on 10 of its largest U.S. facilities, including its advanced manufacturing headquarters in Arcadia.

Throughout the company’s advanced manufacturing and warehousing operations, solar energy is used to charge IoT systems, automation and robotics, and battery-powered industrial vehicles. Ashley’s solar panel installations are expected to generate about 25 million kWh annually, according to an update in the company’s 2024 Corporate Social Responsibility report.

At Aptera Motors Corp., Carlsbad, Calif., the vehicle maker’s product-design goal meshes with that of its building’s owner. Aptera’s solar-powered vehicle’s battery, frame and body are produced in a two-story facility topped by 892 Silfab solar panels. “The system’s estimated annual output of 703,284 kWh provides nearly all the energy that Aptera will use each year,” according to a Silfab Solar case study.

“The fusion generator in the sky, the sun, is a renewable energy source that we will continue to utilize in every shape and form,” Aptera Co-CEO Chris Anthony said in another case study.

“Our mission is clear: move towards a sustainable future that empowers people around the world to get where they need to go with less impact on the planet and little need to pull from an external power source,” Anthony continues. “We hope to inspire other companies to do the same, and we could not be prouder of the brighter future we are building.”",https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/advancedmanufacturing.org/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/6/8c/68c2606d-de01-4fce-9d91-01eef0be7af4/68c8643926ab9.image.jpg?crop=844%2C443%2C115%2C0,N,,2025-09-15 22:00:59.812582

In addition to PV carports, the company uses a variety of tactics to meet these goals, First Solar said in the 2023 report.
Utility-scale solar capacity accounts for about two-thirds of all U.S. solar capacity.
Although the project’s half-million First Solar solar panels are arrayed on 2,000 acres in Arkansas, the power they generate supplies GM plants in Michigan and Missouri.
Throughout the company’s advanced manufacturing and warehousing operations, solar energy is used to charge IoT systems, automation and robotics, and battery-powered industrial vehicles.","Imagine pulling into your work parking spot and leaving your vehicle in a shaded carport topped by solar panels that generate electricity for the lights and equipment inside the building.

Since 2023, that’s what workers at a First Solar Inc. production facility in Ohio have done. As such, they’ve followed in the footsteps—or tire tracks—of First Solar facilities in Germany, Vietnam and Malaysia.

Why should other companies follow First Solar’s lead? Helena Jochberger, global industry lead for information technology and business consultant firm CGI Inc., Montreal, outlined the strategic benefits for using use renewable energy.

“It not only reduces their carbon footprint and aligns them closer with ESG (environmental, social and governance) commitments and regulations, distributed energy resources (DERs)—like solar panels, wind-generation units and battery storage—empower companies to boost energy independence and resilience over a long period of time,” she explains. “By harnessing DERs to become their own energy producers, manufacturers take a more active role in their energy future in a market that is constantly changing. This makes achieving sustainability from an ESG and economic standpoint far more attainable.”

But implementing renewables is just the first step, according to Jochberger. Next is collecting data to demonstrate sustainability efforts and achievements. She cautions that when building a sustainability road map, companies need to collect accurate data about every step of their production process, from raw materials to a finished product.

“Leveraging digital tools like Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled energy monitoring and digital twins to help manufacturers deploy and monitor their renewable energy strategies can create even more value,” she says. “By tracking their progress and identifying inefficiencies in real time, manufacturers can not only generate their own power and reach net zero—they can do so efficiently and at scale.”

CGI client LKAB Minerals Ltd., a public iron ore mining company in Sweden, is in a joint effort to use hydrogen in its operations to reduce CO2 emissions, with the goal of fossil-free steel by 2035. Although solar power is not in its arsenal, LKAB does use alternative energy from wind and hydropower.

“If you have started that transition (to alternative energy), speed up,” Stefan Savonen, LKAB’s vice president of energy, advised in a recent podcast. “If you haven’t started, it’s time to start. Climate is a driving force, but a large part is also business. There is this huge business opportunity for the company, for yourself and for your well-being to start now … no time to lose.”

As a solar panel manufacturer, it’s no surprise that First Solar would have taken Savonen’s advice as well as the extra step of installing shaded photovoltaic (PV) carports. But the company’s solar efforts go beyond this.

Globally, First Solar’s PV arrays generated 7.5 million kWh in 2023, according to the company’s 2024 Sustainability Report. At an average yearly use of 10,800 kWh in an American home, that’s enough energy to power nearly 700 homes.

In 2021, First Solar set a goal of using 30% less energy per watt produced by 2028, compared with its 2020 usage. By 2023, it was halfway to that metric. And by 2026, First Solar set a target of powering 100% of its U.S. operations with renewable energy. It set a similar goal—100% renewable energy—for global operations by 2028.

In addition to PV carports, the company uses a variety of tactics to meet these goals, First Solar said in the 2023 report. “Since 2009, we have successfully reduced our greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, energy, water and waste intensity per watt produced by implementing resource conservation and low-carbon projects at our facilities and through improvements in module efficiency, manufacturing throughput, manufacturing yield and capacity utilization.”

Let the Sun Shine

By the end of 2023, the U.S. had an estimated total solar capacity of 139 gigawatts (GW)— an increase of more than 26 GW or 23% from 2022, according to Climate Central’s report, “A Decade of Growth in Solar and Wind Power.” Citing data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), the report says U.S. installations produced 238,121 GWh (GWh) of electricity from solar in 2023—more than eight times the amount generated in 2014.

Utility-scale solar capacity accounts for about two-thirds of all U.S. solar capacity. In 2023, utility-scale solar comprised around 8% of the nation’s total electricity capacity from all utility-scale sources (renewables, nuclear and fossil fuels), compared to about 1% in 2014, Climate Central says. And most of the nation’s new energy capacity is expected to come from renewable sources such solar and wind— shifting the energy mix away from fossil fuels (coal, oil and natural gas) that produce carbon pollution, EIA forecasts.

Much of the capacity is being used by the manufacturing industry--and such efforts are becoming increasingly visible. Drivers on northbound Interstate I-75 in Saginaw, Mich., for example, can’t help but be struck by some 17,000 solar panels that help power Nexteer Automotive Group Ltd.’s facility, which supplies motion-control technology to domestic and international automakers. Developed in partnership with NorthStar Clean Energy, a subsidiary of CMS Energy Corp. that is the parent company of Michigan utility Consumers Energy, the prominent array started providing renewable energy to the 25-acre site in May 2024.

In addition to reducing operational costs, Nexteer expects the following results from its Saginaw solar array:

Lowering GHG emissions by 7,000 metric tons annually, which is equivalent to saving about 788,000 gallons of gasoline per year, based on the Environmental Protection Agency’s conversion calculator

Preparing Nexteer for growing expectations of its OEM customers for a sustainable supply chain

Supporting progress toward global clean-energy transition via enablers such as renewables, energy efficiency and electrification—as well as the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals, such as: Affordable and Clean Energy (No. 7); Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure (No. 9); and Climate Action (No. 13)

One-fifth of Nexteer’s global energy comes from renewable sources, according to its 2024 Sustainability Report. “We continue to advance our climate road map strategy across global operations based on a portfolio of energy-efficiency measures, solar projects and power purchase agreement (PPA) initiatives (see sidebar p. XX). Additionally, efforts like our PPA in Mexico are supporting regional and community goals to green the electric grid,” according to the report.

Power Sharing

Three General Motors Co. assembly plants get their electricity from NorthStar’s 410,000-mWh Newport Solar project in Newport, Ark., through a 15-year PPA. Although the project’s half-million First Solar solar panels are arrayed on 2,000 acres in Arkansas, the power they generate supplies GM plants in Michigan and Missouri.

The PPA is the automotive company’s largest one yet, and a milestone in GM becoming carbon-neutral by 2040.

In 2022, GM finalized agreements to secure 100% of the electricity needed to power all of its U.S. sites with renewables by the end of 2025, according to an August 2024 article in GM News. However, the company’s 2023 sustainability report “Journey to Zero” reported it achieved just 39% of its goal of “sourcing 100% renewable electricity globally by 2035.”

While Nexteer and GM use huge solar arrays that occupy acreage to power their operations, others in the manufacturing sector plan to use rooftop solar to source their electricity, depending on the level of their energy use and their geographic location, according to a 2023 study by a group of engineers at Northeastern University.

DP World is also looking at the circular economy when it comes to aftermarket battery management.

DP World supports battery makers in the development of new gigafactories, alongside aftermarket contract logistics services.","Electrification is now a primary driver of complexity in automotive supply chains. The transition from internal-combustion to battery electric powertrains is advancing at different speeds across regions. China leads on the back of decades of investment from critical minerals to new energy vehicles (NEV) manufacturing and distribution, while Europe and the US are accelerating from a lower base with uneven momentum. Across markets, OEMs are prioritising battery logistics, hazardous-goods-ready infrastructure, proximity to production, compliant data and circular aftermarket flows – to de-risk operations and scale.

“If you are an OEM now you have to provide multiple powertrains because that shift to electric vehicles (EVs) is somewhere in transition depending on where in the world you are,” says David D’Annunzio, global vice-president and vertical head for Automotive at DP World. “While an EV has fewer parts and is easier to assemble, there are multiple variants of internal combustion and EVs, often being made in the same factory, increasing the complexity of assembly.”

The need to meet demand for both internal combustion (ICE) and EV variants also impacts the provision of service parts, the volume of which has increased by roughly a third because of the need to stock parts for both types of vehicles. For EVs, aftermarket battery services have their own very specific requirements and include regulation on recycling.

Bringing home the battery

OEMs face a strategic choice: one based on whether they purchase batteries from suppliers or vertically integrate into production. Ownership of battery production, independently or via joint ventures, requires significant capital but increases an OEMs control over cost, quality, resilience and the ability to navigate restrictions on trade. Recent examples include Toyota, which started its own battery production in the US this year at a $14 billion factory in North Carolina – its first in-house plant outside Japan, supplying hybrid, plug-in hybrid and pure EVs. In Europe Stellantis is establishing a joint venture with CATL to make a lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery plant in Zaragoza, Spain.

Vertical integration is a lesson Henry Ford learned back in the early days of car production and vehicle makers are returning to that original strategy in relation to battery production, according to D’Annunzio.

“One of the things that happened to Henry Ford was that the Dodge brothers originally provided full chassis to his company but then turned around and started their own business,” says D’Annunzio. “That irritated Henry Ford. He set up his own manufacturing and was 100% vertically integrated so no one could ever do that to him again.”

Careful handling

Crucially, lithium battery production and movement demand specialised, hazardous good logistics. EV batteries are categorised as hazardous goods under UN international dangerous goods regulations for road and air transport. Temperature, humidity and state of charge must be tightly controlled, and safeguards need to be in place to avoid any thermal runaway risks, which are difficult to extinguish.

DP World is providing battery logistics support, including deliveries both to assembly plants and to the EV dealer/service centre networks.

D’Annunzio notes most movements are simple, short-haul deliveries because battery manufacturing is deliberately located close to assembly plants and the centre of gravity for dealer distribution to try to minimise the hazards of moving batteries. “As long as they have been stored properly and they have the right state of charge, moving them from a storage location to either a manufacturing plant or to a service parts distribution location is an easy thing to do,” he says.

However, the right equipment and training is essential. At DP World storage locations, staff must be certified to manage hazardous goods by way of ensuring compliant handling and storage. Lithium batteries are segregated in dedicated zones, equipped with appropriate fire suppression systems and specialised lifting and charging equipment. With a decade of experience moving EVs and their batteries, we maintain an unblemished safety record.

DP World is also looking at the circular economy when it comes to aftermarket battery management. “The way the automotive aftermarket is set up for EV batteries is very simple,” says D’Annunzio. “If you take a battery and deliver it to the dealership you have to pick up the old battery and bring it back and recycle the black mass for somebody else. That is exactly what we do.”

Beyond operational changes, DP World has pledged to become carbon neutral by 2050, with interim targets for 2030, aligning with global climate frameworks. These commitments are driving investments such as electrified trucking fleets, modal shifts from road to rail, and the deployment of electric and autonomous vehicles at ports and terminals – ensuring that battery logistics is managed sustainably end-to-end.

Passport to power

In Europe, the battery passport (EU Battery Pass) will be mandatory from 2027 – a digital certificate which will enable consumers to verify the sustainability and environmental credentials of batteries used in electric vehicles (EVs). It will provide a document of data along a battery’s entire lifecycle. Today, we are seeing industry leaders collaborating to drive and advance the development of the first, trusted industry wide passport. For example, Path.Era, a collaboration between carmakers BMW and VW Group and suppliers BASF, Henkel, Siemens, working with consultant Deloitte, are currently working on the first industry-wide, trusted battery passport. China is currently working on a battery passport initiative to align with and facilitate trade with the EU’s battery regulations. However, outside of Europe, the situation is less consistent and is down to logistics providers to adhere with local and regional legislation.

Alongside regulatory compliance, DP World applies digital monitoring to the batteries in its care. This includes real-time checks on temperature, humidity and state of charge to ensure stability during storage and movement. These measures provide early-warning safeguards that reduce the risk of incidents and support transparent, auditable supply chains.

D’Annunzio indicated that when solid state batteries become less expensive to produce, regulations will be less complex given the greater stability afforded by that battery chemistry and the concern will be focused on those lithium-ion batteries still out in the marketplace.

Keep your options open

Powertrain transition and the localisation of battery production are amplifying supply-chain complexity amid broader trade upheaval, challenging OEMs, suppliers and logistics providers alike.

“We are all grappling with that,” notes D’Annunzio. “What we are telling our customers is that the best that you can do today is have flexibility, or as Jim Tompkins [CEO Tomkins Ventures] calls it, ‘optionality in your supply chain’.”

Building in optionality means being able to react faster to whatever the market throws your way. What is important for traditional carmakers to understand, according to D’Annnunzio, is that having options ready doesn’t always mean aiming for the one with the lowest cost anymore. “You need that little bit of extra insurance as things are changing rapidly,” he says. “That is a very difficult message to get across to OEMs in general and more importantly, OEMs that are in financial distress because of everything else that is going on.”

China in charge

While EV growth in Europe and the United States is progressing unevenly, China remains a global leader. Chinese OEMs produce 60% of all NEVs and 70% of all batteries, with capacity outstripping local demand. This surplus is driving assertive export strategies.

China’s BYD has rapidly scaled exports from hundreds of thousands to close to a million vehicles annually, while localising NEV assembly in key overseas markets to mitigate tariffs. As BYD and others have indicated, nearshoring combined with vertical integration simplifies a carmaker’s supply chain at a time of complexity. China’s NEV makers are smashing the traditional five-year vehicle development cycle – designing, producing and testing a vehicle ready for release in 18 months.

Intensifying competitive pressure from China is forcing traditional American and European OEMs to articulate clear strategic responses.

DP World is positioning itself to manage the complex needs of Chinese NEV customers making electric vehicles, including comprehensive services for battery handling and storage.

“As Chinese carmakers expand around the world, we want to be there to help them with their destination logistics, whether that be for the NEVs that they are exporting or in local manufacturing assistance and service parts distribution among other services,” says D’Annunzio.

DP World supports battery makers in the development of new gigafactories, alongside aftermarket contract logistics services. More specifically, for Foton, DP World is blending contract logistics and tailored market-entry and expansion services on a unified platform, managing the legal entity for Foton.

“Foton stocks inventory in our warehouse; when an order for a part comes by, we buy it from Foton, deliver and remit the funds,” says D’Annunzio. “Rather than being a pure logistics service provider we are also their trading partner in South Africa. Those are the type of innovative solutions that we are trying to come up with for our Chinese clients as they expand around the world.”",https://image.automotivelogistics.media/666434.jpg?imageId=666434&x=0&y=0&cropw=100&croph=100&panox=0&panoy=0&panow=100&panoh=100&width=1200&height=683,N,,2025-09-15 16:01:04.313363

Sponsor spotlight: Siemens and the energy transition

Siemens, a leader in automation and machinery manufacturing, is the panel's sponsor, introduced by a keynote address from Stacy Mahler, Siemens' US Head of Sustainability.

With over 15 years of experience in the industrial and energy sectors, Stacy guides organisations along sustainability pathways.

Her work focuses on infrastructure advancements for enhanced energy efficiency, integrating renewable energy and promoting the electrification of transport and infrastructure.

Stacy also manages the carbon reduction strategies for Siemens Smart Infrastructure in the US.

With a degree in Electrical Engineering from the University of Florida and an MBA from Northwestern University, her expertise anchors the discussion.

Technologies like solar rooftops, wind farms, microgrids and virtual power plants are set to enhance resilience against outages, minimise transmission losses and democratise clean energy access.

Corporate pioneers continue to innovate distributed solutions, while governmental bodies adapt regulations to embrace peer-to-peer energy trading.

Decentralisation is also key to rural electrification, especially in emerging nations where microgrids can bypass traditional grid systems.

Electrification across sectors

The electrification of transport and heavy industry is a priority to reduce reliance on fossil fuels.

Electric vehicles are increasingly popular, with many automakers transitioning away from combustion engines.

Industries like steelmaking and cement are progressively shifting towards renewable power sources.

Meeting these demands without affecting grid reliability will require advancements in energy storage, demand response systems and grid modernisation.

​​​​​​​Green hydrogen and sustainable fuel alternatives

Green hydrogen, produced through renewable-powered electrolysis, emerges as a crucial component of the energy transition.

Providing solutions for sectors where direct electrification is challenging, such as aviation and heavy industry, it sees increased investment from companies like Air Liquide, Siemens Energy and bp.

Alongside biofuels and synthetic options, hydrogen holds potential for decarbonising global trade and transport. Nonetheless, scaling necessitates significant investment, cost reductions and policy support.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/7549278eab6ed64bebe34291b389d79f:365dd23ae2ad9f0df1a9de174fd566ab/a9848a93-4fe0-4d32-a348-ac01aa73da64.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-09-15 20:00:58.934811

You don’t have to walk far in Keene to spot a home with shiny black solar panels affixed to the roof.

The city has issued more than 230 permits for solar installations since 2017. Those installations were relatively rare until 2022. From 2018 to 2022, the city issued 51 permits. Since 2022, the city has issued 180.

Those incentives were rolled back in July when President Donald Trump signed what’s known as the One Big Beautiful Bill. Experts say that rollback could make solar less appealing for some property owners, but other factors, like electric costs, could help counterbalance it.

Rapid growth

According to city data, three solar installation permits were issued in 2018. The next three years saw a slight increase, with numbers hovering in the teens, but in 2022 something changed; solar permit applications began to come in much more rapidly.

The city issued 49 permits that year, 73 in 2023 and 58 in 2024. With four months left to go in 2025, the city has already issued 48.

The Inflation Reduction Act, signed into law under President Joe Biden on Aug. 16, 2022, implemented the Residential Clean Energy Credit, equal to 30 percent of the cost of a new clean energy system.

That means that a homeowner who spent $10,000 on a solar array, solar water heater, or battery storage could be exempt from $3,000 in taxes that year, and be eligible for additional exemptions in the future.

Clean Energy N.H. Executive Director Sam Evans-Brown said the act brought a lot of attention to solar, with more interest in both residential and commercial projects throughout the state.

Spiking electricity prices in 2023 and 2024 added fuel to the fire, he said, as people sought ways to reduce their energy costs.

The growth of solar installations in Keene that has followed that act is part of a national trend of solar growth. The installed capacity of residential solar projects in the U.S. has grown by more than 19,000 megawatts since 2021.

Utility-scale solar has grown even more rapidly.

In total, there’s now enough solar capacity nationwide to power more than 41 million homes.

The city of Keene has worked to incentive that trend. In 2020, the city earned a SolSmart bronze designation from the U.S. Department of Energy program for efforts to make solar a more affordable choice for homes and businesses.

Then-Mayor George Hansel said the designation was “a testament to the shared commitment by our citizens, elected leaders, city staff, businesses, and other community partners to reach our ambitious renewable energy goals.”

The city offers a property tax exemption for solar and other renewable energy systems equal to their total assessed value. That exemption is available to both homeowners and businesses.

Variables

“There’s a lot of variables involved,” when homeowners or businesses are considering going solar, according to Scott Maslansky, who directs the clean energy finance program of the Community Development Finance Authority.

Tax credits and other incentives, like the Rural Energy for America grant program for businesses, are one thing people take into account. But they also consider things like their electrical costs or whether they’re planning to get a heat pump or electric vehicle, both of which need a lot of power.

“All of those things contributed” to the growth of solar over the past few years, he said.

Maslansky said he believes many people who had been thinking about going solar for a long time jumped at the 30 percent tax credit when it became available. He installed a solar array on his own home last year, in part to take advantage of that credit.

What happens now?

The July, One Big Beautiful Bill set in motion the rollback of most of the solar incentives that the Inflation Reduction Act started. Most were set to run for at least a decade. Now, they’ll phase out over the next two years.

The solar tax credit for homeowners is set to end at the end of the year. Businesses have a little more time; projects just need to be underway by mid 2026 or completed by the end of 2027 to qualify.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture announced last month it won’t provide any more funding through REAP, the program that covered up to 50 percent of the cost of renewable energy projects at rural small businesses.

Maslansky said he expects to see a short-term spike in solar installations through the end of the year as people hurry to qualify for incentives before they expire.

Longer-term plans, like developments that might have been considering building solar-ready, might be more likely to change their mind, he said.

Evans-Brown said he expects a “rush for the doors” in the last quarter of 2025.

“If you’re thinking about it, now is the time to do it,” he said.

But once the incentives expire, both experts said they expect a fall-off in interest.

With the REAP program in limbo, some companies who had planned to go solar might decide it’s no longer worth it.

“That will definitely cause a drop,” Maslansky said.

But for most home and businessowners, there are still good reasons to go solar.

Rising electrical costs could make solar look more and more desirable, according to Maslansky and Evans-Brown.

If you lose a 30 percent tax credit but electric costs go up 40 percent, solar still pays for itself in the anticipated timeframe, Evans-Brown explained.

“Taking on debt for something you’re going to see pay back on makes sense,” Maslansky said.

On the other hand, tariffs could cause the price of solar equipment to go up, making it a less cost-effective option.

Both said tariffs are a big area of uncertainty, but Evans-Brown said ongoing incentives for domestic manufacturing of solar equipment could increase US manufacturing.

Keeping up

As in many other areas of the economy, things are changing rapidly in the solar industry. It can be difficult to keep up.

Maslansky recommends property owners consult Clean Energy N.H.’s webpage or speak with a solar contractor to get up-to-date information.

“You really do have to be plugged in,” Evans-Brown said. “You have to do serious research.

“One of the challenges right now is that things are changing really quickly, and it is hard to get good information.”

Connecting with a solar installer or becoming a Clean Energy N.H. member can make things easier, he said.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c5c8373/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5699x2992+0+325/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F1a%2F8a%2F604bfb4b4144b4b9635fb688fbe8%2Fsolar-power-panels-tuohy-stock-photo.JPG,N,,2025-09-15 16:01:08.479023

Green firms in the US have found something of a lifeline in artificial intelligence after being bogged down by high interest rates, shrinking funding and, more recently, President Donald Trump’s sharp rollback of support.

Clean technology companies that have inked deals to support data centers have seen their stocks soar this year, outperforming the S&P 500. Nuclear power startup Oklo Inc.’s shares are up nearly 275% year-to-date while the stock price of fuel cell provider Bloom Energy Corp. has risen 66%. Energy storage and clean power snagged the most public and private investment among climate tech sectors last quarter, according to BloombergNEF.

Even as some clean energy firms struggle to convince investors that they can thrive during Trump’s second term, the AI-driven surge in electric demand — the most in decades — is providing clear tailwinds for others.

“That has reinvigorated enthusiasm for companies that benefit from the trend,” said Jeff Osborne, a senior clean energy analyst with TD Cowen.

But the data center boom may prove short-lived for some carbon-free tech companies. While the age of AI is just starting, the ability of renewable firms to continue benefiting could be limited by a White House keen to boost fossil fuels and kill wind and solar.

Other clean technologies aren’t facing the same headwinds. Trump is an unabashed supporter of nuclear power, which is also seeing a rebound in public support. Geothermal today provides less than 1% of US generation capacity, but new drilling techniques and support from both tech giants and Energy Secretary Chris Wright have positioned it for growth.

Nuclear is an “ideal supply source for data centers,” and companies are willing to pay a premium for carbon-free, round-the-clock power, said David Brown, director of the energy transition practice at Wood Mackenzie.

Even before Trump took office for a second term, tech giants like Microsoft Corp. were seeking nuclear power. The company signed a deal with Constellation Energy Corp. last year for energy from the Three Mile Island plant, set to restart in 2027. Constellation struck a similar deal with Meta Platforms Inc. in June to sell power from an Illinois nuclear plant.

Almost a quarter of all venture funding for the US climate tech sector went to nuclear startups in the first half of this year, with firm TerraPower LLC closing the largest deal in the clean power sector at $650 million, according to BNEF. Funders include Bill Gates, who also founded the company, and Nvidia Corp.’s venture capital arm.

In addition, firms focusing on grid-enhancing technologies are also attracting funding, Osborne said. That includes startups like Veir Inc., which is making superconducting powerlines it thinks can solve the AI-fueled power crunch, and Heron Power Electronics Co., which signed a letter of intent to sell next-generation transformers to data center developer Crusoe in June.

A senior official said the Trump administration is working with states and utility regulators to speed data center development while looking to lift restrictions and roadblocks. These successes come as tax credits for some renewables are set to be wound down as part of Trump’s tax law.

“It is dangerous out there for a solar and wind company right now,” said Nancy Pfund, managing partner of impact investment firm DBL Partners and an early Tesla Inc. investor, adding that firms will need to cut costs and look at developing projects in other countries.

Altogether, companies canceled, closed or scaled back more than $22 billion in clean-energy investments during the first half of the year, according to research group E2. That’s about 17% of green projects announced since the start of 2022.

“Even though AI is a national priority for the Trump administration, the energy sector policies that the president has ultimately put forward threaten to slow down US momentum in AI,” Woodmac’s Brown said.

“The Trump administration is working with states and utility regulators to facilitate data center development, fostering a productive and symbiotic relationship among grid operators, developers, and hyperscalers,” a senior administration official said in an emailed statement. “This approach avoids imposing unreasonable or onerous restrictions on American tech companies at the forefront of AI development.”

While the Trump administration has created incentives for geothermal and nuclear, that support alone is not going to make those resources “readily available or plentiful in the next five years,” said Gabriel Kra, co-founder of climate tech venture capital firm Prelude Ventures. Both will take significant time and capital to get permitted and deployed at scale.

Nuclear power plants have historically faced long construction delays, permitting challenges and cost overruns. The last two nuclear reactors built in the US, Vogtle Units 3 and 4, took over a decade to get up and running, compared to utility-scale solar projects, which can be stood up in a year-and-a-half on average.

“The tools we have to scale are gas, solar, wind, batteries,” said Kra. And with natural gas turbine shortages, the hit to the renewables industry means “we just shut down the ability to produce cheap electricity for those customers who want to pay for it.”

For geothermal producer Ormat Technologies Inc., though, the policies in place are set to be a boon. Its shares have risen more than 29% so far this year, and the company has power purchase agreements with utilities and community choice aggregation programs in California. Ormat expects to finalize contracts to support data centers and hyperscalers in the “second half of the year and beyond,” Chief Executive Officer Doron Blachar said on an investor call on Thursday. He added the firm is benefitting from faster permitting timelines and quicker responses from the federal government due to recent regulatory reform.

By extending the production and investment tax credits for geothermal and energy storage, Trump’s legislation is “positioning us uniquely within the renewable energy sector,” Blachar said.

(AP) — With the explosive growth of Big Tech’s data centers threatening to overload U.S. electricity grids, policymakers are taking a hard look at a tough-love solution: bumping the energy-hungry data centers off grids during power emergencies.

Texas moved first, as state lawmakers try to protect residents in the data-center hotspot from another deadly blackout, like the winter storm in 2021 when dozens died.

Now the concept is emerging in the 13-state mid-Atlantic grid and elsewhere as massive data centers are coming online faster than power plants can be built and connected to grids. That has elicited pushback from data centers and Big Tech, for whom a steady power supply is vital.

Like many other states, Texas wants to attract data centers as an economic boon, but it faces the challenge of meeting the huge volumes of electricity the centers demand. Lawmakers there passed a bill in June that, among other things, orders up standards for power emergencies when utilities must disconnect big electric users.

That, in theory, would save enough electricity to avoid a broad blackout on the handful of days during the year when it is hottest or coldest and power consumption pushes grids to their limits or beyond.

Texas was first, but it won’t be the last, analysts say, now that the late 2022 debut of OpenAI’s ChatGPT ignited worldwide demand for chatbots and other generative AI products that typically require large amounts of computing power to train and operate.

“We’re going to see that kind of thing pop up everywhere,” said Michael Webber, a University of Texas engineering professor who specializes in energy. “Data center flexibility will be expected, required, encouraged, mandated, whatever it is.”

Data centers are threatening grids

That’s because grids can’t keep up with the fast-growing number of data center projects unfolding in Texas and perhaps 20 other states as the U.S. competes in a race against China for artificial intelligence superiority.

Grid operators in Texas, the Great Plains states and the mid-Atlantic region have produced eye-popping projections showing that electricity demand in the coming years will spike, largely due to data centers.

A proposal similar to Texas’ has emerged from the nation’s biggest grid operator, PJM Interconnection, which runs the mid-Atlantic grid that serves 65 million people and data-center hotspots in Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania.

The CEO of the Southwest Power Pool, which operates the grid that serves 18 million people primarily in Kansas, Oklahoma and other Great Plains states, said it has no choice but to expand power-reduction programs — likely for the biggest power users — to meet growing demand.

The proposals are cropping up at a time when electricity bills nationally are rising fast — twice the rate of inflation, according to federal data — and growing evidence suggests that the bills of some regular Americans are rising to subsidize the gargantuan energy needs of Big Tech.

Analysts say power plant construction cannot keep up with the growth of data center demand, and that something must change.

“Data center load has the potential to overwhelm the grid, and I think it is on its way to doing that,” said Joe Bowring, who heads Monitoring Analytics, the independent market watchdog in the mid-Atlantic grid.

Data centers might have to adjust

Big Tech is trying to make their data centers more energy efficient. They are also installing backup generators, typically fueled by diesel, to ensure an uninterrupted power supply if there’s a power outage.

Data center operators, however, say they hadn’t anticipated needing that backup power supply to help grid operators meet demand and are closely watching how utility regulators in Texas write the regulations.

The Data Center Coalition, which represents Big Tech companies and data center developers, wants the standards to be flexible, since some data centers may not be able to switch to backup power as easily or as quickly as others.

The grid operator also should balance that system with financial rewards for data centers that voluntarily shut down during emergencies, said Dan Diorio of the Data Center Coalition.

Nation’s largest grid operator has a proposal

PJM’s just-released proposal revolves around a concept in which proposed data centers may not be guaranteed to receive electricity during a power emergency.

That’s caused a stir among power plant owners and the tech industry.

Many questioned PJM’s legal authority to enforce it or warned of destabilizing energy markets and states scaring off investors and developers with uncertainty and risk.

“This is particularly concerning given that states within PJM’s footprint actively compete with other U.S. regions for data center and digital infrastructure investment,” the Digital Power Network, a group of Bitcoin miners and data center developers, said in written comments to PJM.

The governors of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Illinois and Maryland said they worried that it’s too unpredictable to provide a permanent solution and that it should at least be accompanied by incentives for data centers to build new power sources and voluntarily reduce electricity use.

Others, including consumer advocates, warned that it won’t lower electric bills and that PJM should instead pursue a “bring your own generation” requirement for data centers to, in essence, build their own power source.

A deal is shrouded in secrecy

In Indiana, Google took a voluntary route.

Last month, the electric utility, Indiana & Michigan Power, and the tech giant filed a power-supply contract with Indiana regulators for a proposed $2 billion data center planned in Fort Wayne in which Google agreed to reduce electricity use there when the grid is stressed. The data center would, it said, reduce electricity use by delaying non-urgent tasks to when the electric grid is under less stress.

However, important details are being kept from the public and Ben Inskeep of the Citizens Action Coalition, a consumer advocacy group, said that leaves it unclear how valuable the arrangement really is, if at all.

A new way of thinking about electricity

To an extent, bumping big users off the grid during high-demand periods presents a new approach to electricity.

It could save money for regular ratepayers, since power is most expensive during peak usage periods.

Abe Silverman, an energy researcher at Johns Hopkins University, said that data centers can and do use all the electricity they want on most days.

But taking data centers off the grid for those handful of hours during the most extreme heat or cold would mean not having to spend billions of dollars to build a bunch of power plants, he said.

“And the question is, is that worth it? Is it worth it for society to build those 10 new power plants just to serve the data centers for five hours a year?” Silverman said. “Or is there a better way to do it?”",https://www.power-eng.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AP25254502230745-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-09-15 20:01:13.764971

The office plans to award $6 million to the Western Piedmont Council of Governments and $4 million to a list of current WAP service providers.

DEQ hopes to serve more than 575 households with the program, according to a press release.

The funds can contribute to home repair for affected homes on the WAP deferral lists, where households were placed if a home needed major repairs or other work that was not eligible for existing funding.

“This new weatherization readiness funding is an important piece of the comprehensive effort to accelerate long-term recovery and strengthen energy resilience in communities hit hard by Helene,” DEQ Secretary Reid Wilson said. “These projects will drive down home utility bills and ensure safer, healthier and more energy-efficient homes for families who need it most.”

By making affected homes more energy efficient, DEQ is also helping to lower carbon emissions and reducing the strain on the electric grid,

As the state works to provide additional relief to those impacted families, Gov. Josh Stein made a request Monday to ask Congress for $13.5 billion towards Hurricane Helene recovery.

This allotment would contribute to restoring homes and small businesses, supporting local government services, and rebuilding roads and bridges.

Stein will travel to Washington on Wednesday to meet with federal officials about the plea.

The installation is one of three that supplies renewable energy to the Rhode Island electric grid, in exchange for utility bill credits for regional housing authorities, lowering their operating costs and ultimately lowering energy prices for public housing residents. Announced in 2021, the construction of the project is now complete, and all three solar installations are supplying green energy to the Rhode Island electric grid.

The collaboration between PHARI, Nautilus and Veolia is a first of its kind in the nation encompassing multiple public housing authorities under a single renewable energy contract. The Exeter Mail installation is the largest of three contracted by the housing authorities.

Combined, the three sites exceed 13 MW, removing approximately 4,800 metric tons of greenhouse gases annually, the equivalent of taking more than 1,000 cars off the road. The market value of the generation from the three projects will be distributed among nine housing authorities in Rhode Island (Providence, North Providence, Newport, Cranston, Smithfield, Warwick, Warren, Bristol and Lincoln) in the form of utility bill credits. The credits will generate a discount against prevailing electricity supply rates, which lowers the operating budgets of the housing authorities in a region with some of the highest energy costs in the U.S. , benefiting both taxpayers and public housing families.

Located primarily in the towns of Exeter and Smithfield, the solar fields provide approximately 20 million kilowatt hours annually. The projects are estimated to save over $35 million in energy costs over the next 20 years.

Nautilus has overseen the development, permitting and construction of the solar installation. The company will now look after the ongoing management, maintenance and performance for the life of the projects, estimated at 25 to 30 years. Leveraging its deep knowledge of decarbonization, power optimization, and solar generation, Veolia was selected by PHARI to serve as a buy-side agent for the collaboration of housing authorities to manage the procurement effort, advise technically and manage the complexity of the vendor selection process.

The energy generated from the projects now feeds into the electric utility territory of Rhode Island Energy, a subsidiary of PPL Corporation. The completion of the Exeter Mail 6.5 MW field, the third of three that were contracted, marks the conclusion of this project.

Karin Hamel, President and Chief Executive Officer of Veolia's Sustainable Industries and Buildings business said: ""Veolia is proud to contribute to this transformative solar installation, which not only harnesses the power of renewable energy but also directly supports the well-being of thousands of low-income families in Rhode Island. This project aligns with Veolia's GreenUp strategy. Producing local, low-carbon energy is a critical growth booster for accelerating ecological transformation. This project is a perfect example of how green energy can be used for good.""

Jeffrey Cheng, Chief Executive Officer of Nautilus Solar said: ""This solar installation marks an important milestone in our mission to make clean energy more accessible. By delivering the benefits of community solar directly to public housing residents, we're pioneering a model that supports renewable energy goals while delivering long-term economic benefits to the local community. Rhode Island continues to be a key state for innovation in clean energy access, and we're proud to continue growing our investment in the state while building stronger, more resilient communities.""

Robert Coupe, PHARI Co-President and Executive Director of Cranston Housing Authority said: ""Every housing authority in Rhode Island is working to provide the highest quality affordable housing possible with limited budgets. Our partnership with Veolia and Nautilus dramatically reduces utility costs, freeing up valuable resources to invest in property maintenance, facility improvements and operational support. By supporting the growth of renewable energy projects, we are improving the quality of life for future generations while enhancing our ability to serve current residents.""

Many electric vehicle (EV) drivers choose their cars to see long-term savings from cheaper fuel and lower maintenance costs. But the upfront cost of the vehicle can be more pricey than gas cars.

If you’re going to be in the market for an EV, here are three affordable ones that experts told GOBankingRates will be cheaper than gas cars by 2026.

2027 Chevrolet Bolt

According to Justin Fischer, an automotive expert at CarEdge.com, two EV originators are making a comeback in 2026, and both will set the new standard for affordable electric cars moving forward.

“With an expected starting price around $30,000, native support for the Tesla Supercharger network and much faster charging than the last generation, the Bolt EV will be an incredible value that beats gas-powered competitors by a long shot when it comes to total cost of ownership,” Fischer said. “In a compact package, the Bolt EV is likely to score well over 110 MPGe in EPA testing. Even the most efficient hybrids can’t get anywhere near that.”

2026 Nissan LEAF

The 2026 Nissan LEAF is a complete reinvention of the model that brought EVs to the masses in 2011, according to Fischer.

“Everything from the electric powertrain to the exterior styling is reimagined for 2026,”Fischer said. “For anyone familiar with the older generation LEAF, that’s probably welcome news. What’s more surprising is the low price.”

According to Fischer, the 2026 Nissan LEAF will start at $29,990, even with huge upgrades across the board. For those who can charge at home or work at affordable rates, the 2026 Nissan LEAF will be a top-value EV from day one, per Fischer.

Tesla Model 3

According to Melanie Musson, an auto industry expert with AutoInsurance.org, the Model 3 isn’t the cheapest EV on the market, but when you compare it to similar gas models, it’s priced competitively.

“The Model 3 is renowned for its reliability, resulting in a low cost of ownership,” Musson said. “As a result, owners can start saving money after a couple of years of lower-cost driving.”",https://cdn.gobankingrates.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/tesla-model-3-charging-outdoors_iStock-2205601105.jpg,N,,2025-09-15 17:01:40.863072

Real-world impact across the renewable stack The shift to edge-based data normalisation is already taking shape in renewable energy deployments, particularly in utility-scale solar and battery storage projects.
Andrew Foster is product director at open edge data platform, IOTech.","Before operators can optimise assets, forecast performance, or coordinate distributed energy resources (DERs) as part of a larger grid strategy, all that raw data must first be cleaned, contextualised and standardised. That may sound simple, but for many teams, this step remains one of the biggest time and cost sinks in modern renewables.

This is the messy middle that is holding up progress, and one that is now being tackled with a new tool: edge-based AI.

The hidden cost of unstructured data

Renewable energy assets are inherently distributed. Unlike centralised power plants, they are deployed across rooftops, utility-scale fields or integrated into community microgrids. Each asset might use a different vendor’s hardware, run slightly different firmware, or follow a slightly different naming convention for what appears to be the same data.

Even when asset owners are committed to aligning their systems with a standard like the SunSpec Alliance models for solar and storage, it is rarely a turnkey process. Getting a multi-vendor ecosystem to comply with these standards in practice involves hours of scripting, mapping, and manual tagging just to get a unified view.

That lack of structure has ripple effects across the ecosystem. Grid operators struggle to trust or ingest data that is inconsistent or incomplete. DERMS platforms and virtual power plant (VPP) aggregators spend weeks retrofitting each new site. Real-time analytics engines fail to generate meaningful insights without clean, labelled data. And project timelines are dragged down by the very thing meant to accelerate them: software.

The result is that messy data turns every clean energy deployment into a bespoke integration project. At scale, that is unsustainable.

Moving intelligence to the edge

To solve this, a new model is emerging, one where data is standardised before it leaves the site.

This is the promise of AI-driven semantic modelling at the edge. By embedding lightweight machine learning models into edge platforms located directly at or near the data source, renewable energy systems can now automatically identify, label and organise their data in real time.

Instead of sending raw data to the cloud for cleanup, edge AI infers what each data stream represents and aligns it with industry models such as SunSpec. This enables a new level of automation. Data arrives pre-structured, semantically tagged and immediately usable by upstream systems.

The shift from cloud-first to edge-first processing brings tangible benefits. Site deployment timelines shrink. Engineers spend less time writing custom integration scripts. DER fleets become easier to scale and manage.

A standards-based example: SunSpec at the edge

SunSpec is one of the most widely adopted standards in the solar and storage sectors. It provides a common information model for elements such as inverter status, power output, battery capacity and grid connectivity.

But aligning field data with SunSpec formats still requires manual work, especially when hardware diversity is high. Each device must map its native structures to SunSpec-compliant ones while ensuring that contextual metadata is properly attached. That is not a one-time task, either. It has to be maintained over time as systems evolve.

Edge AI offers a scalable alternative. With trained semantic models deployed on-site, edge platforms can:

Detect and classify incoming data streams from a variety of sources

Map values and fields to their appropriate SunSpec-defined representations

Normalise naming, structure and units across the board

This approach ensures that every new deployment speaks the same language as those before it. It reduces friction, speeds integration and delivers better data to the systems that rely on it.

Real-world impact across the renewable stack

The shift to edge-based data normalisation is already taking shape in renewable energy deployments, particularly in utility-scale solar and battery storage projects. These systems often span thousands of endpoints across a wide mix of vendors and configurations, making consistent data formatting a critical prerequisite for fast, scalable integration.

Operators are beginning to adopt edge AI techniques to automate semantic tagging and align operational data with models like SunSpec at the point of ingestion. This allows structured data to flow from edge devices into control systems and analytics platforms without requiring extensive post-processing.

Some edge platforms now embed this functionality out of the box, including commercial solutions based on open frameworks like EdgeX Foundry. For example, IOTech’s edge software includes built-in tools to support real-time data normalisation at scale, helping renewable energy providers manage diverse assets more efficiently while reducing integration time and manual effort.

By bringing semantic structure to the edge, these systems are enabling more reliable grid coordination, smoother DER integration, and faster onboarding across distributed energy fleets.

Why this matters now

The growth of renewable infrastructure is compounding the complexity of managing it. Operators are not thinking in terms of one or two assets. They are managing fleets. Aggregators are coordinating multi-site VPPs. Grid operators are dealing with bidirectional flows and unpredictable loads. In this landscape, data quality becomes a gating factor for innovation.

Without structure, interoperability breaks down. Without context, analytics falter. Without consistency, automation slows to a crawl.

That is why edge AI is such a timely advancement. It targets the problem where it begins, at the edge, and turns every data point into something trustworthy and usable from the start.

What comes next

The data challenges being addressed in solar and storage are not unique to renewables. The same fragmented, messy data problems appear in EV charging networks, smart buildings, and industrial facilities. The lesson is the same. Consistent, structured data is the foundation for everything else, including optimisation, forecasting, automation and compliance.

As the industry continues to coalesce around open models like SunSpec, Project Haystack and UNS/ISA-95, the question becomes how to apply these models at scale across heterogeneous environments.

Edge AI gives us a practical way to do that. Not as a bolt-on, but as a foundational capability of future energy infrastructure.

In 1H 2025, the sector installed 1 GW of solar installations, the largest first half ever.
Residential Solar Residential solar installations during Q2 were just over 1 GW, with high interest rates and economic uncertainty suppressing demand.
These costs increased in Q2 2025 following the government’s implementation of a 10% baseline tariff in April 2025.
The report’s base case broadly forecasts a 5% average annual decline in solar installations between 2025 and 2030, up from 2% in the Q1 2025 outlook.","The U.S. solar industry installed 7.5 GW of capacity in the second quarter (Q2) of 2025, a 24% year-over-year (YoY) and a 28% quarter-over-quarter (QoQ) decline, according to Wood Mackenzie and Solar Energy Industries Association‘s US Solar Market Insight report.

The report stated that all segments, except commercial solar, saw capacity additions declining. The commercial solar segment witnessed a strong project pipeline that continued to come online under California’s former net metering regime.

Utility-Scale and Commercial Solar

In Q2 2025, installations in the utility-scale segment stood at 5.7 GW, declining 28% YoY and 33% QoQ. In 2024, average solar prices earned by projects in Texas, the largest utility-scale solar market, declined by 50% from 2023.

In 2024, average power prices earned by solar projects were down over 50% YoY. This decline affected the economic viability of new projects. Contracting across the U.S. also declined. The country signed 4.5 GW of new capacity in Q2, a 26% YoY.

Solar projects in New York supported contracted volumes. The New York State Energy Research and Development Authority executed agreements for more than a dozen large-scale projects in May. These projects contributed to over 2 GW of clean energy across the state.

According to the report, the U.S. solar commercial market installed a capacity of 585 MW in Q2 2025, the second highest in history. States such as Illinois, New York, Massachusetts, and Pennsylvania recorded healthy volumes.

In 1H 2025, the sector installed 1 GW of solar installations, the largest first half ever. This increase was driven by projects under California’s NEM 2.0 program coming online. These projects accounted for over 90% of solar installations during this period.

Residential Solar

Residential solar installations during Q2 were just over 1 GW, with high interest rates and economic uncertainty suppressing demand. The bankruptcies of multiple solar companies also influenced the lower installation volumes.

The residential solar market added 1,064 MW of capacity, falling 9% YoY and 3% QoQ. The quarter witnessed the lowest capacity since Q2 2021, when it reduced to less than 1 GW. California, Florida, and Puerto Rico retained their lead in residential solar capacity rankings. California added approximately 275 MW, leading Florida by 200 MW.

In 1H2025, 33 states experienced a decrease in solar capacity from the previous year, resulting in a 12% YoY contraction.

Community Solar

The community solar segment installed 174 MW, a 52% YoY and a 34% QoQ decline, witnessing the lowest additions since Q1 2021. The segment’s volumes are reducing due to dwindling project pipelines in major markets with supportive policies. The report said no new markets are replacing these pipelines. Volumes for 1H 2025 decreased 36% YoY.

New York contributed heavily to the national contraction, with stagnating volumes during the quarter and capacities declining 56% YoY.

The report said that the U.S. has more than 9 GW of community solar in various stages of development as of Q2 2025. This development is likely to support the sector’s buildout through 2030.

Photovoltaic solar accounted for 56% of all new electricity-generating capacity additions in the first half (1H) of 2025. It remained the U.S.’ dominant form of new electricity-generating capacity.

OBBBA Impact

The OBBBA (Budget Reconciliation Bill), signed on July 4, 2025, introduced sweeping changes to the U.S. energy policy landscape. The report stated that changes to the tax credit across several technologies, along with the new Foreign Entities of Concern (FEOC) requirements, will be an inflection point for multiple power sector trends.

Under the new provisions, the solar sector will no longer have access to Section 48E and 45Y tax credits after 2027, or the Section 25D tax credits (for customer-owned residential solar) after 2025.

Currently, projects starting construction on or before July 4, 2026, must come online in four years to earn the tax credits. However, solar projects beginning construction after this date must be commissioned by the end of 2027 to qualify for the 48E and 45Y credits.

The project cost share not allowed for payment to entities of concern will be 40% in 2026 and will increase by 5% every year to 60% from 2030 onwards.

Guidance and Permitting Uncertainty

On July 15, the Department of the Interior issued a memorandum stating that the Secretary of the Interior would personally sign off on numerous types of federal permitting approvals for solar and wind projects.

On August 15, the Treasury issued new guidance changing the definition of “beginning of construction” for solar and wind projects that are utilizing federal tax credits.

Earlier, projects could begin construction in one of the following pathways under the previous definitions: incurring at least 5% of the project cost (Five Percent Safe Harbor) or commencing onsite or offsite “physical work of a significant nature” (Physical Work Test). Projects using either pathway had to be commissioned by the end of the calendar year, four years post the commencement of the project’s construction.

The new guidance, effective September 2, largely maintains these requirements. However, the guidance has now removed the Five Percent Safe Harbor criterion for projects with capacities over 1.5 MW. These projects must now adhere to the Physical Work Test.

The Physical Work Test offers fewer bright-line assessments compared to the Five Percent Safe Harbor. The reduced assessments can create uncertainties for solar projects with planned construction commencement post-September 2.

FEOC Effect on Solar Manufacturing

The solar industry continued to grow in Q2 2025, with module manufacturing capacity reaching 55.4 GW. This growth exceeds the yearly solar installations when the factories are running at full capacity.

The increasing cost from the tariffs and higher labor and utility costs mean the 45X tax credits are crucial for U.S. solar manufacturers. Even though the 45X tax credits were maintained, the recent FEOC mandates could pose a risk to these credits.

Rise in Solar System Pricing

Residential solar system pricing rose 2% YoY. These costs increased in Q2 2025 following the government’s implementation of a 10% baseline tariff in April 2025. Baseline tariffs remained in effect even while a 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs was announced. This contributed to cost increases throughout solar market segments.

The anti-dumping duty (AD) and countervailing duty (CVD) case on solar cells and modules from Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam, beginning in April last year and finalized in May 2025, pushed module prices by 13% YoY across distributed generation segments.

In August this year, the U.S. also initiated AD/CVD investigations against imports of crystalline silicon photovoltaic cells, whether or not assembled into modules, from India, Indonesia, and Laos.

Prices of residential systems averaged $3.36/W, increasing 2% over the previous year. Commercial system costs stood at $1.57/Wd, rising 10% YoY.

In Q2, utility-scale fixed-tilt and single-axis tracking system prices increased 4% YoY, reaching $1.11/W and $1.25/W, respectively. Engineering, procurement, and construction overhead, permitting, logistics, and miscellaneous costs rose 30% YoY on average.

Total utility-scale project system costs increased during the quarter compared to Q2 2024, despite a yearly average decrease of 10% in solar module and inverter prices.

Five-Year Forecast

The report projects 246 GW of solar installations in the next five years.

New installations are projected to surge in 2027, with projects hurrying to meet the tax credit deadline.

Approximately 50 GW of solar installations are projected to begin construction before the end of 2025. Another 40 GW of projects are likely to start construction in 1H 2026.

The report’s base case broadly forecasts a 5% average annual decline in solar installations between 2025 and 2030, up from 2% in the Q1 2025 outlook.

Wood Mackenzie expects the OBBBA to also result in fewer new manufacturing facilities being commissioned in the coming quarters.

The residential solar segment is also expected to rush to install projects before the year’s end due to the expiry of 25D tax credits for it. However, the total installed capacity is unlikely to exceed the record-breaking volumes of 2024.

Commercial and community solar developers are projected to safe harbor equipment or commence physical work to the extent possible.

Between 2025 and 2030, the national commercial solar market is expected to grow at an annual average rate of 3%. Near-term growth is forecasted to remain steady through 2026 since most projects are already under construction or in interconnection queues.

States such as California, with its strong growth, is still witnessing projects under NEM 2.0 taking longer than initially forecasted to come online. Wood Mackenzie projects that the state’s commercial solar installations will continue to grow throughout 2025, with a dip in 2H 2026.

The report said the federal policy changes have reduced the community solar sector’s five-year outlook to 8% compared to Q2 2025.

The community solar market is forecasted to contract by an annual average of 12% through 2030. Multiple state markets have proposed community solar programs. However, stakeholders have struggled to finalize legislation so far. The early expiration of the Investment Tax Credit and the potential cancellation of the Environmental Protection Agency’s $7 billion “Solar for All” funding are expected to further complicate the design of frameworks for community solar in these states.

Despite the continued growth of successful community solar programs in Illinois, Maryland, and New Jersey, Wood Mackenzie projects a 29% market correction this year.

Wood Mackenzie’s base case projects 168 GW of added utility-scale solar capacity between 2025 and 2030.

Approximately 44 GW of planned capacity is projected to be affected by the DOI’s directive. States such as Arizona, California, Utah, and Nevada are likely to be the most impacted.

The report also presents a low-case solar development forecast in addition to its base-case forecast for the quarter to benchmark the possible outcomes of the recent policy developments. This forecast projects an 18% downside risk (44 GW).

In a more constrained permitting environment, the report forecasts a 30% decrease in the commissioning of solar projects in 2026 and 2027 compared to the base case scenario. The differential between the two forecasts reduces from 2028. In the low case, it averages 17% less capacity from this period onwards.

Increased demand for new energy supply and rising power prices are projected to strengthen market fundamentals in the long term. The report’s low case is 18% lower than the base case over the next five years.",https://d382rz2cea0pah.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Copy-of-Mercom-FI-2025-08-29T162119.578.jpg,N,,2025-09-15 19:00:40.759664

U.S.-based shipping companies, however, have endorsed it. The Chamber of Shipping of America wants one global system, not multiple regional systems that could double charge vessels for their emissions depending on the route, said Kathy Metcalf, the chamber’s president emeritus.

Shipping emissions have grown over the last decade to about 3% of the global total as vessels have gotten bigger, delivering more cargo per trip and using immense amounts of fossil fuels. The IMO, which regulates international shipping, set a target for the sector to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by about 2050, and has committed to ensuring that fuels with zero or near-zero emissions are used more widely.

In April, IMO member states agreed on the contents of a regulatory framework to impose a minimum fee for every ton of greenhouse gases emitted by ships above certain thresholds and set a marine fuel standard to phase in cleaner fuels. The IMO aims for consensus in decision-making but, in this case, had to vote. The United States was notably absent.

Now nations have to decide if the regulations will enter into force in 2027. If agreed upon, the regulations will become mandatory for large oceangoing ships over 5,000 gross tonnage, which emit 85% of the total carbon emissions from international shipping, according to the IMO.

If nations don’t agree, shipping’s decarbonization will be further delayed and “the chance of the sector playing a proper and fair part in the fight to keep global heating below dangerous levels will almost certainly be lost,” said Delaine McCullough, president of the Clean Shipping Coalition and Ocean Conservancy shipping program director.

The U.S. secretaries said in their statement that “fellow IMO members should be on notice” the U.S. will “not hesitate to retaliate or explore remedies for our citizens” if they do not support the United States, against this action. They said ships will have to pay fees for failing to meet “unattainable fuel standards and emissions targets,” driving up costs, and the fuel standards would “conveniently benefit China.” China is a leader in developing and producing cleaner fuels for shipping.

While U.S. opposition and pressure cannot be taken for granted, it still appears as though a majority of countries currently support the regulations, said Faig Abbasov from Transport and Environment, a Brussels-based environmental nongovernmental organization. Abbasov said the deal reached in April was not ambitious enough, but this is an opportunity to launch the sector’s decarbonization and it can be strengthened.

Shipping companies want the regulations because it gives them the certainty needed to confidently make investments in cleaner technologies, such as fuels that are alternatives to fossil fuels and the ships that run on them. In addition to the Getting to Zero Coalition, the International Chamber of Shipping, which represents over 80% of the world’s merchant fleet, is advocating for adoption when nations meet at IMO Headquarters in London from Oct. 14 to 17.

Workload Flexibility and Grid Innovation The demand-response strategy is uniquely suited to AI data centers because of workload diversity.

By agreeing to curtail loads during peak demand, data centers can be granted faster interconnection approvals since they present less risk to overall system stability.
That shift could ripple across data center site selection, power purchase agreements, and the economics of interconnection.","Last month, Google signed agreements with two U.S. electric utilities, American Electric Power (AEP) utility Indiana Michigan Power and Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), to reduce power consumption at its AI data centers to ease strain on the U.S. power grid during times of surging demand.

They’re the first formal agreements by Google in demand-response programs with utilities—a way to temporarily reduce electricity usage during peak hours—to temporarily curtail its machine learning (ML) workloads, a subset of AI.

AI data centers are flooding U.S. utilities with electricity requests, pushing demand beyond available supply in some regions. The resulting power strain is raising fears of higher bills for households and businesses, along with potential blackouts.

The demand/availability conflict also has complicated the technology industry's expansion of AI, which requires massive amounts of electricity quickly.

""It allows large electricity loads like data centers to be interconnected more quickly, helps reduce the need to build new transmission and power plants, and helps grid operators more effectively and efficiently manage power grids,"" Michael Terrell, Google Head of Advanced Energy said in an August 4 blog post.

“These agreements represent the first time we’re delivering data center demand-response by targeting machine learning (ML) workloads,” he continued. “This builds on our successful demonstration with Omaha Public Power District (OPPD), where we reduced the power demand associated with ML workloads during three grid events last year—paving the way for us to pursue opportunities at other locations.”

However, although this industry-leading strategy is innovative, not every task can be paused. Some critical functions, such as Google Search, Maps, and services used by healthcare or cloud customers, can’t be interrupted. Google representatives acknowledged that demand flexibility will only be implemented at certain locations, and only where service reliability won’t be compromised.

I&M serves more than 600,000 customers. The new contract is designed to support its capacity needs through clean power generation, supporting its ability to provide reliable service and help lower overall energy costs for customers.

AEP is one of the nation's largest electricity producers with approximately 29,000 MW of diverse generating capacity.

Transmission and Power Strategy

These agreements build on Google’s growing set of strategies to manage electricity needs.

In June of 2025, Google announced a deal with CTC Global to upgrade transmission lines with high-capacity composite conductors that increase throughput without requiring new towers. In July 2025, Google and Brookfield Asset Management unveiled a hydropower framework agreement worth up to $3 billion, designed to secure firm clean energy for data centers in PJM and Eastern markets.

Alongside renewable deals, Google has signed nuclear supply agreements as well, most notably a landmark contract with Kairos Power for small modular reactor capacity. Each of these moves reflects Google’s effort to create more headroom on the grid while securing firm, carbon-free power.

Workload Flexibility and Grid Innovation

The demand-response strategy is uniquely suited to AI data centers because of workload diversity. Machine learning training runs can sometimes be paused or rescheduled, unlike latency-sensitive workloads.

This flexibility allows Google to throttle certain compute-heavy processes in coordination with utilities. In practice, Google can preemptively pause or shift workloads when notified of peak events, ensuring critical services remain uninterrupted while still creating significant grid relief.

Local Utility Impact

For utilities like I&M and TVA, partnering with hyperscale customers has a dual benefit: stabilizing the grid while keeping large customers satisfied and growing within their service territories.

It also signals to regulators and ratepayers that data centers, often criticized for their heavy energy footprint, can actively contribute to reliability. These agreements may help avoid contentious rate cases or delays in permitting new power plants.

Policy, Interconnection Queues, and the Economics of Speed

One of the biggest hurdles for data center development today is the long wait in interconnection queues. In regions like PJM Interconnection, developers often face waits of three to five years before new projects can connect to the grid. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) filings show similar delays across multiple regions, as utilities and grid operators struggle to process unprecedented volumes of requests.

Demand-response agreements like Google’s offer a potential workaround. By agreeing to curtail loads during peak demand, data centers can be granted faster interconnection approvals since they present less risk to overall system stability. This demand flexibility can effectively “buy time” for utilities to complete needed transmission upgrades without forcing developers into indefinite delays.

The economics of such deals often involve capacity payments or bill reductions. In some cases, utilities compensate large customers for agreeing to be interruptible loads, either through reduced rates or direct payments during grid events. For Google, this creates both a cost-saving opportunity and a reputational benefit: helping the grid while accelerating the timeline for new capacity to come online.

Industry Implications

Google’s participation could set a precedent for how AI-driven companies interact with the grid. If hyperscale operators normalize demand-response as part of their standard operations, utilities may increasingly expect—or even require—similar commitments from other large energy users. That shift could ripple across data center site selection, power purchase agreements, and the economics of interconnection.

For now, Google’s agreements with I&M and TVA remain early pilots. But if they prove successful, they could reshape the conversation about balancing AI growth with grid reliability in the United States and beyond.","https://img.datacenterfrontier.com/files/base/ebm/datacenterfrontier/image/2025/09/68c841e499e9905b4cec0530-dreamstime_xxl_87755795.png?auto=format,compress&fit=fill&fill=blur&w=1200&h=630",N,,2025-09-15 14:01:49.987798

Dive Brief:

Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin announced Friday that the agency will propose a rule to eliminate the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program, or GHGRP, which requires over 8,000 companies and entities to calculate and annually report their greenhouse gas emissions for 47 source categories.

The agency estimated that the rule would save U.S. companies “up to $2.4 billion” in regulatory costs, according to the announcement. EPA said in a fact sheet that if the proposal is finalized, companies would not have to submit reports with 2025 data.

Zeldin previously telegraphed Friday’s proposal in the spring, when EPA announced a spate of climate and environmental rules it was planning to reconsider during a “day of deregulation” at the agency. Repealing the GHG Reporting Program could hurt the carbon capture industry and remove data that cities rely on to hold polluters accountable.

Dive Insight:

The Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program was established in 2009, after Congress mandated a GHG reporting rule in response to the appropriations act for the 2008 fiscal year, according to EPA. The program currently applies to certain large industrial facilities that emit 25,000 metric tons or more of carbon dioxide equivalent, as well as carbon dioxide injection sites and fuel and industrial gas suppliers, according to a March fact sheet.

EPA is proposing to rescind the GHGRP in accordance with executive orders President Donald Trump issued on his first day back in office. The agency said it plans to maintain its statutory obligations under the Clean Air Act, but claimed in the release that the GHGRP “is not directly related to a potential regulation and has no material impact on improving human health and the environment,” unlike other mandatory data collection programs under the CAA.

Zeldin said in the Sept. 12 announcement that the program “costs American businesses and manufacturing billions of dollars, driving up the cost of living, jeopardizing our nation’s prosperity and hurting American communities.”

The substance of the proposed rule would be an amendment to the program that removes “program obligations for most source categories,” according to the rule released for public inspection on Monday. The proposal, which would remove reporting requirements for carbon dioxide injection sites, “most large facilities” and all suppliers of fuel and industrial gas, will be published in the Federal Register on Tuesday.

The proposed rule would remove 46 of the 47 greenhouse gas source categories from the program. The agency would leave emissions reporting requirements for companies subject to the waste emissions charge, a methane emissions fee established by the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. But, the recent Congressional Republican budget bill will delay data collection under that subsection for petroleum and natural gas systems — required to report under the CAA — until it reports on calendar year 2034.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/XtAzP_3TXhHmYqJGbKWtmqyhY-d7qxOTC_Do57KmKYY/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0xMzYwMjQxNzg2X3E3VWt0UnouanBn.webp,N,,2025-09-15 14:01:27.344312

The Getting to Zero Coalition, an alliance of companies, governments and intergovernmental organizations, is asking member states of the International Maritime Organization to support adopting regulations to transition to green shipping, including the fee, when they meet in London next month. The statement was shared exclusively with The Associated Press in advance.

The project has been slated to begin construction in 2026. If completed, Maryland’s offshore wind project, developed by U.S. Wind, has the potential to power 718,000 homes. 2,680 new stable, well-paying jobs are also now in peril due to this announcement.

Despite multiple studies showing that states with the most renewable energy see the slowest—if any—rise in energy costs, the Trump administration has launched an all-out assault on offshore wind. In April, the administration issued a stop work order on the Empire Wind project in New York. This order was eventually reversed after costing the developer $50 million a week. Two weeks ago, Revolution Wind in Rhode Island received a similar order.

In response, Sierra Club Maryland Chapter Director Josh Tulkin issued the following response:

“The Maryland offshore wind project will provide good jobs, lower our energy bills, and help clean our air. By trying to derail this project, the Trump administration is withholding these benefits from Maryland families and residents, effectively leaving the solution to our energy and economic needs stranded in the water.

“The Atlantic coast has a wealth of wind waiting to be harnessed. We will continue to speak out and demand better for our state, championing clean, homegrown energy that prioritizes people over polluters.”

Sierra Club Senior Advisor Nancy Pyne added:

“Donald Trump is throwing a temper tantrum that's costing Americans cleaner air and lower electricity bills. Despite constantly talking about lowering prices for hardworking Americans and establishing energy dominance in the U.S., Donald Trump’s only real concern is how much profit fossil fuel companies are making. By attacking offshore wind in every way possible, Donald Trump is forcing Americans to rely on expensive and deadly gas and coal, while padding the profits of dirty polluters.

“Offshore wind development in the United States has already allowed hundreds of thousands of families to reliably and affordably power their homes without having to sacrifice their health.

It’s all a part of Sun Day, the first-ever nationwide day of action calling for the large-scale deployment of clean energy that is affordable, reliable, and ready to go.

Chicago’s Sun Day Solar Fest, near Montrose Beach from noon to 4 p.m., will include live demonstrations, valuable resources, dynamic speakers, live music, spontaneous flashmob dances, sing-alongs, a puppet parade, an electric vehicle show, and more.

Joining Third Act and 350 Chicago in supporting the event are more than 30 other organizations — including the Active Transportation Alliance — representing environmental and transportation action and justice, residential and community solar groups, as well as major universities and cultural institutions.

A CHANCE TO RISE UP FOR A SUN-POWERED PLANET

Timed to coincide with the fall equinox, Sun Day comes as the clean energy transition approaches a tipping point. Solar power is now the cheapest form of energy on the planet, clean energy jobs are growing rapidly, and communities across the country are experiencing the benefits of cleaner air and lower energy costs.

But powerful fossil fuel interests are working overtime to preserve the status quo. And the federal government has greatly reduced programs and incentives for solar, wind, and other renewable energy investments.

Bill McKibben, noted environmentalist, author, and a founder of Third Act and 350.org, reminds us that Americans have long thought of solar and wind as “alternative” energy, “the Whole Foods of energy: nice but pricey.” He says it’s time to think of it as “the Costco of energy: cheap, on the shelf, and available in bulk, ready to go.”

THE SUN CAN POWER THE WORLD, YOU CAN POWER A MOVEMENT

Solar power is affordable. It’s the cheapest way to power your home or business – most systems pay for themselves within a few years and can bring energy bills down.

Global solar capacity has grown more than tenfold in the past decade. It’s now the fastest growing energy source in the world.

The clean energy sector now employs millions of workers in the United States, creating sustainable jobs and economic growth in communities everywhere.

A solar system can provide your home with cheap and clean energy for decades. While traditional power grids fail during storms and emergencies, solar panels and the batteries they charge keep the lights on when you need them most.

Communities that get most of their power from solar energy report fewer asthma attacks, clearer skies, and quieter neighborhoods – clean energy improves lives in ways you can actually feel.

Installing solar roof panels is one of the best things you can do for your family’s health and future – they produce no air pollution or greenhouse gases during operation, improve local air quality, and reduce your carbon footprint.

So walk, run, bike, or CTA your way to the Sun Day Solar Fest on Sunday, September 21, at Montrose Beach near the dog park.

On July 29, the EPA proposed to not only repeal regulations limiting greenhouse gas emissions from new motor vehicles, but also to rescind the so-called ""endangerment finding""—the legal predicate for nearly all of the EPA's greenhouse gas regulations under the Clean Air Act. In this regard, the EPA is not seeking merely to undo regulations from the Obama and Biden administrations. It is also seeking to make it more difficult for future administrations to put such regulations back in place unless and until the EPA is instructed to do so by Congress. This is a high-risk strategy. . . .

The primary reason it is difficult to undo the endangerment finding is that the statutory standard is so easy to meet. For purposes of the Act, the question is not whether climate change is catastrophic, nor whether climate adaptation is preferable to mitigation, nor whether federal regulation of sector-specific emissions is rational or cost-beneficial, nor whether such regulations represent a serious or rational way to address the threat of climate change. Nor is the question whether the science is unequivocal, nor is it whether there is certainty about the likely effects of increased atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gas emissions over any given time period. Rather, the question is simply whether the EPA Administrator can ""reasonably anticipate"" that the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere can have negative effects on health or welfare—effects which the Act defines to include the impact on climate, ""economic values,"" and ""personal comfort and well-being.""

While the EPA suggests that a less-alarmist interpretation of existing climate science is one reason to undo the endangerment finding, relying upon a draft report prepared for the Department of Energy, its primary argument is that the Clean Air Act ""does not authorize the EPA to proscribe emission standards to address global climate change concerns."" The problem is that this argument is almost certainly foreclosed by Massachusetts v. EPA, which expressly concluded that the Act ""authorizes EPA to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from new motor vehicles in the event that it forms a 'judgment' that such emissions contribute to climate change."" The EPA suggests one way to address this constraint is to note that domestic motor vehicle emissions are a small (and shrinking) share of global emissions, but Section 202 of the Clean Air Act (unlike some other provisions of the Act) conspicuously lacks any requirement that motor vehicle emissions contribute significantly to the problem.",https://reason.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/cropped-rinsquareRGB-32x32.png,N,,2025-09-15 13:05:52.152238

“The Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program is nothing more than bureaucratic red tape that does nothing to improve air quality,” said EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin in a statement announcing the proposal.
The EPA had previously announced its intention to repeal the so-called “endangerment finding” that enabled it to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles and other sources.

“The Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program is nothing more than bureaucratic red tape that does nothing to improve air quality,” said EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin in a statement announcing the proposal.

“Instead, it costs American businesses and manufacturing billions of dollars, driving up the cost of living, jeopardizing our nation’s prosperity and hurting American communities,” he said.

“With this proposal, we show once again that fulfilling EPA’s statutory obligations and powering the great American comeback is not a binary choice,” Zeldin added.

The agency said the mandatory collection of GHG emissions data from the approximately 8,000 facilities that had been subject to the reporting requirement was unnecessary because it is “not directly related to a potential regulation and has no material impact on improving human health and the environment.”

The agency’s action is the latest in a series of regulatory moves stemming from executive orders signed by President Donald Trump aimed at removing barriers to the development of the United States’ fossil fuel resources.

The EPA had previously announced its intention to repeal the so-called “endangerment finding” that enabled it to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles and other sources.

Currently, the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program requires 47 source categories covering 8,000 facilities and suppliers to calculate and submit their greenhouse gas emissions annually.

The government has been collecting the data since 2010, previously seeing it as a tool to track carbon dioxide, methane and other emissions believed to be accelerating climate change.

If the agency’s latest proposal is finalized, it would eliminate reporting obligations for all of these entities as well as CO2 injection sites.

Zeldin has predicted that ending the program would save American businesses up to $2.4 billion in compliance costs.

“The key challenge facing oil companies today isn’t just optimizing current operations,” Sarah notes.
Sarah led the development of SaaS solutions and offshore applications, learning how to bridge traditional energy operations with digital technology.
Sarah’s background in both energy industry and strategic consulting gives her an edge when helping companies navigate major changes.","Global energy investment will reach a record $3.3 trillion in 2025, with clean energy spending hitting $2.2 trillion – more than double the $1.1 trillion projected for oil and gas, according to the International Energy Agency’s latest World Energy Investment report. This marks the first time clean energy investments significantly outpace fossil fuel spending. Solar power alone will attract $450 billion in investment, making it the single largest category. Meanwhile, upstream oil investment faces its first decline since the COVID crisis, dropping 6% due to lower prices and weakening demand expectations.

Major oil companies are responding with dramatic strategic shifts. Recent industry moves show the variety of paths being chosen: some companies are doubling down on traditional operations, other companies divest hydrocarbons assets to invest heavily in renewables, while others retreat from renewable commitments they made just years ago. Against this backdrop of industry uncertainty, Sarah Fluzin, a management consultant with deep energy sector expertise, recently completed a transformation project that will save a major oil company several billion dollars by 2030. The project focused on identifying operational inefficiencies that had accumulated over decades. Sarah’s team analyzed everything from maintenance schedules to supply chain logistics, finding that many processes were designed for favourable and steady market conditions. More than a decade in the energy industry across the value chain and in companies such as ExxonMobil gave her insight into how energy companies operate – understanding which systems are critical and which create unnecessary bottlenecks. This operational knowledge proved crucial when designing changes that wouldn’t disrupt production.

Multi-Billion Dollar Project

The upstream transformation required a complete redesign of operational models across several business units. For one of the largest Energy players worldwide, Sarah led analyst teams for nine months, identifying bottlenecks and inefficiencies accumulated over decades. The project included an analysis of over 200 operational processes and an efficiency assessment of 20+ major production assets.

“We looked at everything from people and productivity to technology in operations and maintenance”, Sarah explains. “Many companies are still working in a way designed for oil at $100 per barrel while they would need to adapt to be profitable at $60 per barrel. The main savings generally come from productivity improvements, enabled by process optimization and technology”.

The savings target matches industry pressure to optimize operations.. Industry analysis shows companies increase focus on capital discipline and operational improvements to maintain profitability despite volatile oil prices.

Sarah’s approach goes beyond spreadsheet optimization. During her time at SBM Offshore, she led the development of an in-house application for managing offshore personnel. The system was needed because existing manual processes for tracking offshore workers certifications, shift schedules, and safety compliance were creating bottlenecks or potential safety risks during crew changes on offshore platforms.

Sarah developed a phased implementation plan that avoided operational disruptions during the digital transformation. Rather than implementing across all assets simultaneously, the team tested changes on two pilot facilities before scaling up.

Strategic Leadership Across Global Markets

Management consulting assignments took Sarah from Middle East to African private and public energy entities. One project involved helping a key GCC country develop a plan to hit ambitious renewable energy targets without hurting their oil-dependent economy. The challenge: how do you promise 50% renewable energy by 2030 when oil exports fund 80% of government spend?

“The key challenge facing oil companies today isn’t just optimizing current operations,” Sarah notes. “You need to build systems and capabilities that work across different price scenarios while preparing for long-term market shifts.”

Sarah’s work at AlixPartners, in the aeronautical sector acquisitions taught her to evaluate complex technical businesses quickly. When private equity firms consider buying aerospace companies, they need someone who can assess both the engineering capabilities and market positioning within weeks, not months.

One project involved due diligence for an aviation company with €800 million in revenue. Sarah analyzed strategy, operational and financial data, as well as market trends and competitor landscape. The work required understanding aviation regulatory requirements, manufacturing processes, and market dynamics – due diligence being a typical methodology that can be transposed to most industries, including the energy sector.

Having worked in multiple countries, gives Sarah insight into different business cultures. “In the Middle East, relationships have an important role to guarantee successful business partnership, then business,” she explains. “You could come up with a very sophisticated or efficient solution, but if you haven’t invested time in understanding local priorities and building trust with key stakeholders, the project might not reach the expected outcomes.”

The Gulf sustainability project took 18 months and required managing expectations from multiple entities. Sarah’s team had to balance ambitious environmental targets with realistic economic constraints. The final strategy included specific timelines, budget allocations, and performance metrics that satisfied both environmental advocates and economic planners.

From ExxonMobil to Management Consulting

Fifteen years in the Energy space gave Sarah a deep understanding of upstream and downstream operations before joining the consulting world. Her engineering degree provided technical foundations, while her MBA from HEC Paris added business strategy skills needed for senior consulting roles.

Sarah worked across the energy value chain, from Upstream to Downstream, the latter on refining operations and onshore mega projects.

The transition to digital project management proved crucial. Sarah led the development of SaaS solutions and offshore applications, learning how to bridge traditional energy operations with digital technology. This combination makes her effective at helping companies adopt new tools without disrupting critical operations.

Moving from operational roles to strategic consulting happened when Sarah saw the energy sector entering fundamental change. Companies needed advisors who understood both technical complexity and the business implications of transformation as well as the ability to contemplate innovative and inclusive business models, more aligned with environmental goals while leading on society major shifts such as AI.

“After 15 years in oil and gas, I felt I needed to renew myself and keep the learning going,” she explains. “I also assumed strict technical skills were not enough anymore. Companies needed people who could think strategically about business models, not just optimize existing processes. That’s why I decided to get an MBA – I needed to understand the businesses more holistically, think through new perspectives, understand how to think about transformations, prepare for the future versus solely applying skills to optimize operations and projects.”

Sarah managed operations teams of up to 50 engineers and coordinated brownfield projects worth several millions in capital expenditure. This experience with large-scale project management translates directly to her current consulting work, where she often leads transformation initiatives affecting thousands of employees.

Recognition and Market Impact

Sarah serves as a judge for Globee Awards, evaluating strategic excellence across different industries. This role positions her alongside other senior professionals who assess business transformation initiatives and innovative approaches to complex challenges.

A leading management consulting firm promoted Sarah to manager level after she demonstrated consistent results on complex projects. Top-tier consulting firms typically require 3-4 years of exceptional performance for such advancement. Sarah’s background in both energy industry and strategic consulting gives her an edge when helping companies navigate major changes.

Sustainability Focus

Sarah works on sustainability projects. She’s considering further academic studies in micro and nano-plastics – an area where she has strong interest.

Oil investment drops 6% this year, according to the IEA. Companies need to squeeze more profit from existing operations while preparing for an uncertain future. Sarah’s projects help them do both: optimize what they have now and build capabilities for whatever comes next.

Personal investments in environmental initiatives show Sarah understands where the industry is heading. Companies that ignore environmental requirements risk losing access to capital and markets in the coming years.

The sustainability work reflects broader industry recognition that environmental factors will increasingly drive business decisions. Sarah’s dual expertise in business optimization and sustainability strategy positions her uniquely for this evolving landscape.",https://energiesmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/real_3beb2d4e-7ec4-4542-91e8-32e4800e6227.jpeg,N,,2025-09-15 13:05:04.394242

Indeed, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced a month later that the program was being frozen.

However, the program has been revised and stations are still being built under its purview.

It seems reasonable to assume that sometime between his January 20 executive order “Unleashing American Energy”—with its Section 1, “to eliminate the ‘electric vehicle mandate’ and promote true consumer choice”—and the end of EV tax credits after September 30, President Trump would have found a way to kill the $5 billion National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Formula Program (NEVI) Congress adopted as part of President Biden’s bipartisan infrastructure program in 2022.

Trump’s first-day EO prompted us to ask the Federal Highway Administration via email how many EV charging stations the NEVI program had built up to the point of that ominous executive order.

In May of the previous year, we reported that the program, then two years old, had yielded just eight chargers across the US.

As of August 27, there are 110 stations (about 500 charging ports) built by NEVI funding, as tracked in the station locater database according to the Federal Highway Administration.

That response came seven months after we asked the question.

“We’re going to see quite a flood of construction,” a person familiar with the program told Autoweek in September. This source believes the program will build a total of 200 stations by the end of the year, for about 1000 individual chargers.

After Trump’s January 20 EO, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy in February announced the program was being frozen. In June, a federal judge ruled the Transportation Department had exceeded its authority in putting an end to the congressionally funded program.

That sort of judicial ruling hasn’t meant much elsewhere for the Trump White House. June also was the month when the House approved a $9 billion rescission package demanded by the president that included the high-profile cut of $1.1 billion to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting for the current fiscal year and for 2026.

Instead of calling on Congress to do the same for NEVI, Trump jump-started NEVI last August 11, with Duffy saying, “if Congress is requiring the federal government to support charging stations, let’s cut the waste and do it right.”

“Support from states that challenged the freeze also played a role in its prompting the restart and updated guidance,” Stephanie Valdez Streaty, industry insights director and a specialist in the EV and electrified vehicle segments for Cox Automotive, told Autoweek.

The NEVI program requires states to supplement the federal funds allocated for EV charging station construction.

Duffy and the FHWA launched a review of the program’s guidance earlier this year to make NEVI more efficient. At the time, according to the FHWA, 84% of the NEVI Formula program funds remained unobligated, which the administration took as a “clear signal” of the program’s failure.

“NEVI was established to fund states’ deployment of EV charging infrastructure,” Duffy said, “but Biden and (former Transportation Secretary Pete) Buttigieg added requirements that were difficult to understand and implement.”

The FHWA directs all states to submit updated plans, which once approved, can resume NEVI funding, the agency says.

This new guidance retains the $1 billion-per-year funding of the program through the current year and through 2026.

Six states already have federal approval for their plans to build more EV charging stations in 2026, according to the National Association of State Energy Officials’ (NASEO) EV States Clearinghouse.

According to NASEO’s EV clearinghouse, 44 states have issued at least one solicitation for federal funds, 38 states have issued awards to build stations, and 16 states have at least one operational station. States have awarded $544 million in funding to complement the $3.3 billion in federal funding allocated from 2022 to 2025.

While EV federal tax credits end September 30 (though the “leasing loophole” allows consumers to take delivery of an EV after that date and still get the tax credit if they make at least their first payment by then) the auto industry is not backing off a fossil fuel-free future.

Urgency over the end of the tax credit from the One Big Beautiful tax and spending bill passed early this summer has given a big boost to the EV segment. General Motors, the number-two EV purveyor in the US, said it sold a record 21,000 Chevrolet, GMC and Cadillac EVs in August, while Cox Automotive says strong EV sales from all brands in the US market in July and August will result in full third-quarter sales when September is counted that will easily break the current record of 356,000 sold in the fourth quarter of 2024.

The other significant rule of the “EV mandate” that Trump cut with his January 20 executive order is the Biden administration Environmental Protection Agency standard meant to boost electric vehicle sales to 30%-56% by 2030-32. While EV market share is very likely to be significantly lower than 30% in five years, the extension of the federal charging station program, which addresses a top concern of EV ownership by American consumers, should guarantee continued electric vehicle growth.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/I4s4HuwCJDp5vwyjkQGp8A--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/autos.autoweek.com/7eb6c789e37190566e810c33000540e1,N,,2025-09-15 15:01:05.577132

This year, Arizona, Arkansas, Louisiana, Utah and West Virginia have all passed laws that will ban foods containing certain dyes and additives from school meals.
But implementing a ban on UPFs in California school meals will take more work than simply defining UPFs, food policy experts say.","California has long led the way on school meals. In 2022, it became the first state in the country to make school meals free for all students, regardless of income. Many districts have implemented farm-to-school programs to bring local foods into the cafeteria. And last year, months before the “Make America healthy again” movement would make its way to the White House, it became the first state in the nation to ban six synthetic food dyes from school meals.

This week, it passed legislation that will put it in the lead on school meals in yet another way – banning ultra-processed foods. On Friday, California lawmakers passed a bill that will define, and then ban, ultra-processed foods from school meals. The legislation, which must now be signed by the governor, Gavin Newsom, is believed to include the first statutory definition of ultra-processed foods in the world.

“We have so far found a formula that we think works and can help guide the national conversation on these issues,” said California state assembly member Jesse Gabriel, who sponsored the bill. That formula, he said, is “bipartisan, common sense, science-based”.

Ultra-processed foods, or UPFs, are industrially formulated products that are often high in fats, starches, sugars and additives, and make up 73% of the US food supply today. Think fast food, microwave dinners, sodas, chips, and even packaged bread and sweetened yoghurts.

Although nutritionists have been talking about UPFs for more than a decade, the US health secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr – a longtime pseudoscience proponent – made them a household term through his “Make America healthy again” coalition. While the federal government has yet to take any significant steps to rein in UPFs – Kennedy’s rhetoric, and growing concerns over the safety of the food supply, have spurred more states to begin assessing ways they can limit UPFs.

But much of that work began in California. In 2023, the legislature passed a first-in-the-nation law, also sponsored by Gabriel, to ban four chemicals already prohibited in the European Union and other nations.

“It really blew my mind how out of step the United States is with the rest of the world when it comes to food safety,” said Gabriel. “We don’t love our kids here in the United States any less than they love their kids in Sweden or Saudi Arabia or South Korea. So why is it that they are taking stronger measures to protect their kids than we are?”

More than 20 other states have copied California’s ban on those four chemicals, or its similar ban on six synthetic food dyes in school meals.

Although it’s the first state to define UPFs, California is far from the only one to consider ways to remove them from school meals and the broader food supply. According to researchers at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill’s Gillings School of Global Public Health, lawmakers in at least 18 states have introduced more than 40 pieces of legislation that would restrict the sale of foods with certain additives. This year, Arizona, Arkansas, Louisiana, Utah and West Virginia have all passed laws that will ban foods containing certain dyes and additives from school meals.

“There’s something so interesting about California and West Virginia bookending the country both physically, but also with this issue around food safety,” said Bernadette del Chiaro, senior vice-president for California at the Environmental Working Group, a research and advocacy group focused on environmental and agricultural policy, which has backed the California law.

Although Kennedy has spoken out against UPFs from his post in Donald Trump’s Republican administration, Democratic states and lawmakers have raised concerns about food safety as well. But red and blue states have taken different approaches to defining the UPFs they seek to ban.

“It is really hard to define an ultra processed food,” said del Chiaro. “We all kind of know what junk food is when we see it, but putting that definition in writing that has the force of law behind it is” more difficult.

Food policy experts have generally followed a system called the Nova classification to define UPFs, but even nutritionists sometimes disagree over what counts as a UPF. The Nova classification categorizes a product as “ultra-processed” if it’s industrially formulated to be “edible, palatable and habit-forming”. But because that definition is based on processing, not specific ingredients, it can be difficult to agree on exactly which foods fall into the category.

Lindsey Smith Taillie, a professor of nutrition and co-director of the Global Food Research Program at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, said she and her colleagues have noted three different approaches states are taking to define the UPFs they seek to ban.

The most common definition of UPFs is foods that include any of about a dozen additives, “primarily artificial food dyes and then a couple emulsifiers or dough conditioners”, said Smith Taillie. A handful of other states, such as Texas and Louisiana, have used a definition that includes about 40 additives, she said, though there’s no clear through-line for why those additives were chosen, as they include some that have already been banned in the United States by the Food and Drug Administration. California, she said, stands out for taking “the most rigorous approach to evaluating the science”.

“California is the state that is coming the closest so far to trying to actually take action on this concept of UPFs as it has been defined in the literature, which I think is important because that’s where the evidence of health harm is,” Smith Taillie said. “When we look at what a lot of these states are doing with a super-narrow definition of additive, there’s really no body of evidence that suggests that that’s going to make an impact on health.”

The text of California’s new law defines a UPF as any food or beverage that contains stabilizers, thickeners, propellants, colors, emulsifiers, flavoring agents, flavor enhancers, nonnutritive sweeteners or surface-active agents – and has high amounts of saturated fat, sodium or added sugar, or nonnutritive sweeteners.

Del Chiaro, of the Environmental Working Group, hopes California’s definition might lead the way for other states and school districts.

“Shifting the purchasing decisions of the fourth-largest economy in the world, and the most populous state in the country, I think will have an absolute, positive effect on the buying options that other school districts have,” she said. “I think there will be a snowball effect here that’ll help kids all across America.”

Dating back to the 1970s, scholars have described a “California effect” in which other jurisdictions or industries adopt the regulatory standards set by one region – often California – because it is more efficient to apply the same standards everywhere. The first of those regulations forced automakers to abide by the state’s clean air policies, and more recent ones have aimed to eliminate single-use plastics.

But implementing a ban on UPFs in California school meals will take more work than simply defining UPFs, food policy experts say.

Alternatives to UPFs “would require, by definition, more cooking”, said Smith Taillie. “The only way to really do that would be, you would have to increase labor cost.”

Marion Nestle, a professor of nutrition and food policy at New York University, agrees.

“Taking UPFs out of school meals means providing kids with whole, not UPF, foods. These either have to come pre-prepared or cooked on site,” she said in an email. “USDA reimbursements have to cover not only the food; they also have to cover staff salaries, equipment and supplies.”

“Schools turn to UPFs because they are cheaper and save staff time,” she added. “Taking UPFs out of schools has to be coupled to higher reimbursement rates or it won’t work.”

In the process of passing this bill, Gabriel said many legislators had the same concern about cost. But what they found was that it’s often cheaper to eliminate UPFs. “What was very helpful to us there is that there are a number of districts in California that have already moved in this direction. And so we actually had food service directors come in and testify,” he said. “Not only had it not cost them more, but in many districts they had actually saved money by switching to healthier alternatives.”

OPINION – Following BOEM’s announcement canceling future offshore wind leases across the U.S., it’s important to remember that California still holds existing leases, including the wind area off the Central Coast. As an IBEW electrician, it’s clear to me that offshore wind is essential for our region’s future.

Having spent my career as an IBEW electrician on the Central Coast, specifically Morro Bay and San Luis Obispo, I’ve seen firsthand how this region has powered California, from Diablo Canyon to various fossil fuel operations. We understand the energy business, and frankly, it’s time for a change. As we transition from fossil fuels to clean energy, offshore wind isn’t just a good idea; it’s the perfect solution for our community and our future.

The most immediate and tangible benefit of offshore wind is jobs. Good, union jobs. These aren’t temporary gigs; they are long-term careers that will provide stability and prosperity for families right here on the Central Coast. We’re talking about jobs in manufacturing, construction, operations, and maintenance – all roles where skilled tradespeople, like my IBEW brothers and sisters, will be in high demand. We’ve seen firsthand how a robust energy sector can support local economies, and offshore wind offers us a chance to revive that economic engine for generations to come.

Beyond job creation, offshore wind addresses a critical need for our region: energy infrastructure. The Central Coast is currently losing out on business opportunities because we simply don’t have the energy capacity to power new businesses that want to move to our area. This isn’t just an inconvenience, it’s a drag on our economic growth and a limit to our potential. Offshore wind provides a reliable, clean energy source that can directly power our local economy, ensuring that the energy we produce off our coast is used right here, creating a self-sufficient and resilient energy grid.

Furthermore, this is about building a secure and affordable energy future. Union members are committed to keeping California affordable, and that extends to the energy we produce. By investing in offshore wind, we are investing in a stable energy supply that will help regulate energy costs and provide a consistent source of power for our homes, businesses, and industries. This isn’t just about environmental stewardship, it’s about practical economics and ensuring a strong future for the Central Coast.

Now, let me be clear: supporting offshore wind doesn’t make me an environmentalist. I’m an electrician. My primary concern is providing reliable power and good jobs. My priority is ensuring that our nation remains strong, economically stable, and self-sufficient. For me, offshore wind is a common-sense solution to real-world problems.

Keeping America resilient means having a robust energy supply. It means creating and sustaining well-paying jobs for American workers. It means investing in infrastructure that supports our economy and allows businesses to thrive. It means adapting to new technologies and embracing innovation. Offshore wind does all of these things. It’s an opportunity to revitalize our manufacturing sector, train a new generation of skilled workers, and secure our energy independence. This isn’t about political ideology — it’s about pragmatism, progress, and powering our future.

The Central Coast has always been a place of innovation and hard work. Let’s continue that legacy by embracing offshore wind. It’s a win-win for our community, our economy, and our future.

Indeed, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced a month later that the program was being frozen.

However, the program has been revised and stations are still being built under its purview.

It seems reasonable to assume that sometime between his January 20 executive order “Unleashing American Energy”—with its Section 1, “to eliminate the ‘electric vehicle mandate’ and promote true consumer choice”—and the end of EV tax credits after September 30, President Trump would have found a way to kill the $5 billion National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Formula Program (NEVI) Congress adopted as part of President Biden’s bipartisan infrastructure program in 2022.

Trump’s first-day EO prompted us to ask the Federal Highway Administration via email how many EV charging stations the NEVI program had built up to the point of that ominous executive order.

In May of the previous year, we reported that the program, then two years old, had yielded just eight chargers across the US.

As of August 27, there are 110 stations (about 500 charging ports) built by NEVI funding, as tracked in the station locater database according to the Federal Highway Administration.

That response came seven months after we asked the question.

“We’re going to see quite a flood of construction,” a person familiar with the program told Autoweek in September. This source believes the program will build a total of 200 stations by the end of the year, for about 1000 individual chargers.

After Trump’s January 20 EO, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy in February announced the program was being frozen. In June, a federal judge ruled the Transportation Department had exceeded its authority in putting an end to the congressionally funded program.

That sort of judicial ruling hasn’t meant much elsewhere for the Trump White House. June also was the month when the House approved a $9 billion rescission package demanded by the president that included the high-profile cut of $1.1 billion to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting for the current fiscal year and for 2026.

Instead of calling on Congress to do the same for NEVI, Trump jump-started NEVI last August 11, with Duffy saying, “if Congress is requiring the federal government to support charging stations, let’s cut the waste and do it right.”

“We’re going to see quite a flood of construction.”

“Support from states that challenged the freeze also played a role in its prompting the restart and updated guidance,” Stephanie Valdez Streaty, industry insights director and a specialist in the EV and electrified vehicle segments for Cox Automotive, told Autoweek.

The NEVI program requires states to supplement the federal funds allocated for EV charging station construction.

Duffy and the FHWA launched a review of the program’s guidance earlier this year to make NEVI more efficient. At the time, according to the FHWA, 84% of the NEVI Formula program funds remained unobligated, which the administration took as a “clear signal” of the program’s failure.

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy.

“NEVI was established to fund states’ deployment of EV charging infrastructure,” Duffy said, “but Biden and (former Transportation Secretary Pete) Buttigieg added requirements that were difficult to understand and implement.”

The FHWA directs all states to submit updated plans, which once approved, can resume NEVI funding, the agency says.

This new guidance retains the $1 billion-per-year funding of the program through the current year and through 2026.

Six states already have federal approval for their plans to build more EV charging stations in 2026, according to the National Association of State Energy Officials’ (NASEO) EV States Clearinghouse.

According to NASEO’s EV clearinghouse, 44 states have issued at least one solicitation for federal funds, 38 states have issued awards to build stations, and 16 states have at least one operational station. States have awarded $544 million in funding to complement the $3.3 billion in federal funding allocated from 2022 to 2025.

While EV federal tax credits end September 30 (though the “leasing loophole” allows consumers to take delivery of an EV after that date and still get the tax credit if they make at least their first payment by then) the auto industry is not backing off a fossil fuel-free future.

Urgency over the end of the tax credit from the One Big Beautiful tax and spending bill passed early this summer has given a big boost to the EV segment. General Motors, the number-two EV purveyor in the US, said it sold a record 21,000 Chevrolet, GMC and Cadillac EVs in August, while Cox Automotive says strong EV sales from all brands in the US market in July and August will result in full third-quarter sales when September is counted that will easily break the current record of 356,000 sold in the fourth quarter of 2024.

The other significant rule of the “EV mandate” that Trump cut with his January 20 executive order is the Biden administration Environmental Protection Agency standard meant to boost electric vehicle sales to 30%-56% by 2030-32. While EV market share is very likely to be significantly lower than 30% in five years, the extension of the federal charging station program, which addresses a top concern of EV ownership by American consumers, should guarantee continued electric vehicle growth.","https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/in-an-aerial-view-tesla-cars-recharge-at-a-tesla-charger-news-photo-1757948513.pjpeg?crop=0.984xw:0.719xh;0,0.176xh&resize=1200:*",N,,2025-09-15 12:05:32.646576

But the automotive gods have finally smiled on budget-conscious buyers: used EVs now cost less than comparable gas cars, flipping decades of conventional wisdom on its head.

The Great Price Reversal

Used EV values dropped 30-39% year-over-year while gas cars declined just 3-7%.

The numbers tell a story that would make any spreadsheet enthusiast weep with joy. Average used EVs hit $28,767 in May 2024, compared to $31,424 for used gas vehicles—a gap that widens monthly as inventory floods the market. This isn’t some statistical anomaly; it’s rapid battery innovation making three-year-old EVs feel ancient compared to today’s 300+ mile range models.

Federal Money on the Table

Up to $4,000 in tax credits sweetens deals on qualifying used EVs.

Uncle Sam wants you driving electric badly enough to subsidize your car payments. Qualifying used EVs under $25,000 earn buyers up to $4,000 in federal tax credits—essentially a government-sponsored discount that makes already cheaper EVs even more attractive. With 34% of used EV inventory now priced under $25,000, you’re looking at real money back at tax time.

Warranty Safety Net

Most used EVs remain under manufacturer coverage, eliminating battery replacement anxiety.

Here’s where the market gets interesting: 72% of used EVs are less than five years old, with 45% from 2023 or later. Translation? Your biggest fear about expensive battery replacement is largely unfounded. Most available models remain under partial warranty coverage, turning what was once a financial gamble into a calculated risk.

“The No. 1 thing we see time and time again is that the biggest factor is price. It’s not range anxiety or culture wars, it’s price,” according to Tom Narayan, auto industry analyst with RBC Capital Markets.

“Small businesses are the lifeblood of our economy,” he said, adding, “Whatever we need to do is just get regulations out of businesses’ way.” He also shared how small business regulation hinders other areas of Michigan’s economic development, including housing, and how small businesses face different requirements across municipalities, complicating the process.
Continued dialogue between small business owners, business advocates, and policymakers is essential in fostering a business-friendly climate in the Detroit Region.","During the September 2025 Small Business and Policy event, business advocates and a local legislator spoke to small business owners at the Detroit Regional Chamber to engage with local businesses, hear about their challenges, and share opportunities for them to utilize, including the cross-functional partnerships fostered by the Michigan Economic Development Corporation (MEDC) and those within the city of Detroit, including the Buildings, Safety Engineering, and Environmental Department (BSEED).

The Value of Partnerships and Streamlining Assistance

Opening the conversation, MEDC’s Senior Vice President for Small Business and Talent, Amy Rencher, discussed the top three concerns of business owners she hears, with access to capital being a primary issue.

She explained the various programs available to support small businesses in their search for capital, including the State’s Small Business Credit Initiative and the Michigan Innovation Fund. Rencher noted that a strong entrepreneurial ecosystem and close collaboration among partners are key to driving the state’s economic growth.

“We have a standing network of hundreds of partners, and we really added on to that in the past couple of years through the [small business] support hubs work,” she said, noting that there are 27 across the state. Through what is dubbed the “hub and spoke” model, their network of partners ensures that both rural and urban communities are not left excluded.

“We have a very strong network of partners for entrepreneurs and innovation in the state,” Rencher said, emphasizing the importance of collaboration to achieve greater impact.

Rencher also spoke about PitchMI, a series of regional pitch competitions designed to support early-stage tech and high-growth companies across the state as part of a broader effort to foster innovation and entrepreneurship in Michigan. The regional competitions offer a total of $250,000 in prizes, with a grand prize of $1 million to be awarded in April 2026.

Removing Burdensome Regulation

State Rep. Joe Aragona (R-Clinton Twp.) spoke primarily on his dedication to reducing regulatory burdens for small businesses. With a background in small business himself, the Chairman of the Regulatory Reform Committee shared that he understands the challenges of owning and operating a small business firsthand.

“Small businesses are the lifeblood of our economy,” he said, adding, “Whatever we need to do is just get regulations out of businesses’ way.”

He also shared how small business regulation hinders other areas of Michigan’s economic development, including housing, and how small businesses face different requirements across municipalities, complicating the process.

“It’s amazing the different hoops you have to jump through. There’s one set of hoops through this municipality, one set of hoops through another, and they’re all completely different. And you’re building the exact same house,” he said, emphasizing how housing developers struggle to operate across communities in the same county. These regulatory challenges on a hyperlocal level can have a larger-scale effect on Michigan’s economy as new businesses look to move to Michigan.

Regulation and Compliance in Detroit

Arthur Rushin, the City of Detroit’s Chief Enforcement Officer of BSEED, shared how his program’s efforts to improve the licensing and compliance process for small businesses within Detroit have been successful.

He explained that one of the department’s most powerful tools is the Development Resource Center and its online zoning portal. By simply entering an address, business owners can instantly see whether their intended use for a location is permitted, restricted, or requires special approval from the Board of Zoning Appeals. The portal doesn’t just give a yes-or-no answer; it outlines the exact steps needed to move forward so owners can plan whether or not to move forward with their business there and the steps needed to do so.

“We are a resource,” Rushin said. “No project is too small. That’s one of the things we want to make sure we stress to the public… reach out to us first, and we are literally going to walk you through the process of how to get your business started, so that way you can avoid some of the pitfalls.”

Rushin’s advice to Detroit small business owners is clear: start with BSEED before you start your business, because you can get additional resources like a free preliminary plan review.

“You come to us and say, ‘This is what I want to do, I have part of the plan,’ and we will work with you,” he said. “The department partners with agencies like the Detroit Economic Growth Corporation and participates in compliance clinics across the city to help owners get into compliance [and] stay in compliance.”

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on Friday proposed ending its Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program for power plant owners and other sources of carbon emissions — a move carbon capture advocates say would hurt efforts to develop the carbon capture and storage sector.

Parts of the EPA’s GHG reporting program are “inextricably” tied to the federal Section 45Q tax credit for carbon capture and storage, according to the Carbon Capture Coalition.

“Should this proposed rule be finalized as is, the fate of hundreds of announced carbon management projects nationwide and the billions of dollars in capital investments and corresponding jobs will be on the line,” Jessie Stolark, the coalition’s executive director, said Friday in a press release.

Treasury Department and IRS requirements for monitoring, reporting and verification programs for geologic carbon storage require taxpayers claiming the 45Q tax credit to show how much carbon they are storing by using the EPA’s GHG reporting program, according to the coalition.

Carbon management project developers have invested about $77.5 billion on existing and near-term projects, according to the coalition. “It is not an understatement that the long-term success of the carbon management industry — and the significant economic and environmental benefits it fosters across the country — rests on the robust reporting mechanisms in place through the U.S. EPA,” Stolark said.

The Carbon Capture Coalition supports policies that enable the commercial deployment of carbon management technology. Its members include unions, environmental groups and companies such as Calpine, DTE Energy, GE Vernova and NRG Energy.

Under the EPA’s GHG reporting program, initially mandated by Congress in 2008, organizations in 46 source categories are required to report their carbon emissions every year.

However, the EPA contends that the Clean Air Act doesn’t require GHG reporting for sectors outside the petroleum and natural gas source category, according to the proposal. For that category, the EPA proposed ending reporting requirements for natural gas distribution utilities and suspending them for the rest of the category until 2034, in line with the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

The EPA expects the proposal will save affected companies about $303 million a year, with the petroleum and natural gas industry saving $256 million annually, according to an agency fact sheet.

EPA will accept comments on the proposal for 47 days after it is published in the Federal Register.

The report details the economic harm caused by unnecessary permitting delays, highlights recent progress through legislation and executive action, and offers a comprehensive set of reforms to accelerate project approvals across energy, transportation, technology and other critical sectors.

“The biggest lever to unlock America’s economic potential is modernizing our permitting process,” said Brendan Bechtel, Chairman and CEO of Bechtel and Chair of the Business Roundtable Smart Regulation Committee. “From delivering clean energy and AI data centers to meeting the President’s goal of ten new nuclear reactors by 2030, the United States cannot afford to let projects sit idle for years. The policies in this report would help break the logjam and unleash investment, innovation and job creation across every sector.”

“If we want to compete and win in the coming decades, America needs a permitting process that moves at the pace of our ambitions,” said Joshua Bolten, CEO of Business Roundtable. “Congress and the Administration have made meaningful progress on this vital issue, and now is the time to finish the job by enacting bipartisan permitting reform legislation. Without the comprehensive, durable improvements outlined in this report, the United States will continue to leave trillions in investment on the sidelines.”

Problems with America’s current permitting system:

Cumbersome and time-consuming – The federal permitting process takes four to five years on average, with some projects delayed further by litigation long after agency approval.

Costly to communities and the economy – An estimated $1.5 trillion in investment is currently awaiting federal permits, while the unrealized induced GDP impact of infrastructure projects now in federal review totals approximately $1.7 trillion to $2.4 trillion.

Fragmented and redundant – Multiple overlapping reviews across agencies and jurisdictions create unnecessary duplication and delay.

Vulnerable to legal gridlock – Lengthy litigation timelines leave projects in limbo, undermining environmental review certainty and economic planning.

Policy recommendations to build on recent meaningful permitting reforms:

Improve and focus environmental reviews – Limit National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) reviews to impacts not already under another agency’s jurisdiction, require agencies to make permitting decisions within 90 days of issuing a final Environmental Impact Statement or Environmental Assessments and expand categorical exclusions.

Reform the NEPA litigation process – Specify a statute of limitations of no more than 150 days, expedite case schedules and limit injunctions that block construction after procedural compliance.

Increase domestic energy production and export – Accelerate permitting for all energy resources, liquefied natural gas (LNG) export facilities, pipelines and carbon capture infrastructure.

Expand and improve transmission capabilities and capacity – Improve the speed of the interconnection queue process and support regional and interregional transmission planning.

Ensure secure supply chains – Facilitate responsible domestic mining, processing and recycling of critical minerals essential to semiconductors, defense and advanced manufacturing.

Modernize digital and AI infrastructure approvals – Codify NEPA categorical exclusions for new and existing facilities, allow a mutual recognition permitting approval process for federal, state and local applications, and require permitting authorities to establish a single point of contact.",https://cdn.builder.io/api/v1/image/assets%2F679146658e6d45af922aa9d9409fb683%2Ffd27341a6ba7451dbe31fc8465d7c67b?quality=60&width=200&height=200,N,,2025-09-15 13:05:29.112903

The European Union’s trade surplus with the U.S. fell to 13 billion euros ($14.3 billion) in July from 18 billion euros ($19.8 billion) a year earlier, according to official EU data. The shift represents the largest monthly deterioration in the trade relationship since U.S. President Donald Trump took office.

The eurozone — the 20 EU countries that use the euro currency — showed similar patterns, with its global trade surplus falling to 12.4 billion euros from 18.5 billion euros a year earlier.

European imports of U.S. goods surged 10.7% to 31.2 billion euros, while U.S. purchases of European products dropped 4.4% to 44.2 billion euros. The diverging trends signal a fundamental shift in one of the world’s most important trade relationships.

For the first seven months of 2025, Europe’s overall trade surplus with the rest of the world plummeted to 91.8 billion euros from 108.9 billion euros in the same period last year — a decline of 17.1 billion euros, reflecting broader competitiveness challenges.

The deteriorating U.S. relationship drove much of that decline. European exports to the U.S. have fallen as the dollar strengthened and American consumers shifted purchasing patterns, while Europeans are buying more American energy, technology and agricultural products.

European chemical companies — which produce everything from plastics to pharmaceuticals — saw their global trade surplus collapse from 22.2 billion euros to 16.6 billion euros compared to July 2024, a 5.6-billion-euro drop that largely reflects reduced U.S. demand.

Other European-manufactured goods also struggled, with the trade deficit in that sector widening from 1.9 billion euros to 3.1 billion euros.

Only machinery and vehicles — including German cars and industrial equipment — showed strength, with Europe’s surplus in that sector rising to 21.4 billion euros in July from 16.5 billion euros in June.

The trade deterioration reflects broader economic weakness across Europe, where second-quarter growth of just 0.1% lagged far behind the U.S. robust 0.8% expansion. European business investment plunged 1.8% in the second quarter while retail spending declined, reducing demand for U.S. products even as Europeans continued buying essential energy and technology.

Germany, Europe’s economic powerhouse, contracted 0.3% in the second quarter despite modest annual growth, directly impacting the chemicals and manufacturing sectors that traditionally drive European exports across the Atlantic.

The July figures represent a continuation of trade pressures that began when Trump imposed 10% tariffs on most EU goods in April, with automotive duties hitting 25%. As tensions escalated through the spring, Trump threatened to raise tariff rates to 30%, creating uncertainty that deepened the trade damage.

In June, the EU’s trade surplus had already plummeted 61% year-over-year to just 8 billion euros as businesses braced for potentially devastating tariff increases, with European exports to America falling 10.3% while imports surged 16.4%.

The July data suggest the bleeding continued even as Trump and EU leaders worked toward the trade agreement they would eventually reach on July 27, capping most tariffs at 15%.

The trade shift comes as Trump has intensified pressure on European allies to stop buying Russian oil and gas as a condition for stronger U.S. sanctions against Moscow. On Saturday, Trump wrote on a Truth Social post: “I am ready to do major Sanctions on Russia when all NATO Nations have agreed, and started, to do the same thing, and when all NATO Nations STOP BUYING OIL FROM RUSSIA.”

European officials bristled at Trump’s latest public ultimatum.

“We’re not going to comment on social media posts by the U.S. president,” a European Commission spokesman said curtly Monday when pressed about Trump’s demands during a Brussels briefing. “The successive sanctions packages we have brought forward are working. The economic evidence shows that they are having an impact on the Russian economy.”

The tensions reflect broader disagreements over sanctions coordination, with Trump’s assessment that European sanctions against Russia aren’t “tough enough.”

Energy has become a major factor in the changing trade relationship, with the United States now supplying 50.7% of Europe’s liquefied natural gas needs and serving as the bloc’s largest oil supplier at 15% of petroleum imports. European purchases of American liquefied natural gas have surged 113.5% in volume since 2021, a dramatic shift from when Russia provided 48% of EU natural gas and 29% of petroleum oil imports, compared to just 12% and 2% respectively by mid-2025.

European energy purchases from the U.S. totaled $76 billion in 2024, and the July 27 trade agreement commits the EU to buying $250 billion annually in U.S. energy over the next three years — more than tripling current import levels.

However, Trump has warned that tariffs could rise to 35% if the EU fails to meet its commitments, including an additional $600 billion in U.S. manufacturing investments.

The economic slowdown is beginning to affect European job markets, with employment growth slowing to 0.1% in both the eurozone and EU, down from 0.2% growth in the first quarter. Annual employment growth also slowed to 0.6% in the eurozone and 0.4% in the EU compared to the same period last year, according to separate EU data released Monday. About 219.9 million people were employed across the EU in the second quarter, with 171.6 million in the eurozone.

The labor market weakness extended to job openings, with European companies posting fewer available positions. The job vacancy rate fell to 2.1% across the EU in the second quarter, down from 2.4% a year earlier. Germany, Europe’s largest economy, saw its vacancy rate drop from 3.1% to 2.5%, while manufacturing job openings fell to just 1.6% across the EU, suggesting businesses are becoming more cautious about expansion plans amid trade uncertainties.

Trade between EU member states remained strong, rising 2.9% to 349.2 billion euros in July, suggesting Europe’s internal market continues functioning smoothly even as external trade weakens.

The U.S. represents Europe’s largest trading partner outside the European continent, making the relationship crucial for both economies. The European Union — a 27-country economic bloc that includes Germany, France, Italy and other major economies — operates as a single market larger than the United States. Unlike individual U.S. states, EU countries surrender their trade policy to Brussels, which negotiates on behalf of all members.

Unlike other states, which have set targets to reduce traffic and expand public transit, Massachusetts has pinned its climate strategy on hopes that consumers will start buying more electric vehicles (EVs).

In July, the Republican Party's ""Big Beautiful Bill"" eliminated a $7,500 federal rebate for new electric car purchases.
Researchers from Princeton University predict that the repeal of those benefits will considerably depress the market share for new electric vehicles in the next few years.","Recent actions from the Trump administration and other Republicans in Washington have considerably slowed the rate at which car buyers are choosing electric vehicles – a trend that puts the Commonwealth's legally-mandated pollution reduction targets even further out of reach.

Roads and highways are the biggest remaining source of greenhouse gas pollution (and air pollution in general) in New England. Unlike other states, which have set targets to reduce traffic and expand public transit, Massachusetts has pinned its climate strategy on hopes that consumers will start buying more electric vehicles (EVs).

The state's official Clean Energy and Climate Plan, published in 2020, says that ""Massachusetts will need to deploy 750,000 to one million ZEVs (zero emission vehicles) by 2030.""

That plan isn't working. As of July, there were only 152,000 fully electric or plug-in hybrid cars registered in the Commonwealth.

Meeting the low end of the state's 2030 target for EV deployment would require roughly one in three new car sales to be EVs each year over the next 5 years.

But EVs currently make up around 11 percent of new car sales, and those sales have slowed considerably this year, driven by plummeting demand for Teslas over the winter and spring.

Meanwhile, gasoline consumption – and all the air pollution that comes with it – is continuing to increase.

And then came Trump

If the outlook for the state's EV market was discouraging before, it's deteriorated even further in the last few months.

In July, the Republican Party's ""Big Beautiful Bill"" eliminated a $7,500 federal rebate for new electric car purchases. That rebate will no longer be available after September 30th.

Researchers from Princeton University predict that the repeal of those benefits will considerably depress the market share for new electric vehicles in the next few years. With the tax credits, EVs were expected to make up 40 percent of new car sales by 2030; without them, they're expected to represent just 24 percent of new cars by the end of the decade.

Congress has also voted to eliminate the ""Advanced Clean Cars"" rule, a California clean-air regulation that Massachusetts and several other states have adopted to gradually phase out the sale of gasoline-powered vehicles.

California regulators are fighting that legislation in court, and Attorney General Andrea Campbell joined the lawsuit in June.

But in Massachusetts, it's a bit of a moot point. In deference to lobbying from car dealers and manufacturers, Governor Healey had already announced (in May) that her administration won't enforce the Advanced Clean Car rule for the next two years anyhow.

Massachusetts Democrats sit idly by

This spring, the Massachusetts legislature announced that it was launching ""Response 2025,"" which lawmakers described as ""a coordinated effort"" to counteract new policies from Washington with legislation at the state level.

""We are committed to protecting our residents, defending our values, and leading Massachusetts through the uncertainty of federal action,"" Senate President Karen E. Spilka said in an April 1 press release. ""The Senate will not sit idly by—we have heard the concerns of our residents, and we are prepared to act.""

StreetsblogMASS reached out to Sen. Cindy Friedman of Arlington, who's leading the ""Response 2025"" initiative, to ask whether she and her colleagues were discussing any ideas for putting the transportation sector back on track to meet the state's climate goals.

Stephen Acosta, a spokesperson for the Senator, wrote back to tell StreetsblogMASS that ""unfortunately, she's not available to speak on this.""

At a ribbon-cutting for a new e-bike charging station in Somerville last month, StreetsblogMASS put a similar question to the Commonwealth's Transportation Secretary Monica Tibbits-Nutt.

""We're keeping with pushing ahead,"" said Tibbits-Nutt. ""We have the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Program (NEVI), which is $65 million from the federal government which we have obligated.""

That federal program is also under fire from Washington's Republicans, but the funding will install new charging stations every 50 miles along the Commonwealth's major highways.

Still, without a major change in course in the Commonwealth's current laws and regulations, there won't be nearly enough electric vehicles using those stations to make a meaningful impact on air pollution.

Course correction

When we pressed Tibbits-Nutt to tell us what her agency would do to reduce the root cause of highway pollution – the excessive number of vehicles clogging the state's roadways – the Secretary cited the administration's efforts to fund the MBTA and increase funding for the state's Regional Transit Authorities (RTAs).

""For us it's always been the focus, on reducing VMT (vehicle miles travelled). One of the reasons I think the Legislature is with the record amount of transportation funding, especially to the MBTA, we're able to put more buses on the road and expand transit, so we can encourage people to that mode shift,"" said Tibbits-Nutt.

But the vast majority of the Legislature's budget increases for transit agencies this year is merely backfilling a decade's worth of cuts and deferred maintenance left over from Gov. Baker's administration. The T still has a multi-billion dollar shortfall for repair projects, and its most transformative plans to expand transit service remain unfunded.

Seth Gadbois, an attorney for the Conservation Law Foundation, says there's a fundamental gap in accountability between what lawmakers have promised in the Global Warming Solutions Act and what they fund in their budgets.

""States like Massachusetts not only have the space to act, they have a legal and moral responsibility to do so,"" Gadbois told StreetsblogMASS (editor's note: the Conservation Law Foundation is the fiscal sponsor of StreetsblogMASS, which means it administers our payroll and finances; it does not have any role in governance or editorial decisions).

Gadbois has been working with a handful of lawmakers, led by Sen. Cynthia Creem of Newton and Rep. Jack Patrick Lewis of Framingham, to pass what they're calling the ""Freedom to Move Act,"" which would require MassDOT to align its spending priorities with the pollution reduction mandates in the state's Global Warming Solutions Act.

Lawmakers in Colorado, Washington, and Minnesota have already passed similar laws.

""Right now we don’t have a check against whether our transportation dollars are helping or hurting our climate targets,"" said Gadbois. ""Freedom to Move aligns state level transport policy and spending with our climate obligations... It’s a big policy alignment shift that will ultimately expand the menu of options for how people get around.""

At the ribbon-cutting in Somerville last month, we asked Tibbit-Nutt whether she supported the Freedom to Move Act, or whether MassDOT had taken a position. She declined to answer the question.",https://lede-admin.mass.streetsblog.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/49/2024/05/EmptyTeslaChargingParking-e1757618338900.jpg,N,,2025-09-15 12:05:41.030475

As economies and political arenas may vary, there are some common themes worth exploring:

Workforce: Policies outlining apprenticeships, careers in technical education (CTE), and grants driven by the Workforce Innovation Opportunity Act (WIOA);

Capital-Investment: Incentives including equipment grants, refundable wage credits, and tax credits for clean-energy manufacturers; and

Regulation and Permitting: Deliberations on environmental and infrastructure priorities.

Below is a brief overview of each state’s relevant activities:

Operating on a biennial budget, Maine is focused on financing programs for farm equipment and state-administered incentives through entities like the Maine Technology Institute (MTI) among others. AEM’s Advocacy Team is following discussions on proposed fees and product-specific regulatory changes like Polyfluoroalkyl Substance (PFAS) policies post-ban. Forthcoming legislation will be monitored for anticipated equipment-related appropriations and repair measures that could affect local suppliers and dealers.

The recent 2024–28 workforce plan (mandated by Blanketed environmental rulemaking is affecting permitting timelines for heavy-equipment installers and outdoor operations. Monitoring workforce grants and EDIP eligibility as changes are discussed will be of central importance.

Recently enacted policies prioritized economic and workforce development (S.122/Act 65purchase funding, and grants for farm modernization and water infrastructure. While balancing new business resources with regulation and costs remain key, manufacturers that sell to farms should track VEGI eligibility and capital grants.

Local-aid and business tax credits were center stage this year. AEM’s Advocacy Team is focused on expanded workforce funding, targeted tax-credit programs, and ongoing incentive language that can influence site-selection and workforce pipeline development. Municipal procurement and local permitting reforms being discussed by the municipal associations are impacting installers and on-site equipment businesses and should continue to provide insight on opportunities.

Boosting direct manufacturing supports like the Manufacturing Equipment Grant Program reimbursing up to 50% of equipment purchase or down payment was the focus. There were also some adjustments to taxes and fuel fees aimed at lowering the near-term capital cost of buying machinery and encouraging tech upgrades in small- and mid-sized shops. AEM’s Advocacy Team will continue engaging on program details and scoring criteria for equipment grants.

Site readiness, broadband, and targeted capital financing being provided by the Council on Development Finance is through loans and grants. These loans and grants can also be leveraged for factory modernization. The new administration has touted less reliance on traditional grants and revamping existing policies. AEM’s Advocacy Team will be monitoring any changes to incentive structures and forthcoming bond/capital projects legislation.

Recent policies expanded business incentives, jobs retention and training credits, resiliency programming, and clean-energy procurement preferences, while modernizing manufacturing support for sectors like semiconductor and advanced-manufacturing. State-level clean energy and solar program funding changes are affecting supply chains for equipment makers in the state by redistributing incentives. This creates the need to review tax-credit policy as it is implemented with a focus on manufacturing wage/training credits.

Benefitting from a proposed increase in funding for vocational education, apprenticeships, and advanced-manufacturing workforce grants; equipment manufacturers could also see scaled tech training. Workforce pipeline investments that improve access to skilled operators/technicians and job retention credits for site expansions are being prioritized in the budget proposal also. The budget process currently lies with the General Assembly awaiting votes for final passage.

New Jersey

Last month the Governor signed a significant manufacturing tax-credit package: $500 million to expand tax credits for manufacturers who locate or grow their business in the state. From that, $200 million is being dedicated over the next two years for clean-energy product manufacturers (solar, geothermal, green hydrogen).

Analysis by financial advisory Lazard found that solar levelized cost of electricity beats the lowest-cost fossil fuel for new-build projects, even without tax credits.","The U.S. solar industry is grappling with heavy changes to energy industrial policy, as federal legislation removes incentives that were designed to accelerate the transition to renewables.

On the campaign trail, President Donald Trump voiced support for an “all the above” approach to energy policy. However, the second Trump administration and the Republican-led Congress have come down hard on solar, wind, and electric vehicles via Congressional budget changes and executive actions.

Chief among the changes within the OBBBA are the early phase-outs of the 48E Investment Tax Credit (ITC) and 45Y Production Tax Credit (PTC). Both credits are demand-side incentives that have been instrumental in speeding up the energy transition.

The early loss of tax credits is expected to deal long-term damage to the industry. Wood Mackenzie forecasts that 10-year installations could decrease 17%, reaching volumes as low as 375 GW.

Crunch time

Following a predicted boom to meet deadlines for accessing the PTC and ITC, U.S. clean-energy installations could plunge 41% after 2027, according to a forecast from BloombergNEF (BNEF).

Previously, the 48E and 45Y tax credits were to be available to projects until the United States achieved a 75% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from 2022 levels. These credits were made available via the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022.

Now, under the OBBBA, solar and wind projects that begin construction more than 12 months after the July 4 enactment must be “placed in service,” meaning reaching commercial operations, by Dec. 31, 2027, to qualify for credits.

Projects that begin construction within 12 months of enactment can be eligible for tax credits if a “substantial portion” is built. These projects are “safe harbored” and can gain the tax credit if they are placed in service by mid-2030.

“Solar installations are expected to increase in 2025-26 as developers rush to meet deadlines,” said Wood Mackenzie. “Permitted projects are well-positioned, but unpermitted developments face growing uncertainty as permitting bottlenecks threaten to push completion dates outside eligibility windows.”

Keith Martin, partner at Norton Rose Fulbright, said projects will likely need to “incur” at least 5% of their cost to qualify for safe harbor designation. “Costs are usually incurred only as the developer takes delivery of equipment or services, with one exception. A payment for specific equipment or services by the deadline counts if delivery is reasonably expected within 3.5 months. There are nuances about counting payments for services,” said Martin.

The other path to qualification, he said, is to start “physical work of a significant nature” at a project site on portions of an installation eligible for the 48E credit.

“In the short term, we’re all going to be extremely busy trying to get projects going at the outset of July 4, 2026,” said Martin, appearing on the “Currents” podcast hosted by law firm Norton Rose Fulbright. “After that, I think people will have their heads down trying to develop and build these projects, finance them. There’ll be a distant place and service date for those.”

“So I think we’ll do fine,” said Martin. “Eventually there will be a new administration. Maybe people will be more concerned about climate change. We’ve seen this play before. These tax credits started in 1992 and they have expired, been restored, expired, been restored. So it’s perfectly possible we’ll see that again.”

The storm is surely in sight. In July, shortly following passage of OBBBA, New Leaf Energy, a community and utility-scale project developer, laid off about one-fifth of its workforce – 41 out of 217 employees. “The pathway to developing clean energy projects has narrowed, but it has not vanished; reducing the size of the company is intended to provide stability and free cash while the company adapts to a changed market for the long term,” said New Leaf Energy in a statement.

Unlike solar and wind, grid-scale energy storage will remain eligible for the ITC and PTC under its original schedule. The 48E and 45Y credits for storage projects will phase out by 25% each year starting in 2032 until Dec. 31, 2035, when the credits will expire entirely.

What’s more, projects are facing tightened restrictions on components and materials sourced from “Foreign Entities of Concern” (see pp. 10-12).

Residential pressure

The window is even tighter for residential solar. While lobbying was successful in preventing a near-instant phase-out of the 48E ITC, the 25D tax credit for residential solar projects, paid directly to individuals who purchase home solar with a loan or cash, is phased out for projects not installed by the end of 2025.

The cuts to credits come at a particularly hard time for U.S. residential solar. Installations declined 31% in 2024, according to Wood Mackenzie. Over the last year, industry titans like SunPower, Sunnova, and Mosaic Solar have filed for bankruptcy. The industry historically has leaned on the value proposition of lowering customer electricity bills and providing predictable costs for the long term. However, that value has been increasingly difficult to provide.

Gone are the days of low interest rates enabling attractive finance terms for loans or leased systems. In many major markets, such as California, net metering rates for sending excess electricity to the grid have been slashed by 75% or more. One pathway to continuing to drive customer value is pursuing lower soft costs – expenses not tied to hardware.

The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) said more than 65% of the cost to install residential solar is related to soft costs like paying sales teams, securing permits, and grid connection costs. The United States may find a path forward by pursuing market conditions like Australia, where over 40% of homes in some regions have rooftop solar. Soft costs are far lower in the nation, with an average residential solar installation cost of AUD 0.89/W ($0.58), according to a January 2025 report from price comparison website Compare the Market – more than AUD 2.00/W cheaper than in both Canada and the United States.

Underlying strength

Since long-term federal tax credits were enacted by the IRA, about 80% of investment announcements were in Republican-led districts. More than 224 projects totaling nearly $110 billion in investment and leading to more than 83,000 jobs were announced in Republican voting districts, according to E2. Even before the OBBBA was passed, the looming threat of cuts led to billions of dollars in project and factory cancellations and the loss of tens of thousands of expected or existing jobs in these districts.

However, the fundamentals for solar remain strong. Analysis by financial advisory Lazard found that solar levelized cost of electricity beats the lowest-cost fossil fuel for new-build projects, even without tax credits. Solar represented 78% of new capacity added to the grid in 2025 through April, according to Federal Energy Regulatory Commission data. With electricity demand expected to rise 2% per year and 50% cumulatively by 2050, according to the National Electrical Manufacturers Association, demand for projects that can be added to the grid quickly will remain robust.",https://pv-magazine-usa.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/Solar_installation_technician_on_rooftop_5392894792-1536x865-1-1200x676.jpg,N,,2025-09-15 12:05:46.502426

Alternative energy truck maker ZM Trucks cut the ribbon on its U.S. headquarters and assembly plant last month in Fontana, California — launching its expansion just as federal EV tax credits wind down, emissions rules shift and charging infrastructure remains uneven.

Even so, the company says policy headwinds won’t deter it from competing in the North American market.

“ZM Trucks has never relied on federal incentives as part of our go-to-market strategy,” a spokesperson for the OEM said in an email to Trucking Dive on Sept. 9. Instead, the company focuses on state-level programs in key markets, such as New York, New Jersey, Texas and California — along with plans for Nevada and Washington.

A subsidiary of Japan-based ZO Motors, ZM Trucks has the benefit of a global perspective when it comes to its customers’ potential charging concerns. ZO Motors has plants in Japan and Cambodia, producing both electric- and hydrogen-powered commercial vehicles.

“Our experience has shown that establishing ‘behind-the-fence’ charging is critical for a successful transition to electric powertrains,” ZM Trucks said via email. “Relying on public charging as a primary solution is cost-prohibitive in the U.S. While it’s useful as a backup in emergencies, it doesn’t support a sustainable business case on its own.”

With infrastructure seen as a limiting factor, ZM Trucks is turning attention to what it can control: production.

At its 210,000-square-foot facility in Fontana, ZM Trucks currently has 39 employees on its pilot line, where it plans to build two models:

The battery-electric T75, a heavy-duty vehicle built for ports, warehouses and distribution yards with a 75-mile range

The battery-electric ZM8, a short-wheelbase model designed for urban delivery and upfit applications with an estimated 165-mile range

So far, the ZM8 has found its largest base among final-mile delivery companies and small businesses, while the T75 is currently used exclusively in port operations. The company did not disclose customer names.

Notably, the factory was designed to build ZM Trucks’ T75, ZM8 and future models all on the same line. Once the line is fully operational, it will be tooled to produce three trucks per hour, the company said.

“With our current tooling investment, we can support three jobs per hour on a single shift — giving us ample production capacity to meet future demand,” ZM Trucks said, noting production is constrained by supply chain lead times, rather than its ability to scale internally.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/dooKGyzDOaKkvv-Aqa401oke3OYPeyw2ImG0pgFXG5U/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9aTVRydWNrc0V2ZW50MjAyNTQ1LnBuZw==.webp,N,,2025-09-15 12:05:49.922524

Researchers from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) and LG Energy Solution have developed a ""cohesion-inhibiting new liquid electrolyte"" that effectively solves the dendrite problem that has long plagued lithium-metal batteries. This innovation enables remarkable performance metrics that could transform the EV landscape: 800km range on a single charge, a lifespan exceeding 300,000km, and most impressively, a super-fast charging time of just 12 minutes.

The dendrite challenge is solved

Lithium-metal batteries, which replace the graphite anode found in conventional lithium-ion batteries with pure lithium metal, offer significantly higher energy density. However, they've been hampered by the formation of dendrites—tree-like lithium crystal structures that grow on the anode surface during charging, particularly during rapid charging cycles.

The research team identified that non-uniform interfacial cohesion on the lithium metal surface is the fundamental cause of dendrite formation during rapid charging. Their solution employs an anion structure with weak binding affinity to lithium ions, which minimizes interface non-uniformity and effectively suppresses dendrite growth even under fast-charging conditions.

""This research has become a key foundation for overcoming the technical challenges of lithium-metal batteries by understanding the interfacial structure,"" stated Professor Hee Tak Kim from KAIST's Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering. ""It has overcome the biggest barrier to the introduction of lithium-metal batteries for electric vehicles.""

The study was published in Nature Energy on September 3, 2025, with Hyeokjin Kwon as the first author.

The fast-charging revolution

This breakthrough joins a wave of recent advancements in fast-charging battery technology that we have been featuring in recent months:

In May 2025, CATL unveiled its Ultra-Fast battery technology, which can provide enough charge for 75km of driving in mere seconds. CATL's second-generation Shenxing battery technology aims to deliver charging speeds comparable to refueling a gasoline vehicle, potentially accelerating mass EV adoption.

The CATL Shenxing Pro battery employs several innovative approaches to achieve its remarkable charging speeds. As we reported, the Shenxing Pro batteries feature a 758 km WLTP range and are specifically designed for Europe's growing EV market with fast-charging capabilities.

According to Inside EVs, CATL claims this is ""the world's first LFP battery featuring both an 800 km range and a 12C peak charging rate,"" making it one of the most impressive advancements in LFP battery technology to date.

Industry implications

The IEA Global EV Outlook 2025 report highlights that fast-charging infrastructure is rapidly becoming essential for EV adoption worldwide. According to our cousins at EV Infrastructure News, global fast charging capacity is projected to grow more than tenfold by 2030, keeping pace with the growing EV market that exceeded 17 million sales globally in 2024.

Leawat has also entered the ultra-fast charging space with their 46-Series cylindrical batteries featuring 20% reduced internal resistance, 5% higher energy density, and an impressive 50C discharge rate, as announced at The Battery Show Europe 2025.

The KAIST/LG Energy Solution breakthrough represents a significant leap forward, as their 12-minute charging time for an 800km range battery would effectively eliminate range anxiety and charging concerns for most consumers.

Je-Young Kim, CTO of LG Energy Solution, emphasized the importance of industry-academia collaboration: ""The four years of collaboration between LG Energy Solution and KAIST through FRL are producing meaningful results. We will continue to strengthen our industry-academia collaboration to solve technical challenges and create the best results in the field of next-generation batteries.""

What's next?

As these technologies move from laboratory to production, the EV landscape could transform dramatically. The combination of ultra-fast charging, extended range, and longer battery lifespans addresses the three primary consumer concerns about electric vehicles.

With multiple companies now demonstrating viable fast-charging solutions using different technological approaches, the race is on to bring these innovations to market.

Associated Press

The Environmental Protection Agency on Friday proposed doing away with a program that has required large, mostly industrial polluters to report their planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions to the government.

The program requires refineries, power plants, oil wells and landfills to report their emissions without risk of penalty as officials seek to identify high-polluting facilities and develop policies to lower emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. Experts say the reporting held the companies publicly accountable for their emissions.

Since the program began in 2009, U.S. industry has collectively reported a 20% drop in carbon emissions, mostly driven by the closure of coal-fired power plants.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin called the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program “burdensome” and unhelpful to improving human health and the environment.

Removing the rule would save American businesses up to $2.4 billion in regulatory costs over 10 years while maintaining the agency’s statutory obligations under the Clean Air Act, Zeldin said. If finalized, the proposal would remove reporting obligations for most large industrial facilities in the United States, as well as fuel and industrial gas suppliers and carbon dioxide injection sites.

“The Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program is nothing more than bureaucratic red tape that does nothing to improve air quality,” Zeldin said in a statement.

“It costs American businesses and manufacturing billions of dollars, driving up the cost of living, jeopardizing our nation’s prosperity and hurting American communities,” he said. “With this proposal, we show once again that fulfilling EPA’s statutory obligations and Powering the Great American Comeback is not a binary choice.”

But experts say dropping the requirement — as Zeldin promised in March when he unleashed what he called the greatest day of deregulation in U.S. history — risks a big increase in emissions, since companies would no longer be publicly accountable for what they discharge into the air. And they say losing the data — at the same time the EPA is cutting air quality monitoring elsewhere — would make it tougher to fight climate change.

Joseph Goffman, who led EPA’s Office of Air and Radiation under President Joe Biden, said eliminating the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program “blinds Americans to the facts about climate pollution. Without it, policymakers, businesses and communities cannot make sound decisions about how to cut emissions and protect public health.”

By hiding pollution information from the public, “Administrator Zeldin is denying Americans the ability to see the damaging results of his actions on climate pollution, air quality and public health,” Goffman said, calling the plan “yet another example of the Trump administration putting polluters before people’s health.”

David Doniger, a senior strategist at the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group, called the proposal “a cynical effort to keep the American public in the dark, because if they don’t know who the polluters are, they can’t do anything to hold them responsible.”

Big polluters may want to keep their climate pollution secret, he added, but the public, states and local policymakers “have depended on this data” for more than 15 years. Public accountability and pushback from investors have led many companies to reduce their climate pollution even before EPA sets stricter standards, Doniger said.

But Zeldin said reducing the overall regulatory burden on U.S. industry will allow companies to “focus compliance expenditures on actual, tangible environmental benefits.”

The Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program covers 47 source categories and requires more than 8,000 facilities and suppliers in the U.S. to calculate their greenhouse gas emissions annually, Zeldin said.

“Following a careful review, EPA proposed that there is no requirement under (the Clean Air Act) to collect GHG emission information from businesses, nor is continuing the ongoing costly data collection useful to fulfill any of the agency’s statutory obligations,” he said.

The EPA will accept public comments on the proposal for more than six weeks after the plan is published in the Federal Register, expected in coming days.",https://planetdetroit.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AP25255740590738.jpg,N,,2025-09-15 12:06:31.001258

As one of the hottest topics in boardrooms and for governments, it is the subject of a key panel at Sustainability LIVE: Climate Week NYC on 22 September at Convene, 360 Madison Avenue, NYC.

Hundreds of c-suite sustainability leaders will gather for the landmark event, hoping for new ideas on how to accelerate the energy transition.

The Future of Energy Transition, sponsored by Siemens

Automation Machinery Manufacturing giant Siemens is sponsoring the panel, which will be introduced with a keynote by Stacy Mahler, US Head of Sustainability.

Stacy has more than 15 years of experience in the industrial and energy sectors.

As Head of Sustainability for Siemens Smart Infrastructure (SI) in the US, she engages organisations on their sustainability journey.

Her work includes helping them with infrastructure enhancements that improve energy efficiency, integrate renewable energy and enable electrification of transportation and facilities.

Stacy also supports the carbon reduction roadmap for Siemens SI’s carbon footprint in the US.

She holds a degree in Electrical Engineering from the University of Florida and an MBA from Northwestern University.

Three major themes

While the panellists are likely to cover a broad range of aspects to the energy transition, three in particular are expected to feature:

Decentralisation of energy systems

The future of energy is moving from centralised, fossil-fuel power plants to decentralised networks of renewable generation.

Solar rooftops, wind farms, microgrids and virtual power plants (VPPs) are among the technologies designed to increase resilience against blackouts, reduce transmission losses and democratise access to clean energy.

Companies are pioneering distributed solutions, while governments are updating regulations to accommodate peer-to-peer energy trading.

Decentralisation also supports rural electrification, particularly in emerging economies, where microgrids can leapfrog traditional grid infrastructure.

Electrification of transport and industry

Hard-to-abate sectors transport and heavy industry are attempting to electrify to cut reliance on oil, coal and gas.

Electric vehicles (EVs) are scaling rapidly, with many global automakers committing to phase out combustion engines.

In heavy industry, processes including steelmaking and cement production are increasingly using renewable power.

The challenge lies in ensuring that grids can handle increased demand without compromising reliability – meaning energy storage, demand response and grid modernisation will be crucial.

Green hydrogen and alternative fuels

Green hydrogen, produced through renewable-powered electrolysis, is emerging as one of the keys of the energy transition.

It offers a solution for sectors where direct electrification is difficult, such as aviation, shipping and heavy industry.

Companies including Air Liquide, Siemens Energy and bp are investing heavily in hydrogen infrastructure.

Alongside biofuels and synthetic fuels, hydrogen promises to help decarbonise global trade and transport. But scaling requires massive investment, cost reductions and supportive policies.

Leaders from NVIDIA, Oracle and EEI

Stacy will be joined on the panel, moderated by BizClik Group Broadcast Director Neil Perry, by:

Josh Parker, Head of Sustainability, NVIDIA

An engineer and a lawyer, Josh believes following the data wherever it leads is critical for an effective sustainability programme.

He previously led sustainability at Western Digital, a computer storage company, and practised patent law at the law firm Baker Botts.

Jennifer Ruch, Energy & Sustainability Director, Oracle

Jennifer is an energy strategy and sustainability leader focusing on cloud and hyperscale data centre deployments globally.

She is responsible for elevating energy strategy, renewable energy procurement and sustainability globally at Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.

Jennifer also leads efforts to embed sustainability in site selection, portfolio management and data centre design.

These include a deal between X-Energy and Centrica, with plans to build up to 12 advanced modular reactors in Hartlepool.
This would cut nuclear approvals for advanced designs, such as the Rolls-Royce SMR, from three to four years to just two.
Critics of the nuclear power drive have raised objections that the nuclear fuel cycle produces significant volumes of dangerous waste, some of which remains radioactive for thousands of years.
However, proponents highlight nuclear power’s low-carbon nature and ability to reliably generate energy at any time of day, at scale.","The landmark Atlantic Partnership for Advanced Nuclear Energy sees market access expanded for both UK and US companies, with several major commercial deals announced.

These include a deal between X-Energy and Centrica, with plans to build up to 12 advanced modular reactors in Hartlepool. This would generate enough power for 1.5 million homes, and create up to 2,500 jobs. The project, the companies noted, could be worth £40bn in economic value, with £12bn of value within the North East of England alone.

The suite of deals would also include an £11bn project between Holtec, EDF and Tritax creating advanced data centres powered by small modular reactors in Nottinghamshire, and a project between Last Energy and DP World, backed by £80m in private investment, to establish one of the world’s first micro modular nuclear power plants.

It also includes a £4m deal between Urenco and Radiant to supply advanced HALEU fuel to the US market, and a plan between TerraPower and KBR to conduct studies and evaluate UK sites for the deployment of the Ntrium advanced reactor technology, with each reactor supporting around 1,600 construction jobs and 250 permanent jobs.

Under the deal, the US and UK could fast-track reactor design checks for those reactors already rigorously checked in one country to avoid duplication of work. This would cut nuclear approvals for advanced designs, such as the Rolls-Royce SMR, from three to four years to just two.

The deal has the potential to create around 2,500 jobs in Teesside, going beyond the already 11,000 jobs created in 2025 through government-led investment, according to Nuclear Industry Association statistics.

The partnership also extends to fusion energy through co-ordinated experimental programmes, in which AI technology is used to create advanced simulation tools. Following this, a global fusion energy policy summit will be co-hosted in the US in 2026, to strengthen international cooperation on fusion energy.

Prime Minister Keir Starmer said: “This landmark UK-US nuclear partnership is not just about powering our homes, it’s about powering our economy, our communities, and our ambition. These major commitments set us well on course to a golden age of nuclear that will drive down household bills in the long run, while delivering thousands of good jobs in the short term.

“Together with the US, we’re building a golden age of nuclear that puts both countries at the forefront of global innovation and investment.”

Prior projects

Expanded nuclear power is central to the UK Government’s clean energy mission, part of the UK’s drive to build more clean power for improved energy security.

This deal is part of what has been described by the UK Government as a ‘golden age’ of nuclear, and follows a £38bn investment in the Sizewell C nuclear power plant by investors including the UK Government, Canadian multinational La Caisse, British energy giant Centrica, EDF and Amber Infrastructure.

The Sizewell C plant will have an operating lifespan of at least 60 years. While project costs have grown from £20bn over the years, partly due to inflation, the UK Government maintains that it represents value for money, with £2bn of avoided annual electricity system costs predicted compared to renewables.

Critics of the nuclear power drive have raised objections that the nuclear fuel cycle produces significant volumes of dangerous waste, some of which remains radioactive for thousands of years. However, proponents highlight nuclear power’s low-carbon nature and ability to reliably generate energy at any time of day, at scale.

Energy Secretary Ed Miliband stated: “We’re kickstarting a golden age of nuclear in this country, joining forces with the US to turbocharge new nuclear developments and secure the technologies of the future.

“Nuclear will power our homes with clean, homegrown energy and the private sector is building it in Britain, delivering growth and well-paid skilled jobs for working people.”",https://edienetlive.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/full_42080.jpg,N,,2025-09-15 12:06:09.665807

""Our data shows that dealers leaned on aggressive lease strategies, particularly in EVs, to clear aging inventory ahead of expiring EV tax incentives,"" Allen says.

Deadline Essentially Extended

Some context: The earlier expectation was that EV buyers had to take actual delivery by Sept. 30, when the $7,500 EV tax break is set to expire. But on Aug. 21, the IRS published guidance that says EV buyers still qualify for the incentive as long as they get their orders in by the deadline, even if actual delivery takes place later.

The actual wording is trickier. The IRS says that to qualify for the tax incentive, the buyer has to ""acquire"" an EV by the deadline. But in a ""Frequently Asked Questions"" section of the notice, the IRS states, ""a vehicle is 'acquired' as of the date a written binding contract is entered into and a payment has been made.

The installation is one of three that supplies renewable energy to the Rhode Island electric grid, in exchange for utility bill credits for regional housing authorities, lowering their operating costs and ultimately lowering energy prices for public housing residents. Announced in 2021, the construction of the project is now complete, and all three solar installations are supplying green energy to the Rhode Island electric grid.

The collaboration between PHARI, Nautilus and Veolia is a first of its kind in the nation encompassing multiple public housing authorities under a single renewable energy contract. The Exeter Mail installation is the largest of three contracted by the housing authorities.

Combined, the three sites exceed 13 MW, removing approximately 4,800 metric tons of greenhouse gases annually, the equivalent of taking more than 1,000 cars off the road. The market value of the generation from the three projects will be distributed among nine housing authorities in Rhode Island (Providence, North Providence, Newport, Cranston, Smithfield, Warwick, Warren, Bristol and Lincoln) in the form of utility bill credits. The credits will generate a discount against prevailing electricity supply rates, which lowers the operating budgets of the housing authorities in a region with some of the highest energy costs in the U.S. , benefiting both taxpayers and public housing families.

Located primarily in the towns of Exeter and Smithfield, the solar fields provide approximately 20 million kilowatt hours annually. The projects are estimated to save over $35 million in energy costs over the next 20 years.

Nautilus has overseen the development, permitting and construction of the solar installation. The company will now look after the ongoing management, maintenance and performance for the life of the projects, estimated at 25 to 30 years. Leveraging its deep knowledge of decarbonization, power optimization, and solar generation, Veolia was selected by PHARI to serve as a buy-side agent for the collaboration of housing authorities to manage the procurement effort, advise technically and manage the complexity of the vendor selection process.

The energy generated from the projects now feeds into the electric utility territory of Rhode Island Energy, a subsidiary of PPL Corporation. The completion of the Exeter Mail 6.5 MW field, the third of three that were contracted, marks the conclusion of this project.

Karin Hamel, President and Chief Executive Officer of Veolia's Sustainable Industries and Buildings business said: ""Veolia is proud to contribute to this transformative solar installation, which not only harnesses the power of renewable energy but also directly supports the well-being of thousands of low-income families in Rhode Island. This project aligns with Veolia's GreenUp strategy. Producing local, low-carbon energy is a critical growth booster for accelerating ecological transformation. This project is a perfect example of how green energy can be used for good.""

Jeffrey Cheng, Chief Executive Officer of Nautilus Solar said: ""This solar installation marks an important milestone in our mission to make clean energy more accessible. By delivering the benefits of community solar directly to public housing residents, we're pioneering a model that supports renewable energy goals while delivering long-term economic benefits to the local community. Rhode Island continues to be a key state for innovation in clean energy access, and we're proud to continue growing our investment in the state while building stronger, more resilient communities.""

Robert Coupe, PHARI Co-President and Executive Director of Cranston Housing Authority said: ""Every housing authority in Rhode Island is working to provide the highest quality affordable housing possible with limited budgets. Our partnership with Veolia and Nautilus dramatically reduces utility costs, freeing up valuable resources to invest in property maintenance, facility improvements and operational support. By supporting the growth of renewable energy projects, we are improving the quality of life for future generations while enhancing our ability to serve current residents.""

Feed It Onward is a voluntary program connecting farms, restaurants, grocery stores, food brands, military bases, and nonprofits already engaged in “food recovery efforts” to minimize food waste.","On September 5, 2025, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) launched Feed It Onward — a new national initiative designed to reduce food waste, strengthen food security, and support communities across the country — demonstrating EPA’s growing recognition that food waste is not just an environmental issue but an economic and social challenge with far-reaching consequences.

The Scale of the Problem

Food waste in the United States is staggering. According to a 2025 EPA report titled, “Estimating the Cost of Food Waste to American Consumers,” Americans collectively throw away more than 133 billion pounds of food annually. That translates into over $400 billion in lost value and makes food waste the single largest component of municipal landfills. On an individual level, the cost is equally striking – consumers lose an estimated $728 per person each year, or nearly $3,000 for a family of four. These losses represent roughly 11 percent of household food spending.

Beyond the financial implications, wasted food carries environmental and human costs. Decomposing food in landfills generates methane – a greenhouse gas significantly more potent than carbon dioxide. At the same time, millions of American households are food insecure, highlighting the disconnect between food supply and food access.

Feed It Onward is a voluntary program connecting farms, restaurants, grocery stores, food brands, military bases, and nonprofits already engaged in “food recovery efforts” to minimize food waste. By providing a national platform, EPA hopes to amplify success stories, promote collaboration, and inspire replication across communities.

The program reflects the values of America’s 250th anniversary celebration – generosity, grit, and community – by showcasing how everyday Americans are turning food waste into opportunity. Its launch event included a tangible example – Frey Farms delivered a truckload of fresh produce that would have otherwise gone to a landfill, providing meals for military families at Scott Air Force Base.

EPA has long emphasized waste reduction and sustainable materials management. While Feed It Onward does not create new legal mandates, it sits within a larger policy landscape where federal, state, and local governments regulate waste disposal, landfill management, and greenhouse gas emissions.

The voluntary nature of the initiative makes it more of a public-private partnership platform than a regulatory program. However, businesses and institutions that participate may benefit indirectly from reduced disposal costs, enhanced compliance with state-level waste diversion requirements, and improved ESG performance.

Aligning with EPA’s national platform can also provide reputational benefits. For companies navigating tightening state food waste laws – such as mandatory organics recycling requirements in California and New York – voluntary engagement with Feed It Onward can complement compliance efforts and demonstrate proactive corporate responsibility.

Feed It Onward underscores the intersection of environmental protection, economic efficiency, and community well-being. By offering a national platform for voluntary collaboration, EPA is positioning the program as both a celebratory initiative for America’s 250th anniversary and a practical response to one of the country’s most persistent waste challenges.

For businesses, nonprofits, and communities, participation represents not only an opportunity to reduce waste but also to strengthen relationships, improve environmental outcomes, and enhance resilience. While voluntary in design, the program may shape the broader policy conversation around food waste, sustainability, and corporate responsibility in the coming years.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.11157_2634.jpg,N,,2025-09-15 11:03:26.643810

The company recently received approval to build the Sunnyside Solar Energy Center in Fitchburg, Wisconsin, a project that will significantly expand its renewable energy portfolioHome - Madison Gas and Electric, [https://www.mge.com/][ 1 ]. Complementing this is the state's first large-scale battery storage installation, which enhances grid stability and supports the integration of intermittent renewable sourcesHome - Madison Gas and Electric, [https://www.mge.com/][ 1 ]. These projects are not isolated efforts but part of a broader strategy to diversify energy generation. For instance, MGE's Red Barn Wind Farm delivers locally generated clean energy, reducing reliance on fossil fuels while meeting regional demandHome - MGE Energy, Inc. - Madison, Wisconsin, [https://www.mgeenergy.com/][ 2 ].

The company's commitment to sustainability extends beyond generation. MGE Energy has set a clear target to achieve net-zero methane emissions from its natural gas distribution system, a critical step in reducing the climate impact of its operationsHome - MGE Energy, Inc. - Madison, Wisconsin, [https://www.mgeenergy.com/][ 2 ]. This aligns with broader industry trends, as utilities face mounting pressure to address methane leaks, which have a potent short-term warming effect. By proactively addressing this issue, MGE Energy is not only mitigating regulatory risks but also enhancing its reputation as an environmentally responsible operator.

Strategic Partnerships and Regulatory Alignment

While specific 2024–2025 regulatory filings or partnerships are not explicitly detailed in recent disclosures, MGE Energy's actions suggest a proactive approach to navigating the evolving regulatory environment. For example, the company's Columbia Energy Storage Project has been selected to receive a federal grant, underscoring its ability to secure public support for innovative infrastructureHome - MGE Energy, Inc. - Madison, Wisconsin, [https://www.mgeenergy.com/][ 2 ]. Such projects are likely to be bolstered by federal incentives like the Inflation Reduction Act, which provides tax credits for clean energy development.

MGE Energy's ownership structure also strengthens its strategic position. Through subsidiaries like Madison Gas and Electric (MGE) and investments in transmission assets via ATC LLC, the company maintains a diversified portfolio that balances regulated utility operations with growth opportunities in clean energyHome - MGE Energy, Inc. - Madison, Wisconsin, [https://www.mgeenergy.com/][ 2 ]. This structure allows MGE Energy to hedge against market volatility while capitalizing on long-term trends such as electrification and decentralized energy systems.

Shareholder Value: A Legacy of Stability and Growth

For investors, MGE Energy's appeal lies in its ability to balance environmental stewardship with financial discipline. The company has a 110-year history of paying dividends, with consecutive annual increases for over 50 yearsHome - MGE Energy, Inc. - Madison, Wisconsin, [https://www.mgeenergy.com/][ 2 ]. This track record reflects a conservative capital allocation strategy that prioritizes reliability—a critical factor in the utility sector, where earnings stability is paramount.

MGE Energy's recent financial performance further reinforces its value proposition. Despite macroeconomic headwinds, the company has maintained a consistent dividend policy and demonstrated operational efficiency, as evidenced by its recognition as the most reliable electric utility in the United StatesHome - MGE Energy, Inc. - Madison, Wisconsin, [https://www.mgeenergy.com/][ 2 ]. These accolades are not merely symbolic; they translate into customer retention, regulatory favor, and investor confidence.

Risks and Considerations

No investment is without risk. MGE Energy's reliance on state-level regulatory approvals means its clean energy projects could face delays or cost overruns. Additionally, while its methane reduction goals are ambitious, achieving net-zero emissions will require sustained capital expenditures and technological innovation. However, the company's track record of prudent investment and its alignment with national decarbonization goals suggest these challenges are manageable.

Conclusion: A Model for the Future of Utilities

MGE Energy exemplifies how a traditional utility can evolve into a clean energy leader without sacrificing shareholder value. By investing in solar, wind, and storage infrastructure, targeting emissions reductions, and maintaining a disciplined approach to capital allocation, the company is well-positioned to thrive in a low-carbon economy.

Why Battery Recycling Matters

From smartphones and laptops to e-scooters and power tools, batteries power nearly every part of daily life. Most of these rechargeable devices run on lithium-ion batteries made up of limited resources like lithium, cobalt, nickel, and manganese. When batteries are recycled, these valuable materials can be recovered and repurposed domestically, reducing reliance on global supply chains, preventing safety hazards, and strengthening America's energy future.

That mission is at the heart of Batteries Plus, which recycles more than 52 million pounds of batteries each year. By keeping thousands of tons of these materials out of landfills and in circulation, the brand helps prevent dangerous battery-related fires in waste facilities while securing critical minerals for reuse. With 730+ locations nationwide and more than three decades of recycling expertise, Batteries Plus is leading the effort to make battery recycling a simple, safe, and repeatable habit for communities everywhere.

Road ahead The IEA stresses that achieving net-zero scenarios would require green hydrogen to make up 65 per cent of global hydrogen output by 2035, up from just 1 per cent today.","Global hydrogen deployment is gathering pace, but the International Energy Agency (IEA) has warned in its Global Hydrogen Review 2025 that stronger policy support, investments and infrastructure are vital to meet net-zero goals, even as India emerges as one of the fastest movers with plans to produce 5 million tonnes (mt) annually by 2030.

The report highlights that hydrogen demand worldwide is set to rise from about 95 million tonnes (mt) today to over 180 mt by 2030, driven largely by decarbonisation commitments in heavy industry, long-haul transport and power. Yet, most of the growth so far has come from fossil-based hydrogen, and low-emission hydrogen accounts for less than 2 per cent of production.

“Hydrogen is no longer a niche discussion — it is becoming a central pillar of clean energy strategies worldwide,” said IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol. “But we need to close the gap between ambition and action.”

Clean hydrogen capacity surges but lags targets

Globally, more than 220 gigawatts (GW) of electrolyser capacity is in various stages of planning, with about 15 GW operational or under construction — a sharp increase from under 1 GW just three years ago. Electrolysers use renewable electricity to produce green hydrogen, which can slash lifecycle emissions by over 90 per cent compared to fossil hydrogen.

Still, the IEA warned that only a fraction of these projects is progressing to final investment decisions (FIDs). Supply chain constraints, permitting delays, and uncertain demand visibility are slowing momentum.

“Announced projects could deliver the volumes needed, but the reality is that too few are reaching the construction phase,” the report cautions. “Clear long-term policy signals are vital to unlock private capital.”

Investment and policy landscape strengthening

Over 50 countries now have national hydrogen strategies, while dedicated public funding pledges have crossed $280 billion through 2030. The European Union, United States, Japan, and South Korea are leading on subsidy frameworks, carbon contracts for difference, and production tax credits.

The U S Inflation Reduction Act has emerged as a game changer, offering up to $3 per kg of green hydrogen produced, while the EU has launched its Hydrogen Bank to support early projects and import corridors.

“Stable revenue mechanisms and coordinated infrastructure planning are now the decisive factors for market take-off,” the IEA said.

India ramps up Green Hydrogen ambition

Meanwhile, IEA noted that India is among the fastest movers, with the National Green Hydrogen Mission, aiming to produce 5 mt of green hydrogen annually by 2030, supported by an outlay of Rs 19,744 crore.

India is racing to establish a fully indigenous solar manufacturing ecosystem by 2028, with plans to produce not just solar modules but also cells, wafers and ingots domestically to slash import dependence, create jobs, attract investments and position India as a global clean energy powerhouse, Union Minister for New and Renewable Energy Pralhad Joshi announced on September 11, 2025.

India has already crossed 251.5 GW of non-fossil installed capacity — achieving over half of its 2030 target of 500 GW — and hit 50 per cent of total installed power capacity from non-fossil fuels five years ahead of schedule.

The country has already notified incentives for electrolyser manufacturing and green hydrogen production, while state governments such as Gujarat, Rajasthan, and Odisha are rolling out policies for dedicated renewable zones and port-based hydrogen hubs.

“India has the dual advantage of abundant renewable potential and a fast-growing industrial base,” the report observes. “If it succeeds in lowering production costs, it could become one of the world’s largest exporters.”

Companies like Reliance, Adani, NTPC, and Indian Oil have announced multi-gigawatt projects, while ports such as Mundra and Vizag are positioning to export green ammonia to Europe and Asia. However, the report warns that cost competitiveness hinges on scaling electrolysers rapidly and reducing renewable power tariffs.

Road ahead

The IEA stresses that achieving net-zero scenarios would require green hydrogen to make up 65 per cent of global hydrogen output by 2035, up from just 1 per cent today. This demands faster permitting, better infrastructure planning, and robust demand-creation policies in steel, fertilisers, shipping, and aviation.

“Hydrogen is essential to decarbonise the toughest sectors,” Birol said. “But without faster progress this decade, we risk missing our climate targets.”

The review concludes that coordinated international efforts, carbon pricing, and trade rules are critical to accelerate the clean hydrogen economy — and that India, if it executes its plans, could be one of the biggest beneficiaries of this global shift.",https://gumlet.assettype.com/downtoearth%2F2025-09-15%2F58bqyuxi%2FHydrogen.jpg?w=1200&ar=40%3A21&auto=format%2Ccompress&ogImage=true&mode=crop&enlarge=true&overlay=false&overlay_position=bottom&overlay_width=100,N,,2025-09-15 12:07:28.037834

The British government is hopeful that reaching a deal with the United States will speed up what has, so far, been a halting effort to build nuclear plants in Britain. “Together with the U.S., we are building a golden age of nuclear,” Prime Minister Keir Starmer said in a statement on Monday.

Mr. Starmer’s government favors construction of more nuclear plants despite their drawbacks. These facilities come with huge price tags and other risks, but they produce large volumes of steady energy with low emissions.

The industry’s advocates say that the benefits of having large domestic sources of power generation outweigh the negatives. “Replacing reliance on imports with domestic carbon-free power will contribute significantly to the U.K.’s energy security,” said Vincent C. Zabielski, a partner at the law firm Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman in London who works on nuclear issues.

Building nuclear stations also creates jobs, an important consideration for the government, which is aligned with the trade unions. About 98,000 people already work in the industry in Britain, constructing, operating and decommissioning plants, according to the Nuclear Industry Association, a trade group.

Britain’s existing nuclear plants are gradually reaching the end of their lives, and the country is struggling to add new ones. The last nuclear station to be completed, Sizewell B in Suffolk, began generating electricity in 1995.

Given how quickly the political winds on clean energy have shifted in the U.S. over the past year, it’s easy to lose sight of the continued momentum.

But focus on the facts, not the rhetoric, and you see the real story. Investors and companies are making choices driven by innovation, efficiency, opportunity, and profitability. And I, along with many of these leaders, will be at Climate Week in New York City next week, underscoring how seriously they’re pursuing these opportunities.

The headwinds are real, with the federal government actively opposing clean energy. And with special interests waging a politically driven campaign to force investors to ignore climate risks, introducing hundreds of state laws to control private investment strategy.

But alongside this turbulence, the market forces driving the clean economy remain undeniable. Rising energy demand and spiking costs. Weather damage topped $93 billion in just the first half of this year. Fierce global competition in markets from batteries to sustainable agriculture. And an urgent need to cut pollution and safeguard natural resources that businesses rely on.

Opportunities and choices

These forces bring both opportunities and choices for investors and businesses to double down, shape policy, and accelerate cost reductions and innovation that benefits consumers and creates good paying jobs.

They are why solar investment—the most cost effective and faster energy to deploy in the U.S. held steady this year this year in the U.S. despite federal backsliding and why more solar and battery capacity is expected to be installed in the U.S. over next three years than at any other time in the past. Texas leads the nation, ranking first in both utility-scale solar and land-based wind capacity. Globally, clean energy and grid investments are projected to reach $2.2 trillion in 2025—twice the amount expected to flow into fossil fuels this year

They are reflected in the strategic planning and capex decisions companies are making to compete in an advanced global economy and deliver returns for their investors. According to PWC, 84% of corporations are standing by their goals for cutting carbon pollution, and 37% are increasing their ambitions, because they know that climate solutions are good for business. A Morgan Stanley survey finds that 88% of companies see sustainability as a driver of long-term value, and more than 80% can track measurable ROI on their projects. Sustainability is no longer about compliance—it's about profit and resilience.

Risk management tells the same story. Some 61% of business leaders expect rising climate disruptions to create costs, with over half building adaptation and resilience into strategies. And 92% of businesses say the cost of inaction to their business will be higher than the cost of transition, compounding risk and hindering growth.

Winners and Losers

Right now, the U.S. federal government is in retreat, ceding the lead to other countries, China chief among them. The setback threatens American companies’ ability to compete and scale homegrown manufacturing in growing markets, from batteries to electric vehicles. It also creates harmful friction for utilities eager to adopt the cheapest, most readily available energy to power AI—just when the technology’s expansion depends on speed and competing demand is driving energy costs up.

Momentum alone won’t secure America’s leadership. What happens next depends on choices—by businesses and investors to press for smarter policy, expand markets, and prove that clean energy is the most competitive path forward.

Lean into the states

The biggest opportunity to sustain the clean energy boom and reduce pollution lies with the states, where forward-looking policies can help companies, investors, and consumers. For example, more than 40 businesses, including IKEA U.S, Sierra Nevada Brewing Company, and REI Co-op, are urging California to strengthen its cap-and-trade program. This market-based approach, long recognized as the most efficient and affordable way to cut carbon pollution, has fueled private investment, created good-paying jobs, funded programs that lower energy bills, and kept California competitive as the world’s fourth largest economy.

Continue championing efforts to protect core American freedoms

Since 2023, more than 400 bills have been introduced to ban investment and business strategies that consider all financial risks and opportunities in decision-making, including those related to climate risks, supply chains, and governance. Fewer than 8% have passed—largely due to fears of market distortion, higher costs, and dangerous precedent. But the push continues and so does the need to aggressively counter it.

Keep engaging on federal policy

Federal backsliding is a material setback not just for U.S. clean energy growth, but the government’s own security, energy, and manufacturing goals. Over the next year, the private sector can continue laying out this reality to Congress[SS1] . Businesses are already mobilizing to push for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to uphold the greenhouse gas Endangerment Finding to protect the stable policy environment that businesses need to invest confidently in critical 21st industries. And with Trump’s budget bill now passed, members of Congress are already acknowledging they will need to address surfacing problems.

Industry leaders can help shape solutions by advocating for policies that meet rising energy demand and combat rising electricity prices through new transmission infrastructure and permitting that includes clean energy. And by extending and simplifying wind and solar tax credits, which President Trump’s budget bill sharply curtailed.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/68c81957d1860af8beb31c15/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,N,,2025-09-15 11:01:55.598611

While the absence of 2025-specific data on recent price collapses limits immediate analysis, historical patterns and systemic vulnerabilities provide a compelling case for reevaluating the resilience of Texas's energy infrastructure and market design.

The Roots of Imbalance: Oversupply, Storage, and Infrastructure

Negative prices typically arise when supply outstrips demand and storage capacity reaches saturation. Texas, with its sprawling Permian Basin and prolific shale production, has long been a bellwether for such imbalances. In 2019, for instance, the Henry Hub in Louisiana—a key pricing point—saw prices dip into negative territory as a cold snap froze pipelines, stranding supply and overwhelming storage facilities: Texas.gov | The Official Website of the State of Texas[ 1 ]. While Texas's own grid (managed by ERCOT) is geographically and politically isolated, its natural gas infrastructure faces similar constraints.

The state's reliance on just-in-time delivery systems, rather than robust storage infrastructure, exacerbates volatility. According to a 2023 report by the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), Texas's natural gas working gas in storage remains below the five-year average, leaving the system vulnerable to sudden shifts in supply or demand. This fragility is compounded by the rapid growth of renewable energy. Wind power, which accounts for over 40% of Texas's electricity generation during peak periods, can lead to sudden surges in energy supply, further depressing gas prices when grid flexibility is insufficient to absorb the excess.

Infrastructure Bottlenecks: A System in Perpetual Strain

Texas's energy infrastructure, though historically robust, is increasingly strained by its own success. The state's “energy-only” market model, which relies on short-term price signals rather than long-term investment incentives, has left critical bottlenecks unaddressed. For example, the lack of interconnections between ERCOT and neighboring grids limits the ability to export surplus energy during periods of oversupply. A 2024 analysis by the Rhodium Group noted that such isolation amplifies price distortions, as Texas cannot easily balance its market with broader regional trends.

Pipeline constraints further compound the issue. The state's natural gas gathering and transmission systems, while extensive, were not designed for the scale of production seen in the 21st century. During periods of high production, especially in regions like the Permian, the cost of transporting gas to market can exceed its value, leading producers to curtail output or, in extreme cases, pay buyers to take the gas. This dynamic, as highlighted by BloombergNEF in 2023, is a harbinger of systemic risk: when infrastructure lags behind production, the entire market becomes prone to cascading failures.

The Tipping Point: Policy and Investment Imperatives

The question is no longer whether Texas will face another episode of negative pricing but when—and how prepared the system will be. The 2021 winter storm Uri, which caused catastrophic power outages, exposed the state's vulnerability to extreme weather and inadequate infrastructure hardening. Yet, as of 2025, progress on long-term solutions remains uneven.

Investors must weigh the risks of continued underinvestment in storage, grid interconnections, and demand-side management against the potential for regulatory intervention. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has signaled growing concern over regional market imbalances, with a 2024 order urging states to adopt more resilient market designs. However, Texas's political landscape, which resists federal oversight, complicates such efforts.

Conclusion: A Call for Systemic Resilience

Negative natural gas prices in Texas are not an isolated event but a warning shot for the U.S. energy sector. They underscore the urgent need to align infrastructure investment with the realities of a decarbonizing, digitizing, and increasingly volatile energy landscape. For investors, the lesson is clear: portfolios must account for the interplay of market design, physical infrastructure, and regulatory inertia. Without systemic reforms, the next tipping point may not be a question of if, but how severely the system will falter.",https://cdn.ainvest.com/aigc/hxcmp/images/compress-aime_generated_1757944331070.jpg.png,N,,2025-09-15 14:02:04.034969

India stands at the crossroads in its path to energy sovereignty with fossil fuels continuing to contribute 68 per cent to electricity production. In 2024 alone, the electricity sector released over 1.4 billion tonnes of CO2 and the nation spent almost $60 billion importing petroleum. Simultaneously, India has become a clean energy global leader with more than 135 GW of solar and 50 GW of wind capacity having been installed by March 2025. Wind installations contributed 1.8 GW during Q1 FY 2025, solidifying the country’s position as the world’s fourth-largest market in the space. To remain a global energy leader, it needs to ramp up the capacity to 100 GW of wind and 500 GW of non-fossil fuel by 2030.

The key is scaling up renewables and creating a strong, resilient, future-proof power system that incorporates wind, solar, storage, and smart grids to meet industrial, commercial, and domestic demand — 24/7. It is not just about increasing the capacity but also about providing clean, dependable, affordable power that powers industries, homes, and growth.

Clean energy is now cheaper and smarter

The energy economics have shifted. The cost of wind power is now Rs 3.17 per kWh, lower than coal-powered electricity, which is at Rs 3.50 per kWh. The cost of solar power is lower in many states. With hybrid technologies that integrate wind, solar and storage, renewable energy (RE) now offers firm dispatchable renewable energy (FDRE) that matches fossil fuels on both cost and reliability parameters.

India’s commercial and industrial (C&I) sector, which consumed USD60 billion of fossil fuels in FY 2024, is proactively switching to renewables in order to reduce emissions and manage fuel price volatility. With C&I electricity demand expected to grow 40 per cent by 2040, the transition to green power will be imperative. Enhancing the share of FDRE can reduce 95 million tonnes of CO2 a year, help in complying with international decarbonisation requirements, such as the EU Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism, and make Indian exports competitive worldwide.

Addressing the grid and storage gaps

As capacity generation increases, bottlenecks continue to persist. Grid congestion, land acquisition delays, and slow approvals continue to hold back RE deployment. In light of this, India’s high-renewable energy states need transmission upgrade urgently, catalysed by schemes such as the Green Energy Corridor.

The new frontier is energy storage. India is planning to install 50 GW of storage capacity by 2030 using battery energy storage systems (BESS), pumped hydro, and innovative green hydrogen solutions. These technologies are key to spanning intermittency and ensuring 24/7 green power for industry.

Digitalisation is also critical as AI-driven forecasting applications that can reduce land acquisition timelines by 30 per cent and intelligent grid systems that provide real-time load balancing and demand response.

Wind, solar, offshore and repowering

India holds 695 GW of wind potential at 120m hub height, including 174 GW offshore in Gujarat and Tamil Nadu. A planned 100 MW offshore pilot by 2027 can unlock a new frontier. Repowering old wind sites alone could yield 25 GW of new capacity. New low-wind speed turbine technology is making previously unviable geographies viable, while floating solar and canal-top installations are optimising space use.

A thriving domestic ecosystem and global backing

The country’s renewable energy push is backed by a robust domestic manufacturing base, now producing 25 GW of solar modules and 20 GW of wind turbines annually. This not only reduces import dependence but also creates jobs. The wind sector alone added 90,000 jobs in FY 2025, with over 360,000 clean energy jobs expected by 2030.

India is also attracting serious global capital. In June 2024, the World Bank approved USD1.5 billion to support its clean energy transition, underlining international confidence in the roadmap.

The road ahead: Integration, not isolation

The future isn’t wind versus solar or fossil versus renewable – it is integration. Powering a USD5 trillion economy requires a systemic approach that combines generation, storage, transmission, and digital intelligence.

India has the scale, the market, and the will. What it needs now is speed: fast-tracked tenders, plug-and-play industrial green zones, forward-looking policies, and agile execution. We can either retrofit yesterday’s systems or build tomorrow’s power architecture today, rooted in clean, firm and sustainable energy.

The country’s energy revolution isn’t on the horizon. It is already here. Let’s lead it.",https://powerline.net.in/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/52.jpg,N,,2025-09-15 12:06:20.023489

Conclusion The DER value stack has matured into a sophisticated, multi-dimensional framework that continues to evolve alongside the global energy transition.
Richard Zdunkewicz is CEO of Distributed Energy Clearinghouse®, a provider of next generation analytics for the distributed energy value stack and DER investments in all markets across the United States.","The term “value stack” refers to the combination of economic, reliability, and sustainability benefits that DERs provide. Unlike centralized power plants, which generate value primarily by selling electricity into wholesale markets, DERs deliver multiple benefits simultaneously.

One of the most immediate sources of value is energy cost savings. By generating electricity on-site with solar or by reducing consumption through efficiency, customers can reduce their reliance on utility-supplied power. This offsets retail consumption and reduces overall energy bills. Closely tied to this are demand charge reductions, particularly for commercial and industrial (C&I) customers who are often billed based on their peak demand. By lowering peak load through demand management and storage, businesses can avoid substantial charges.

Financial incentives and tax benefits further strengthen the economics of DERs. Federal tax credits, state renewable energy incentives, and accelerated depreciation can all reduce the effective cost of projects, making them more attractive to buyers. Beyond customer-level economics, DERs can also participate in grid services and wholesale markets. Batteries, flexible loads, and aggregated resources can provide valuable services such as frequency regulation, capacity, and ancillary support that help stabilize the grid. As battery storage technologies improve yielding faster charge times and longer durations, the market will increasingly accept batteries as reliable resources and value them accordingly.

Another essential layer of the value stack is resilience and reliability. For many buyers, especially those operating hospitals, data centers, or manufacturing plants, the ability to keep operations running during an outage can outweigh traditional financial considerations. Though difficult to quantify, the avoided cost of downtime can be significant. Finally, sustainability and ESG goals are increasingly part of corporate strategies. DERs contribute directly to decarbonization, help companies comply with regulatory mandates, and support brand reputation by demonstrating environmental leadership.

The precise makeup of the value stack varies widely depending on region, utility rate design, policy framework, and the specific load profile of each customer. A battery in one market may generate wholesale market revenues through frequency regulation, while in another, the very same battery might deliver greater value through demand response and enhanced resilience.

Rapid evolution

Over the past decade, DER economics shifted from simple payback calculations to complex, multi-dimensional revenue models. This evolution has been driven by a combination of regulatory shifts, expanded market opportunities, technological advances, and changing customer priorities.

From a regulatory perspective, many states are transitioning from net metering to net billing. Under net metering, exported solar energy was often compensated at the full retail rate, but under net billing, exported energy is valued at avoided cost or wholesale market rates. This shift reduces the economics of solar-only systems and elevates the importance of storage and demand management. Similarly, the introduction of dynamic tariffs such as time-of-use pricing and real-time pricing creates both risks and opportunities, rewarding those who can shift load or store and dispatch energy strategically.

Market participation has also expanded. FERC Order 2222 opened wholesale markets to aggregated DERs, allowing distributed resources to compete alongside centralized generation. This has paved the way for the rapid rise of VPPs, which pool together DERs from multiple sites to deliver system-level services. These market structures are still in development, but they signal a fundamental shift in how distributed resources are valued.

Technological advances have accelerated this evolution. Forecasting capabilities, AI-driven optimization, and cloud-based platforms make it possible to model DER performance with unprecedented precision. These tools enable simulations of different scenarios, quantify risks, and optimize dispatch strategies across multiple value streams simultaneously.

Finally, customer priorities are changing. For critical facilities, resilience and reliability have become top priorities, sometimes even surpassing economic savings. At the same time, sustainability is no longer a peripheral concern but central to corporate decision-making. Many companies are setting carbon reduction targets and using DERs as a strategy to achieve them. The result of all these forces is a DER value stack that is dynamic, region-specific, and increasingly sensitive to regulatory and market conditions.

Transparency

In today’s complex DER markets, sellers cannot rely on black-box sales pitches. Without transparency, three main risks emerge. First, mismatched expectations can occur when buyers overestimate savings or underestimate risks. This leads to disappointment, erodes trust, and can damage seller reputations. Second, investors may deploy capital into projects with inflated forecasts, resulting in inefficient allocation of resources and weakening overall confidence in the sector. Third, overstated claims about project returns could invite regulatory scrutiny, slowing down innovation and increasing compliance costs.

Transparency is the antidote to these risks. Robust tools and transparent methodologies allow sellers to show their work by making assumptions explicit and disclosing the models behind their projections. Transparency also enables sellers to highlight risks proactively, including tariff changes, performance degradation, or the expiration of incentives. Equally important, transparency provides buyers with a basis for comparability, making it easier to evaluate competing offers on equal terms. In a crowded and competitive market, transparency is no longer just good practice; it is a competitive advantage and the foundation for building long-term trust.

Buyers benefit

For commercial and institutional customers, understanding the DER value stack enables more informed and resilient decision-making. By demanding transparency, buyers can require detailed breakdowns of projected savings, revenues, and risks. This ensures that sellers cannot gloss over unfavorable assumptions and creates accountability in the sales process.

Buyers who take the time to stress-test assumptions gain further advantages. By evaluating what happens under different scenarios — such as changes to tariff structures, the reduction of incentives, or underperformance in wholesale markets — they can better understand the range of possible outcomes and reduce exposure to downside risks.

Moreover, a focus on the value stack allows buyers to think beyond simple payback metrics. DERs can provide substantial value through enhanced resilience, contributions to ESG goals, and participation in new markets that may open in the near future. By aligning DER investments with broader corporate priorities such as carbon neutrality, cost stability, and operational resilience, buyers ensure that energy projects serve both financial and strategic goals.

Finally, many buyers benefit from leveraging advanced analytical tools or advisors who can model projects rigorously. These tools provide clarity and help uncover value streams that might otherwise be overlooked. When buyers understand the value stack, negotiations shift from vague promises to data-driven clarity, leading to better outcomes and fewer surprises.

Continued evolution

The next decade promises even greater complexity and opportunity. Several developments are likely to define this period. First, the value of grid services is expected to increase as renewable penetration grows and flexibility becomes more important. DERs that can provide fast, dispatchable services will play a critical role in stabilizing the grid.

Second, VPPs will become more widely deployed and more deeply integrated into capacity planning and reliability markets. As market operators become more comfortable with aggregated resources, VPPs will transition from pilot projects to core components of the energy system.

Third, carbon valuation will become a significant factor. Whether through explicit carbon pricing mechanisms or implicit valuation via ESG reporting requirements, carbon attributes will be monetized and included in project valuations.

Fourth, electrification across sectors will create new opportunities. The adoption of electric vehicle fleets, the electrification of heating, and increased industrial electrification will introduce new sources of flexible demand that DERs can integrate with.

Finally, digitalization will advance, with AI-driven optimization becoming a standard tool for unlocking value streams that were previously too complex to access. Together, these trends make clear that the value stack is a moving target that will expand and diversify, requiring increasingly sophisticated analysis.

Flexibility, resilience, carbon reduction

The future sources of value will extend well beyond today’s bill savings. Flexibility markets will reward DERs that can deliver fast, dispatchable balancing services, helping grid operators manage variability from renewable generation. As climate and cyber risks continue to rise, resilience premiums will grow. For many businesses, the ability to maintain operations during an outage will become more valuable than simple energy savings.

Carbon credits and reporting value will also expand. As decarbonization goals become mandatory in more sectors, companies will increasingly monetize carbon reductions through voluntary or regulated markets. DERs that can demonstrate carbon benefits will be particularly attractive. In addition, DERs will contribute to community-scale value. Microgrids, peer-to-peer trading, and resilience hubs will provide shared benefits at the local level, further broadening the appeal of distributed energy solutions.

Finally, integrated load management will emerge as a frontier for value creation. By coordinating DERs with electric vehicles, smart buildings, and industrial processes, system operators and customers alike will unlock new efficiencies. These emerging layers of value reinforce the importance of robust modeling and transparent methodologies, as the risks of mispricing and overestimating benefits will only grow with increased complexity.

Support to navigate complexity

Navigating the DER landscape can be daunting, but new platforms and services are rising to meet the challenge. Advanced software tools such as that offered by Distributed Energy Clearinghouse® can now model complex tariffs, simulate wholesale market participation, and assess risks with increasing accuracy. The DECH platform features intuitive dashboards and scenario modeling, making it easier for decision-makers to interpret results.

Independent consultants continue to play a vital role by bringing expertise in energy economics, regulatory frameworks, and project finance. Buyers who lack internal expertise can rely on these advisors to ensure projects are evaluated rigorously. Industry associations and standards bodies are also contributing by publishing guidelines and methodologies that promote consistent valuation practices. Finally, collaborative marketplaces are emerging as trusted environments where buyers, sellers, and investors can transact with greater transparency and comparability.

For buyers, the key takeaway is to insist on open, transparent methodologies. For sellers, the imperative is to adopt tools and practices that foster comparability and trust. Together, these actions will strengthen the market and ensure that the full potential of DERs is realized.

Conclusion

The DER value stack has matured into a sophisticated, multi-dimensional framework that continues to evolve alongside the global energy transition. Transparency is now the critical ingredient that aligns buyers, sellers, and investors. Sellers who adopt robust, transparent tools will differentiate themselves in an increasingly competitive marketplace and build long-term customer relationships. Buyers who demand transparency will capture greater value and future-proof their organizations against uncertainty.

The future of the DER value stack is one of expansion, complexity, and opportunity. Those who embrace transparency today will be best positioned to capture tomorrow’s benefits.

Statkraft reported 238GWh of solar production from 307MW of installed capacity in 2024, with plans to develop over 2GW of solar by 2025. The company manages a 10GW global pipeline of wind and solar projects across Europe and Latin America, focusing on expanding its renewable portfolio in key international markets.

The company entered India in 2004 through its joint venture SN Power, becoming the country’s first foreign investor in hydropower. Over the past two decades, Statkraft has built a diversified renewable portfolio across solar, wind, hydro, and power trading in multiple states.

Meanwhile, Serentica Renewables has achieved 1GW of renewable energy capacity across multiple Indian states, integrating solar, wind, and energy storage. The company is backed by US$650 million from global investment firm KKR, supporting its expansion in clean energy solutions.",https://www.pv-tech.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Statkraft.jpg,N,,2025-09-15 12:06:34.986069

EV Credits Almost Gone

The IRC § 25E Previously-owned Clean Vehicles Credit and the IRC § 30D New Clean Vehicle Credit both terminate September 30, 2025, meaning neither credit will be allowed for vehicles acquired after that date.

Originally set to expire after 2032, the OBBBA signed July 4 expedited the sunset of the clean vehicle credits, or the ‘EV’ credits as they are often referred to. Amended by the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022, the credits served to incentivize car buyers to go in an eco-friendlier direction but came with detailed eligibility requirements.

The Section 30D EV credit provides up to $7,500 for the purchase of qualifying new plug-in EVs and fuel cell vehicles. But it is split into two $3,750 components: one for meeting a critical minerals requirement and one for meeting a battery component requirement.

Eligible vehicles must have a battery capacity of at least 7 kWh, be manufactured by a qualified manufacturer, have final assembly in North America, and not exceed certain MSRP thresholds ($80,000 for vans/SUVs/pickups; $55,000 for other vehicles).

The used vehicle credit under Section 25E provides up to $4,000 (or 30% of the sale price, if less) for the purchase of eligible used electric or fuel cell vehicles from a dealer for $25,000 or less.

It is subject to income limits and other eligibility requirements for both the vehicle and the buyer. Both credits are non-refundable and must be claimed on Form 8936, Clean Vehicle Credit.

Economic Impact

According to Baker Tilly Principal Michael Mader, July and August were “very strong EV sales months” because of the OBBBA’s change to the credits’ expiration date. Customers are hurrying to buy eligible vehicles before the end of September, while dealerships are working to move their inventories and keep pace with this temporary spike in demand, Mader told Checkpoint.

With the deadline less than three weeks away, dealerships are using the credits to bring in foot traffic to showrooms, although customers basing their decision to buy around the expected value of a credit will not need convincing.

He noted that the new vehicle credit has a cap of $80,000 while the used vehicle credit maximum is $25,000. “A customer that was going to buy an EV used needs to find one that’s priced at $25,000 and they’re going to pay [$21,000]” if they buy this month.

Afterwards, “they’re going to pay $25,000 for that vehicle, because that credit’s not there.”

This will trigger a “shift in the market,” said Mader. “There’s going to be a drop after September 30, and then it’s going to come back to normalization again.”

Tips for Taxpayers

While buyers may have several questions about the credits, their worth, and how to claim them, Mader said it is ultimately the taxpayer’s responsibility to “educate themselves on the EV that they are considering, and what are their proximities to charging stations.” And, he continued, if there are charging stations, are they compatible? “Because some vehicles take special charging hookups and some don’t.”

Prospective buyers should also factor in how long they plan on owning the vehicle and if the value of the credit is worth it right now. While waiting will cause a taxpayer to miss out on these credits, Mader said the EV technology may improve down the line and become more attractive to that customer later.

But for those who are ready to buy now and have done their homework on eligibility, the advice is: “Don’t hesitate.”

The IRS in recently issued FAQs (FS 2025-05) seemed to indicate that “it’s possible you could take delivery after September 30 to get the credit” so long as the payment was made and the contract was signed beforehand. But Mader suggested that taxpayers not take the risk on possibly losing out on a credit, just in case.

Other advice Mader had for those considering an EV included ensuring the dealer is registered to the IRS portal for submitting documentation. Taxpayers cannot claim the credits if the dealership is not registered.

“You need to have [a Form 8936] and the time of sale report,” he said. “Make sure when you walk out of the dealership, you’ve got your time of sale report.”",https://tax.thomsonreuters.com/news/wp-content/themes/tac/assets/media/favicon.png,N,,2025-09-15 11:03:30.683961

Its policy moves are slowing the momentum of solar energy and may result in increased costs and security risks.

What's happening?

As EnergySage reported, solar power is affordable and scalable despite the federal government subsidies expiring at the end of the year. EnergySage is an objective, independent source of solar industry expertise, offering free tools to compare quotes and receive quick installation estimates.

A Lazard report revealed that solar and wind energy are the most affordable sources of new electricity in America. Meanwhile, gas costs are increasing, and the cost of building a new gas-powered plant is significantly higher than that of a new solar-powered one.

""Lazard's latest Levelized Cost of Energy+ analysis found that gas plant construction is at its most expensive point in a decade, driven by record-high electricity demand and a growing shortage of equipment like turbines,"" EnergySage's Casey McDevitt wrote.

EnergySage also highlighted the fact that America's backtracking on clean energy puts the country at a competitive disadvantage to China. With increasing energy demands resulting from the growth of artificial intelligence and data centers, the U.S. could miss opportunities to advance the latest technologies because of grid limitations.

Meanwhile, clean power is essential to energy independence and less reliance on foreign providers. National security and economic competitiveness are at stake for nations that fail to adopt energy solutions that are cheaper and quicker to build than gas and other pollution-heavy energy sources.

Why is reverting to gas problematic?

Curbing and reversing progress on clean energy momentum is concerning because the alternative is reverting to outdated, nonrenewable resources that harm the environment.

Gas emits high rates of methane and pollution when burned, exacerbating our climate crisis. It relies on aging infrastructure, is becoming more expensive to use, and makes the U.S. less secure and competitive.

Clean, renewable energy sources have been growing steadily, benefiting both people and the planet. However, recent political actions risk reversing that progress by ignoring promising innovations and halting large-scale projects that could put the country in a more sustainable position.

What's being done to advance the clean energy transition?

Despite what is happening at the federal level, there are still many things that you can do to live a sustainable life and set an example for people around you.

For example, you can reduce your personal reliance on the grid by installing solar panels on your home and pairing them with a backup battery system. EnergySage provides a mapping tool to help you maximize the benefits of all available solar incentives tailored to your location.

To take it a step further, you can pair solar panels with energy-efficient home appliances and a heat pump to lower your utility bills and reduce household pollution.

You can also set a positive example for others by driving a clean energy vehicle and using public transportation when possible.

When local and state elections are coming up where you live, step up to be an advocate for clean energy policies and influence legislation from a grassroots level. In many places, pro-climate lawmakers are still working hard to advance the clean energy transition for the benefit of our people and the planet.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/oUL5BnBNp3l8o95lTIMZoQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_cool_down_737/4ac5145e4a25beb21b87587ae55b4265,N,,2025-09-15 11:02:58.587168

Lithium, the cornerstone of battery production for electric vehicles (EVs), has become a strategic asset, with the U.S. government prioritizing domestic production to reduce reliance on foreign imports. At the forefront of this effort is Lithium Americas, whose Thacker Pass project in Nevada has emerged as a linchpin in the Biden administration's push for energy independence. With a production target of 40,000 tonnes of battery-grade lithium carbonate annually by late 2027, the project could redefine the U.S. lithium landscape—if it meets its ambitious timelines and cost projections.

Strategic Funding and Partnerships: A Blueprint for Scale

Lithium Americas' Thacker Pass project has secured a robust funding package, reflecting both private-sector confidence and federal support. The company recently finalized a $250 million investment from Orion Resource Partners LP, structured as a mix of convertible debt, production-linked payments, and a delayed draw facility Lithium Americas Reports 2024 Full Year Results, [https://www.lithiumamericas.com/news/news-details/2025/Lithium-Americas-Reports-2024-Full-Year-Results/default.aspx][ 1 ]. This is complemented by a landmark $2.26 billion loan from the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), with the first draw anticipated in Q3 2025 Lithium Americas Secures Full Funding for Thacker Pass, [https://www.stocktitan.net/news/LAC/lithium-americas-reports-first-quarter-2025-f1kfc57u9qyp.html][ 2 ]. Such backing underscores the project's alignment with national priorities, particularly the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which allocates billions to decarbonize transportation and strengthen domestic mineral processing.

Equally significant is the partnership with

(GM), which has committed $100 million to the project as part of a final investment decision (FID) agreement. This collaboration not only de-risks capital expenditures but also ensures a stable off-take agreement for a key U.S. automaker. By 2027, when production is slated to begin, GM's EV ambitions will require a reliable domestic lithium supply chain—a need Thacker Pass is uniquely positioned to fulfill.

Production Capacity and Economic Impact

With a projected output of 40,000 tonnes of lithium carbonate annually, Thacker Pass could account for a substantial share of U.S. demand. While exact figures for domestic consumption are not publicly available, industry analysts estimate that achieving 40,000 tonnes of annual production would cover a significant portion of the lithium required for EV battery manufacturing in North America. This scale is critical: the U.S. currently imports over 90% of its lithium, with China dominating processing and refining. Thacker Pass's success would reduce this dependency, insulating the U.S. from geopolitical volatility and supply bottlenecks.

Economically, the project is expected to create thousands of jobs during construction and hundreds of permanent roles in operations. Nevada, already a hub for mining and renewable energy, stands to benefit from a new industrial ecosystem centered on lithium processing and battery manufacturing. The state's political leadership has actively supported the project, recognizing its potential to diversify the economy and align with federal clean energy goals.

Challenges and Strategic Risks

Despite its promise, Thacker Pass faces hurdles. Environmental permitting delays and community concerns over land use have historically plagued large-scale mining projects in the U.S. While Lithium Americas has navigated these challenges thus far, any setbacks could push back the 2027 timeline or inflate costs. Additionally, the project's reliance on federal loans exposes it to policy shifts—though the bipartisan nature of the Infrastructure Law suggests long-term stability.

From a market perspective, the project must also contend with global oversupply risks. As Australia, Chile, and Argentina expand production, lithium prices could face downward pressure. However, the U.S. market's unique demand dynamics—driven by EV adoption and regulatory mandates—may insulate Thacker Pass from broader price swings.

A Model for U.S. Self-Sufficiency

Thacker Pass represents more than a mining operation; it is a test case for whether the U.S. can build a vertically integrated lithium supply chain. The project's alignment with the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, coupled with strategic partnerships and federal financing, positions it as a blueprint for future mineral projects. If successful, it could catalyze further investments in processing and refining, closing the loop on a supply chain that has long been fragmented.

For investors, the stakes are high.

It ​“was the perfect project to show the art of what’s possible,” said Dennis Pietrocola, director of operations services at the Port Authority.
The Port Authority didn’t use any incentives to cover the expenses, in part because the team needed to act quickly to replace the building’s worn-out systems.
Pietrocola plans to apply the lessons learned at Building One to other Port Authority structures as their fossil-fueled systems age out, he said.
Decarbonizing buildings ​“is a very important cause to me, personally and professionally,” Pietrocola noted.","The first passenger terminal for air travel in the U.S. was an Art Deco celebration of aviation. In 1935, the fearless Amelia Earhart dedicated the building at the busy airport now known as Newark Liberty International, and within a few years, hundreds of thousands of passengers were hurrying through its marble-and-terrazzo lobby to catch commercial flights.

Now an administrative center called Building One, the former terminal has made history for a new reason: It’s the first edifice owned by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, a bistate transportation agency, to undergo an all-electric retrofit.

“It’s so exciting to see [this kind of] reinvestment and making things new again,” said James Lindberg, senior policy director at the nonprofit National Trust for Historic Preservation, who wasn’t involved in the project. ​“Energy efficiency and decarbonization is part of that. … We know how to do it — we just need more of it.”

Buildings account for a whopping one-third of the nation’s carbon pollution. Every building — even the 80,000 structures that, like Building One, are listed in the National Register of Historic Places — must break up with fossil fuels to align with a cooler climate future.

Retrofitting any existing structure is going to be tougher than going with all-electric systems from the start. But engineers looking to upgrade historic buildings are doubly constrained by the need to maintain their charges’ distinctive architectural features; you can’t just tear down the walls of a landmark.

The Port Authority’s Building One is an early example demonstrating that storied buildings can be electrified — all while keeping their vaunted status intact.

It ​“was the perfect project to show the art of what’s possible,” said Dennis Pietrocola, director of operations services at the Port Authority. ​“If we were able to undergo an electrification transformation to Building One” — among the most challenging of the Port Authority’s structures — ​“then it sets the stage for [decarbonizing] the rest.”

That’s coming. The Port Authority aims to be carbon neutral by 2050, a goal that includes its entire portfolio of more than 1,000 buildings — from storage and parking structures to terminals to offices — at its airports, bridges, tunnels, railways, bus stops, and shipping ports.

Heat pumps, electric boilers, and more

Building One is the bustling home base of 190 Port Authority employees, including operations and maintenance workers, police, and firefighters. In 2023, the building’s gas-fueled equipment was ready to conk out, making it a prime candidate for a decarbonization retrofit. Pietrocola and his colleagues carefully planned a series of cost-effective electrifying updates and hired an experienced general contractor, Constellation NewEnergy, to carry them out.

The team installed five large heat pumps on the roof to provide zero-emissions heating and cooling. They put in an energy-recovery system to recycle waste heat from the locker and IT rooms. The crew added a system that can dial down power use when the grid is strained by high demand. And in the parking lot, workers installed 29 new charging ports for electric vehicles.

The team also swapped the building’s gas boilers with electric-resistance ones. Operating with the same physics as big electric tea kettles, these provide an extra boost as needed to the building’s water-based heating system. Pietrocola had considered using heat-pump boilers instead, which can be twice as efficient because they move heat instead of making it, but he nixed the idea because it would’ve meant replacing the hydronic system’s distribution pipes with bigger ones.

Workers also made some more staid updates to lower energy costs: weatherizing the building, applying heat-blocking films on the windows, and replacing more than 1,500 light fixtures with ultra-efficient LEDs.

In total, the project took 18 months and cost about $15 million — $3 million more than it would’ve had the Port Authority stuck with gas-fired equipment, according to Pietrocola.

The Port Authority didn’t use any incentives to cover the expenses, in part because the team needed to act quickly to replace the building’s worn-out systems. But federal and state tax credits are available to private entities and public-private partnerships to electrify operations as part of renovation projects, Lindberg pointed out. Unlike the consumer credits for heat pumps, EVs, and other clean energy tech, the Rehabilitation Credit was left unscathed by Republicans’ federal budget law enacted this summer, he said.

Building One’s retrofit has slashed energy use by about 25%, Pietrocola said. Still, due to the area’s relatively high cost of electricity, he doesn’t expect the structure’s utility bills to fall.

Pietrocola plans to apply the lessons learned at Building One to other Port Authority structures as their fossil-fueled systems age out, he said. He’ll approach each project with a fresh eye to the building’s particular needs and the technology available. Next time, he added, the agency may go with hydronic heat pumps instead of the electric-resistance boilers.

Decarbonizing buildings ​“is a very important cause to me, personally and professionally,” Pietrocola noted. Recently, he worked with his 14-year-old daughter, Kayla, on a climate-change science project. ​“It made me realize, well, I’m part of the problem — the way I’ve operated facilities [in the past], perhaps with a closed mind.” After guiding the electrification of one of the country’s most storied structures, he feels like he’s become part of the solution.",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/image.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=580bbe9fe179523053d193a1379689af,N,,2025-09-15 12:05:59.545237

Solar Energy UK has also stepped up, with the formation of the Solar Careers UK initiative, which will provide information and guidance on what skills and competences are needed for jobs in the sector and how to attain them.
Solar Energy UK will work with other trade bodies on how to attract and retain newly trained installers and prepare teaching materials for schools.
Solar Energy UK has committed to working with the planning profession to ensure that training is fit for purpose.","A new era of clean energy independence dawned in early July, with the publication of the UK’s highly anticipated Solar Roadmap [1].

The government-industry paper describes 62 practical measures to boost the supply of cheaper and more secure power, deliver new industries and create skilled jobs – all while providing significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and gains in biodiversity. By addressing issues such as the electricity grid, supply chain, skills and planning, it will play a major role in delivering the British Labour government’s mission for the UK to become a clean energy superpower and meet – or potentially exceed – the capacity goals set out in December’s Clean Power 2030 Action Plan.

By then, we could see around 9 million small-scale rooftop installations, up from 2 million now, with the sector supporting 35,000 jobs – almost twice the number of today. Meanwhile, solar farms would still take up a tiny amount of the country, put at significantly less than 1% of farmland.

The roadmap was produced over two years and two governments by the Solar Taskforce, led by secretary of state for energy security and net zero, Ed Miliband, and Solar Energy UK, and supported by leading figures from across the solar industry and related sectors. The taskforce will shortly transition into the Solar Council, set to drive future progress and guide the implementation of the plan.

Writing in a foreword to the roadmap, the secretary of state wrote: “This is an incredibly exciting time for solar in our country. More than 1.5 million homes across Britain now have solar installed, and since this government came to office my department has consented almost 3GW of nationally significant solar projects – nearly three times as much as the previous 14 years combined. But we know we need to go further to deliver our goals for clean power by 2030 and beyond

“Solar offers huge potential to boost our energy independence, bring down bills and tackle the climate crisis. It also presents significant economic opportunities; we estimate that around 35,000 jobs supported by solar will be needed by 2030, a doubling of today’s number.”

Added to those reflections, solar energy is among the lowest-cost and most popular forms of power generation in the UK. Unlocking its potential will increase Britain’s energy security, drive down bills and be a major contributor to preventing dangerous climate change. The fact that it can be deployed rapidly in so many ways, from household rooftops to warehouses to reservoirs and large-scale solar farms, is the key ingredient to this potential.

Rooftop

Despite enormous cost reductions over recent years, one key barrier to more widespread adoption of rooftop photovoltaics remains their upfront cost. So, the government will work with the Green Finance Institute, the finance sector, consumer bodies and the solar sector itself to provide financial solutions for all customers.

The taskforce also identified an ongoing lack of awareness of the benefits of both domestic and commercial solar energy as a further obstacle, with potential buyers unaware of trusted sources of information. Accordingly, the government will update its Energy Efficient Home website to promote solar deployment. Meanwhile, the UK Warehousing Association has agreed to develop a toolkit for the commercial-scale market, including how to obtain a power purchase agreement.

How solar is reflected in energy performance certificates will be updated next year, and incentives to install solar energy will be considered for social landlords. Meanwhile, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors will ensure that the value of solar homes is assessed properly, while incentives to install solar power on social housing will be considered.

As may be expected, the paper also mentions the recently confirmed Future Homes Standard. This should, alongside the forthcoming Future Buildings Standard, virtually mandate solar on new properties. In due course, retrofit customers will benefit from a review of consumer protections, so they can have confidence in the quality of work when upgrading their homes.

Warehousing has huge potential to expand solar generation but faces many barriers [2]. To resolve these, the UK Warehousing Association will collaborate with the real estate and solar sectors to overcome problems with building leases, develop standard contracts for landlords and tenants and develop a standard approach for building valuation. The connection processes of independent distribution network operators (DNOs), which often operate power systems in business parks, will be reviewed and the regulation of the sector reconsidered by the regulator, Ofgem.

According to government estimates, only around one in five schools have solar panels, leaving them paying for power rather than investing in the nation’s youth. To help remedy this, the government will commit to supporting schools to deploy the technology, possibly through the DESNZ’s ‘one stop shop’ Net Zero Accelerator Service, building on the newly founded, publicly funded clean energy company GB Energy’s recent investment in 200 schools, in which it plans to spend £180 million on investing in 70-100MW of PV on schools and hospitals.

Supporting its anticipated Local Power Plan, GB Energy will provide “funding, capacity and capability support at all stages of project development”, to drive the growth of community energy, building on the Local Net Zero Hubs Programme. In parallel, the National Wealth Fund also offers free advice and low-cost, long-term finance to local authority infrastructure projects that align with net-zero and economic growth mandates, which includes the development of solar projects.

Meanwhile, the National Wealth Fund will “explore potential structures to finance solar projects or portfolios”. The Department of Business and Trade will coordinate a cross-government steering group to “consider potential government intervention” to promote corporate power purchase agreements – buying power directly from solar farms, at a significant discount from the grid.

A study into the safety of small-scale solar energy systems that can be plugged directly into the domestic mains supply will also commence. Current UK regulations forbid them, although they are increasingly popular on the Continent.

Grid access

Excessive waiting times for electricity grid connections have long been the bane of the solar industry, for both ground-mounted and large-scale rooftop systems.

The Solar Roadmap spells out a series of measures to address the issue, in parallel with reforms arising from the Winser Review and raising transmission impact assessment thresholds. These include adopting a common definition of commercially sensitive data, which should provide a better understanding of which projects are most likely to proceed. Ofgem will also consider introducing standards to improve levels of service after grid connections are accepted, with the UK’s National Energy System Operator (NESO) conducting a series of technical measures to improve transmission impact assessments.

As things stand, solar projects above 3.68kW, corresponding to 16 amps per phase, must receive approval from DNOs. This red tape can encourage installers to limit system capacity below the threshold, though one operator has raised the threshold to 5kW, encouraging larger residential installations. Those under 14.72kW are now subject to a fast-track process, with responses due within ten working days.

The roadmap also indicates that high-voltage overhead power lines over 2km long mounted on wooden poles will no longer be considered nationally significant infrastructure projects due to their low visual impact.

One of the most welcome aspects of the package concerns the treatment of battery energy storage systems (BESS), commonly co-located with solar farms. BESS are currently considered a hindrance to the electricity system, rather than providing the benefits of absorbing excess power and supplying it during periods of peak demand. New and harmonised modelling procedures will be introduced in response.

Reforming who pays for new high-voltage supergrid transformers, which the roadmap describes as a “postcode lottery”, is also expected.

Ground-mount solar

The roadmap endorses Solar Energy UK’s Community Engagement Good Practice Guidance [3]. Aside from supporting developers, operators and the supply chain, it is equally “useful to local authorities and communities as a referencing material for engaging with solar industry developers and operators”, says the paper.

The association has also committed to developing a template for developers to use for stakeholder mapping and a communications toolkit for conveying the benefits of solar power when engaging with local communities.

In parallel, the provision of community benefits has a vital role to play, and it is the subject of an ongoing DESNZ consultation [4]. While the Government’s position is being considered, Solar Energy UK will publish a voluntary protocol and guidance for community benefits later this year, covering installations over 5MW (other than rooftop, ‘behind the meter’, community-owned or community-led solar farms).

Scotland is consulting on refreshing its principles for community benefits, while the Welsh Government has already issued guidance [5, 6].

Supply chain

The roadmap represents a “once-in-a-generation opportunity to grow the solar supply chain and manufacturing capacity in the UK”. While economics exclude the manufacturing of conventional silicon-based panels, there is scope to grow the production of transformers, inverters, switchgear, supporting bracketry and cabling, it says, not to mention batteries and R&D, particularly for lightweight and cutting-edge perovskite PV technology.

Accordingly, the government will consider supporting companies looking to scale up production of innovative solar technologies, processes and associated equipment, alongside the development of standards and testing facilities for next-generation solar technologies.

The roadmap also details the government’s support for the “world-leading” Solar Stewardship Initiative, intended to prevent the procurement of solar panels produced with raw materials coming from forced labour. This comes after confirming that the system will be used by Great British Energy.

“The UK Government is clear that there should be no procurement of solar panels where there is evidence of forced labour. Government will empower contracting authorities to exclude suppliers from government contracts who have committed labour market misconduct and/or environmental offences in the UK or overseas… The UK solar sector has been proactive in its response to this issue,” says the roadmap, noting Solar Energy UK’s Supply Chain Statement and Responsible Sourcing FAQ [7, 8].

Skills development

The rapid growth of the UK solar industry, expected to expand by up to 17% this year, “offers a generational opportunity to create a wealth of high-quality jobs. At this crucial juncture, we must put the structures in place to build the skilled workforce needed now and in the decades to come,” the roadmap says.

Without action, there is a risk of skilled labour shortages, skills gaps, loss of key skills “and potentially costly, urgent intervention further into the future,” it warns.

Solving the problem will require intervention from across government, including the National Wealth Fund, GB Energy, Skills England, the Office for Clean Energy Jobs and the devolved administrations. Solar Energy UK has also stepped up, with the formation of the Solar Careers UK initiative, which will provide information and guidance on what skills and competences are needed for jobs in the sector and how to attain them. It has already held its first careers fair and is continuing to expand engagement.

The roadmap itself offers no fewer than 11 actions on skills, including improving the provision and effectiveness of training, mapping the routes to competence for core occupations and connecting colleges and businesses. Solar Energy UK will work with other trade bodies on how to attract and retain newly trained installers and prepare teaching materials for schools.

Planning

In the case of development planning, much of the action needed to help the sector has already been undertaken or is underway. This includes raising the threshold for solar farms to be considered ‘nationally significant infrastructure projects’ from 50MW to 100MW, in force from the end of the year, and the recruitment and training of new planning officers.

The Planning and Infrastructure Bill currently proceeding through parliament will simplify the consenting process for major infrastructure projects and require national policy statements to be reviewed every five years. The environmental impact assessment system is also being streamlined, and the first Spatial Energy Plan and Land Use Framework are being developed.

The National Planning Policy Framework has been reformed to give greater weight to the benefits of renewable energy and proposals’ contributions to meeting net zero, and a consultation on the National Policy Statement for Renewable Energy was held recently [9].

But there is still more to do. Solar Energy UK has committed to working with the planning profession to ensure that training is fit for purpose. It will also produce factsheets to advise planners and councillors, plugging the gap in the expertise needed to assess solar applications effectively. We also intend to engage with any regional mayor or combined authority interested in driving forward solar developments in their area.

There is also work to do in relation to floating solar, which has significant potential but currently faces higher costs than deployment on the ground. Reforms to support the nascent sector will be considered under the planning regime and potentially via the Contracts for Difference system.

Solar Energy UK would like to extend our sincere thanks for the work of the former co-chairs of the taskforce, Andrew Bowie MP and Graham Stuart MP, alongside the members of its five sub-groups on networks, skills, supply chain and innovation, rooftop solar and communications. We are also grateful to former MP Chris Skidmore, who suggested the taskforce’s formation in his 2023 Review of Net Zero.

In practice, making it harder to expand clean energy will undermine Trump’s push to expand U.S. manufacturing.","President Donald Trump’s “one big, beautiful bill” will limit the development of solar and wind power at a time when they offer the fastest and cheapest ways to meet a rising demand for electricity.

The new law phases out tax credits and other incentives for producing and using renewable energy that were adopted under former President Joe Biden.

The timing is particularly bad for North Carolina, where growth in population and manufacturing are increasing the demand for energy.

While Trump is stifling clean energy, there are also setbacks at the state level. The legislature has dropped interim targets for sharply reducing utilities’ carbon emissions by 2050, and the state’s largest utility, Duke Energy, has put off plans to tap the state’s bountiful offshore wind resource.

To check on how these developments are affecting clean energy in North Carolina, I spoke with Steve Kalland, executive director of the North Carolina Clean Energy Technology Center at N.C. State University. He had just finished attending last week’s renewable energy trade show in Las Vegas, which drew more than 40,000 participants and 1,300 exhibitors.

The clean energy industry is thriving nationally, though it will be slowed once tax breaks and other incentives expire in 2026, Kalland said.

In practice, making it harder to expand clean energy will undermine Trump’s push to expand U.S. manufacturing. It will actually limit the ability to quickly increase the electricity supply, drive up energy costs and slow the emergence of industries built around renewable energy, a growing part of the North Carolina economy.

“In general, it does seem counterintuitive that the attacks on clean energy — which are clearly and demonstrably the lowest-cost options right now — just seem to run directly in the face of the goals of the administration, which is to cut energy costs and make America energy dominant,” he said.

Utilities say they can meet increasing electricity demand with new natural gas-powered plants and smaller-scale nuclear units, but Kalland said bringing those power sources online can take five years or more while the demand is rising now and expanding clean energy can happen quickly.

“So the expectation is that either we are going to build solar and wind over the next five to seven years nationally and in North Carolina in order to meet increasing demand, or we are not going to meet increasing demand, which is going to be a problem,” he said.

As demand presses the energy supply, prices are rising, he said.

“We’re seeing energy prices climb faster than the rate of inflation. In some places maybe as much as twice the rate of inflation,” he said. “That’s not a good sign for anything because energy touches every single part of the economy.”

Kalland is worried by legislation passed this year that removed the 2030 carbon emissions reduction target for North Carolina utilities, though the goal of achieving net zero emissions — an even balance between emissions released and emissions reduced — by 2050 remains.

“If people are not working steadily toward that 2050 goal, it creates an opportunity for folks to not be making the steady progress that’s necessary because they think some new technology will come in,” he said. “Because of that, we could easily wind up at 2045 with a fairly sizable distance to go.”

Not committing to offshore wind power is also a setback, he said. “The offshore wind thing may be the biggest loss for North Carolina’s economy because we really had just started to capture it. It was really coming,” he said.

Disruptions in the advancement of clean energy are hardly new. Kalland has witnessed the ups and downs since began working with solar power in 1993. “We affectionately call it ‘the solar coaster,’ “ he said.

Kalland said the clean energy industry will rebound from the loss of incentives.

“I think that there is hope that once everybody lets the dust settle from what’s going on with the ‘big’ – it’s hard for me to call it the ‘beautiful bill’ – once that dust settles I think the industry will evaluate where things stand, get out their spreadsheets and come up with a new way of doing things. It will be slower but it will continue to go forward.”",https://www.mcclatchy-wires.com/public/incoming/y0rp63/picture312047442/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/fd91329d-5cee-4c7b-9f34-36ed321a5fbd,N,,2025-09-15 09:59:49.926655

By Eric Brophy and Patrick O’Reilly

When New Jersey celebrates “Made in New Jersey” Manufacturing Day on October 3, 2025, industry leaders will have no shortage of topics to discuss. Chief among them is Governor Phil Murphy’s recent signing of the Next NJ Manufacturing Program (A5687/S4407) into law on August 13. The initiative, housed within the New Jersey Economic Development Authority (NJEDA), is designed to sharpen the state’s competitive edge by driving new investment, capital expansion, and job creation across the manufacturing sector.

The program allocates $500 million in targeted tax credits exclusively for qualifying manufacturing businesses, with a dedicated $100 million carve-out for clean energy manufacturing. By reserving a significant portion of funds for firms building renewable and sustainable products, Trenton is signaling that advanced and green manufacturing are central to the state’s long-term growth strategy.

In addition, the program allows for certain qualified businesses, such as Minority and Women Business Enterprises, located in Opportunity Zones or those businesses with collective bargaining agreements or labor harmony agreements to receive bonus credit awards. This program is just the latest of many incentives programs the NJEDA has rolled out to spur economic development and job creation as part of Governor Murphy’s dedication to creating an innovation economy.

A Broad Incentive Strategy

The manufacturing initiative builds on a framework of business support programs that have been introduced or expanded during Governor Murphy’s term. The Emerge Program provides tax credits tied directly to job creation and capital investment, rewarding companies that commit to staying and growing in New Jersey. The Aspire Program supports real estate and redevelopment projects, helping attract commercial tenants while breathing new life into New Jersey’s urban centers.

Fueling Innovation and Startups

Governor Murphy has consistently tied economic development to innovation. For example, the New Jersey Innovation Evergreen Fund (NJIEF) is a flagship program that combines public and private capital to fund promising startups. By auctioning state tax credits to established companies and reinvesting those proceeds in young firms, NJEDA is fostering both capital flow and corporate mentorship for emerging entrepreneurs.

Complementing this is the long-standing Net Operating Loss (NOL) Program, which allows early-stage tech and life sciences companies to sell operating losses for immediate cash. Expanded in recent years, it now makes New Jersey one of the most attractive states for research-driven startups.

Targeting Strategic Industries

The state has also invested heavily in clean energy, film, and advanced manufacturing. The Film and Digital Media Tax Credit Program has lured major productions to the state, creating jobs and boosting local economies. In 2023, the state saw nearly $600 million in qualified film spend. And, in 2025, “Happy Gilmore 2” spent over $152 million on just one film.

Balancing Costs with Opportunity

New Jersey is an expensive state to start and build a business. But officials are betting that targeted, imaginative, tax credits and incentives will offset those costs and attract new companies while at the same time keeping others rooted in the Garden State. The Next NJ Manufacturing Program underscores that strategy: making long-term investment in New Jersey more attractive, while reinforcing the state’s position as a center for innovation, clean energy, and advanced manufacturing.

Voters are especially concerned about rising insurance rates, and many also expect climate change to impact everyday costs like utilities and groceries.
Against this backdrop, voters overwhelmingly support requiring oil and gas companies to pay their share of climate damages, including through a climate superfund law, and are more likely to support candidates who back those measures.
Under the cost-sharing frame, 77% of voters express support, including 89% of Democrats, 78% of Independents, and 64% of Republicans.
Voters also say that support for a climate superfund bill could influence their choices at the ballot box.","This year has brought record-breaking heat domes across the central and eastern U.S., catastrophic flash floods in Texas that swept away homes and RVs, and devastated a summer camp community, and destructive wildfires in Southern California that leveled thousands of homes. These disasters are becoming more frequent and are driving up costs that average people are forced to bear. As families across the U.S. shoulder this financial burden, states like New York and Vermont have passed “climate superfund” laws, and several others have introduced similar proposals — measures that require polluting industries to pay for a share of climate damages caused by their emissions. Now, these laws face opposition from the federal government, which is moving to strike them down or otherwise shield polluters from legal accountability. Despite these developments, polls consistently show voters overwhelmingly support efforts to hold polluters accountable for mounting climate damages.

In a new poll of national likely voters, Data for Progress and Fossil Free Media find that nearly half of respondents say they or someone they know has personally experienced extreme heat waves in the past five years, and most believe these events are becoming more frequent. Voters are especially concerned about rising insurance rates, and many also expect climate change to impact everyday costs like utilities and groceries.

Against this backdrop, voters overwhelmingly support requiring oil and gas companies to pay their share of climate damages, including through a climate superfund law, and are more likely to support candidates who back those measures. These views are consistent with earlier polling and, in several cases, reflect increased levels of concern and support over time. This support is broad across demographics and partisan lines, including with majorities of Republicans who back polluter accountability, suggesting that public appetite for such action is durable and growing.

When asked about extreme weather, nearly half of voters (45%) report that they or someone they know personally has experienced extreme heat waves in the last five years, while about 3 in 10 say the same about flooding or flash flooding. In states that were oversampled for this survey, the toll is especially stark: About half of North Carolina and Texas voters report experience with flooding, nearly 4 in 5 Floridians and 3 in 5 North Carolinians say the same about hurricanes or tropical storms, and in every state, at least 2 in 5 voters report that they or someone they know has experienced extreme heat waves.

Looking more broadly, a majority of voters believe both climate change (56%) and fossil fuel pollution (52%) will directly affect their household finances, views consistent with an earlier poll from this year. Views follow clear partisan patterns: More than two-thirds of Democrats and just over half of Independents expect financial impacts, while a majority of Republicans say these factors will have little to no effect.

State results mirror these partisan divides. In bluer states like Illinois and Virginia, voters are far more likely to expect financial impact; two-thirds in Illinois (66%) and nearly 3 in 5 in Virginia (59%) say climate change will affect their household finances. In more conservative states such as Texas, Florida, and North Carolina, voters are more split, with about an equal share saying climate change will have an impact on their finances as those who say it will have little or no impact. The same pattern holds for fossil fuel pollution: Majorities in Illinois and Virginia expect financial effects, while respondents are generally split in the more Republican-leaning states.

Among voters who do expect financial effects, large majorities point to higher utility bills (73%), grocery bills (68%), and gas prices (65%). Many also anticipate increases in health care costs, housing costs, and property maintenance expenses.

This broad consensus translates directly into support for legislative action. In an A/B split sample, voters were asked about a proposed “climate superfund” bill in two different ways: One framing emphasized requiring oil and gas companies to pay a share of the cost of damages caused by their pollution (Split A), while the other emphasized requiring them to pay into a fund that would help communities recover from climate disasters (Split B).

In both cases, support is overwhelming. Under the cost-sharing frame, 77% of voters express support, including 89% of Democrats, 78% of Independents, and 64% of Republicans. Under the recovery fund frame, support remains nearly identical at 78% overall, and 89%, 80%, and 66% among Democrats, Independents, and Republicans, respectively.

State-level results reinforce the breadth of this support. In both Illinois and North Carolina, 78% of voters back the recovery fund framing, while support in Florida (75%), Texas (73%), and Virginia (79%) is also strong. Under the cost-sharing framing, support is highest in Florida (80%) and Texas (78%), with majorities in all oversampled states backing the measure.

Across both split sample groups, there is a marked increase in climate superfund support when compared with polling from 2024, when 66% of voters said they would support a ""climate superfund"" bill that would require oil and gas companies to pay a share of the cost of climate damages caused by their pollution.

Voters also say that support for a climate superfund bill could influence their choices at the ballot box. Sixty-one percent report they would be more likely to support a candidate who backed such a measure, compared with just 16% who say they would be less likely. This includes nearly 4 in 5 Democrats (78%), about 3 in 5 Independents (59%), and nearly half of Republicans (47%).

State-level results are consistent: In each of the oversampled states, large majorities say they would be more likely to support a candidate who favored a climate superfund bill.

Compared with April 2024, when 50% of voters said they would be more likely to support a candidate who backed a superfund bill and 22% said they would be less likely, the latest results point to a clear increase in support. Because the earlier poll included a “don’t know” option, some of that change reflects differences in question design, but the overall movement still indicates real growth in support for candidates who support these efforts.

Together, these results show that supporting polluter accountability carries broad electoral appeal, with significant support even among Republican voters typically seen as more aligned with the oil and gas industry.",http://static1.squarespace.com/static/5aa9be92f8370a24714de593/t/68c48193ca6e662c7fdb2c2f/1757708691445/Poll+LA+Strong+Majority+of+Voters+Believe+Congress+Shouldn%E2%80%99t+Fund+AI+Innovation+Until+It+Passes+AI+Consumer+Protection+Laws+%2873%29.png?format=1500w,N,,2025-09-15 12:07:55.137960

Under the deal, both countries will be able to fast-track reactor design checks, meaning if a reactor has already passed rigorous safety checks in one country, this work can be used by the other to support its assessment, avoiding duplicating work.

It is also expected to unlock billions in private investment, accelerating the development of clean energy projects and boosting the UK’s position as a global leader in nuclear energy.

Major deals include an £11 billion small modular reactor (SMR) at the former Cottam coal-fired power station in Nottinghamshire, 12 advanced reactors in Hartlepool, and micro-reactors for London Gateway port’s £1 billion expansion.

These projects promise to boost energy security, create jobs – including 2,500 in Nottinghamshire – and stimulate regional growth.

Those announced so far feature partnerships between Holtec, EDF and Tritax, X-Energy and Centrica, Last Energy and DP World, Urenco and Radiant, and TerraPower and KBR.

Simon Bowen, chairman at Great British Energy – Nuclear said: “The UK-US commitment to nuclear energy sends a clear signal – this is a pivotal moment for energy security and clean growth.

“There is enormous potential to unlock investment in the UK’s nuclear sector – supporting high-quality jobs, regional growth, and the development of a resilient, capable supply chain.”

According to the Nuclear Industry Association, the sector has already seen 11,000 new jobs created this year following government-led investment.

powering clean technologies—rare earths, aluminum, and copper—are becoming scarcer as demand surges. Primary extraction is no longer sufficient to meet global decarbonization goals, nor is it sustainable. Recycling, once a niche activity, is now a strategic imperative. By 2025, the race to close the rare earths scrap gap has intensified, with recycling pioneers emerging as linchpins of supply chain resilience and environmental stewardship. For investors, this shift represents a unique opportunity to capitalize on an undervalued asset class at the intersection of sustainability, geopolitics, and technological innovation.

The Market Dynamics of Secondary Metal Supply Chains

The urgency to scale recycling is driven by three forces: sustainability mandates, supply chain security, and technological breakthroughs. According to a report by the World Economic Forum, global demand for rare earths is projected to grow by over 1,000% by 2050, driven by electric vehicles (EVs), wind turbines, and grid infrastructureThese are the top five energy technology trends of 2025[ 2 ]. However, primary mining remains concentrated in China, which controls 60% of global rare earth processing capacityThese are the top five energy technology trends of 2025[ 2 ]. This concentration has spurred a strategic pivot toward recycling, particularly in countries like India and the U.S., where policy incentives and domestic manufacturing mandates are reshaping the landscape.

China's dominance in the sector is not just a function of scale but of policy. The country has invested heavily in urban mining—extracting metals from discarded electronics, batteries, and industrial waste—while imposing stricter export controls on raw materialsThese are the top five energy technology trends of 2025[ 2 ]. Meanwhile, India's early achievement of its 2030 renewable energy targets has created a surge in decommissioned solar panels and wind turbines, fueling a nascent but rapidly growing recycling industryThese are the top five energy technology trends of 2025[ 2 ]. These developments underscore a broader trend: recycling is no longer a supplement to primary supply but a core component of national energy strategies.

Technological Innovations and Policy Catalysts

Advancements in recycling technologies are closing the efficiency gap between primary and secondary production. For example, hydrometallurgical processes now enable the recovery of over 95% of rare earths from neodymium magnets in EV motorsThese are the top five energy technology trends of 2025[ 2 ]. Similarly, innovations in aluminum and copper recycling have reduced energy consumption by 90% compared to smelting, aligning with corporate net-zero commitmentsThese are the top five energy technology trends of 2025[ 2 ]. These technologies are being scaled by startups and traditional recyclers alike, creating a fragmented but dynamic market ripe for consolidation.

Policy shifts are amplifying this momentum. The U.S.-China trade dispute in 2025, for instance, highlighted the strategic value of copper and rare earths, prompting both nations to partially roll back tariffs on key commoditiesTracking tariffs: Key moments in the US-China trade dispute[ 3 ]. In the U.S., the Inflation Reduction Act's tax credits for recycled materials have incentivized automakers and grid operators to prioritize secondary supply chainsThese are the top five energy technology trends of 2025[ 2 ]. The European Union's Circular Economy Action Plan, meanwhile, mandates a 70% recycling rate for critical raw materials by 2030These are the top five energy technology trends of 2025[ 2 ]. These regulatory tailwinds are creating a “policy premium” for companies that can demonstrate circularity in their operations.

The Investment Thesis: A Gold Rush for Circular Assets

The convergence of these factors positions recycling as a high-conviction investment theme. Unlike traditional commodities, secondary metal supply chains offer dual value propositions: environmental impact and geopolitical diversification. For example, a company specializing in rare earth recovery from electronic waste not only mitigates supply risks but also aligns with ESG benchmarks, attracting capital from institutional investors and green bonds.

Emerging business models further enhance the sector's appeal. “Urban mining” platforms, which aggregate scrap from consumers and industries, are leveraging AI and blockchain to optimize collection and traceabilityThese are the top five energy technology trends of 2025[ 2 ]. Partnerships between recyclers and original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) are also gaining traction, with

and Siemens now sourcing 30% of their copper and rare earths from recycled streamsThese are the top five energy technology trends of 2025[ 2 ]. These collaborations create sticky, long-term revenue streams and reduce exposure to volatile primary markets.

Risks and the Path Forward

While the sector's potential is clear, risks remain. Recycling technologies are capital-intensive, and scaling them requires upfront investment. Regulatory uncertainty—such as fluctuating tariffs or inconsistent global standards—could also disrupt margins. However, these challenges are surmountable. Investors with a long-term horizon can mitigate risk by targeting companies with proprietary technologies, strong policy alignment, and diversified feedstock sources.",https://lh-prod-oper-pub-opercenter.s3.amazonaws.com/discovery-image/compress-19bd2643784bc002.png,N,,2025-09-15 16:01:17.510183

“Clean hydrogen is poised for significant growth in the years ahead,” Raffi Garabedian, Electric Hydrogen’s CEO, said in a statement.
“If you don’t have demand for hydrogen, you won’t have demand for electrolyzers,” Tengler said.
“If you don’t have demand for hydrogen, you won’t have demand for electrolyzers,” Tengler said.
“The idea of this deal is that it helps them become a developer of hydrogen projects, and they’ll be the ones buying their own electrolyzers.","Last week, electrolyzer manufacturer Electric Hydrogen bought the hydrogen developer Ambient Fuels. The deal was backed by $400 million from the investor Generate Capital to finance projects all over the world that use the zero-carbon version of the fuel.

It’s part of what analysts say is a forthcoming wave of consolidation as an industry that expanded quickly grapples with limited near-term demand for its fuel.

“You’ve got way too much potential supply out there,” Martin Tengler, the head of hydrogen research at the consultancy BloombergNEF, told Latitude Media. “We count more than 100 manufacturers and not enough demand for the electrolyzers they produce. That naturally leads to attrition.”

In some cases, that means mergers. In July, for example, oil and gas giant Baker Hughes bought hydrogen heavyweight Chart Industries. In others, it means going bust. In May, the French hydrogen stripe McPhy collapsed into insolvency, with a court overseeing the sale of its parts.

If all the green and blue hydrogen projects announced worldwide came to fruition, the industry would generate 200 million metric tons of fuel from renewably-powered electrolyzers and carbon capture-equipped gas per year, Tengler said. That’s double the global supply of gray hydrogen, the version of the fuel made with unmitigated gas.

Yet only 6% of those green and blue hydrogen projects have identified offtakers to buy the fuel, which is far more expensive than the dirty alternative. Of that 6%, just 13% have binding offtake agreements.

“So, less than 1% of this 200 million tons have secured a binding agreement where the buyer must buy,” Tengler said. “If you don’t have that kind of offtake agreement, it’s going to be hard to find a banker to finance the project.”

Electric Hydrogen appears to be betting it can capture more of the market by vertically integrating its equipment with the projects deploying it.

“Clean hydrogen is poised for significant growth in the years ahead,” Raffi Garabedian, Electric Hydrogen’s CEO, said in a statement. “We believe this new integration will both enable the industry to scale faster and give Electric Hydrogen even more ways to serve our diverse array of customers — from those who want to do it all themselves, from power procurement all the way to the finished clean-fuel — to those who prefer a partner to finance and develop the hydrogen plant so they can remain focused on their business outcomes.”

In other words: Electric Hydrogen wants to seize as much of the demand in the market as possible. It’s an extension of the company’s enduring tactic of scaling up manufacturing even through a downturn, as Garabedian explained on a March episode of the Green Blueprint podcast.

For more on Electric Hydrogen’s strategy, listen to Raffi Garabedian on the Green Blueprint:

But until now, Electric Hydrogen’s approach has solely been to build large-scale, 100-megawatt electrolyzer plants for industrial projects; the company has never itself been a hydrogen producer. With the Ambient acquisition, Electric Hydrogen is expanding its potential customer base to include hydrogen end users — as well as the ammonia plants or SAF facilities that have already been buying the company’s electrolyzers to make hydrogen of their own.

“If you don’t have demand for hydrogen, you won’t have demand for electrolyzers,” Tengler said. “The idea of this deal is that it helps them become a developer of hydrogen projects, and they’ll be the ones buying their own electrolyzers. If they can find a buyer for the hydrogen, then that seems like an interesting move.”

The shifting policy landscape

The acquisition comes as the hydrogen industry leans into something it hasn’t had for years: relative policy certainty.

The 45V tax credit enacted as part of the Inflation Reduction Act was just the start of a regulatory rollercoaster. The months that followed the law’s passage in 2022 brought fierce debate over how the Treasury Department should define eligibility for the credit — and by extension what kind of hydrogen could be considered “clean.” The fairly strict initial proposal included three pillars — additionality, deliverability, and hourly matching — and prompted intense pushback from certain segments of the industry.

Ambient, for instance, planned to build a major project in Texas “smack dab in the middle” of six refineries currently running on gray hydrogen, and there wasn’t enough physical space to add new batteries big enough to deploy solar panels and wind turbines and allow those refineries to run 24/7 — as the draft guidance would have required for eligibility for 45V credits.

“We wanted to be the billboard for the next generation of carbon-free hydrogen, right in the middle of all that heavy industry, all that refining,” Ambient CEO Jacob Susman told Latitude Media last year. “In making that choice, we put ourselves at risk. If you were required to have this hourly matching, it might make more sense to be sitting right next to the solar plant or the wind farm.”

The debate over the Treasury guidance persisted well into last year. The industry finally got clarity on how the tax credits would work in December 2024, mere weeks before the Trump administration took office. The final rule added some flexibility, providing carve-outs for nuclear plants that would have been excluded under the additionality requirement, and for projects in states with high amounts of renewables.

When President Donald Trump took office pledging to rescind much of the IRA, the fate of the policy was once again thrust into uncertainty. But lobbying by powerful Trump allies, including some representatives of the oil and gas industry, helped preserve the tax credit in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act that largely replaced the IRA. The turnaround helped ensure that certain projects would pencil out beyond a single year.

This was roughly what Susman predicted last fall, telling Latitude Media: “We don’t think they’re coming for hydrogen first.”

If the industry can manage to find enough buyers for green hydrogen now, Tengler said, a tie-up between Ambient’s projects and Electric Hydrogen’s electrolyzers may help produce a giant in the space that can compete with the Chinese manufacturers currently dominating the market.

“If you don’t have demand for hydrogen, you won’t have demand for electrolyzers,” Tengler said. “The idea of this deal is that it helps them become a developer of hydrogen projects, and they’ll be the ones buying their own electrolyzers. If they can find a buyer for the hydrogen, then that seems like an interesting move.”",https://i0.wp.com/www.latitudemedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Latitude-1920px-32-Image-2025-09-12T182829.060.jpg?fit=1920%2C1280&ssl=1,N,,2025-09-15 11:03:41.132995

Australia’s roughly 11 million households have the world’s highest level of solar installations, helping to drive the nation’s transition away from its aging fleet of coal-fired power generators. The government is eager to tap that enthusiasm as it seeks to meet an ambitious target to more than double renewable generation by 2030, and in July launched a program to cut upfront costs of home batteries.

Residential battery sales almost tripled in the first half of 2025 from a year earlier in the lead up to the program, the CEFC said. Meanwhile, about 1.1 gigawatts of rooftop solar was installed, surpassing the 1 gigawatt of commissioned large-scale renewable energy projects.

A weak grid, limited interconnector capacity between states and the slow rollout of key transmission projects pose big risks for new large renewable energy developments, according to BloombergNEF, which forecasts Australia won’t meet its goal for renewables to supply 82% of electricity until 2036. Many flagship emissions-reduction projects — including green hydrogen and offshore wind — have faced setbacks.
