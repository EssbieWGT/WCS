KHNP, Doosan, and additional Korean industrial partners have agreed to support Amazon and X-energy’s plans to deploy more than five gigawatts of new nuclear energy across the United States by 2039, while also exploring global regions.

The parties aim to mobilize up to $50 billion in public and private investments for Xe-100 projects and the expansion of associated supply chain capacity to support the future of American energy dominance and artificial intelligence growth.

X-energy Reactor Company, LLC (“X-energy”), Amazon, Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power Corporation (“KHNP”), and Doosan Enerbility today announced a strategic partnership to accelerate the deployment of Xe-100 fourth generation advanced small modular reactors (SMRs) and TRISO-X fuel in the United States to meet growing power demands from data centers and artificial intelligence (“AI”).

This partnership combines the world’s leading innovators in nuclear technology, energy project delivery, and cloud infrastructure to collaborate on the development and cost-effective deployment of X-energy’s advanced fourth generation reactor, delivering on the Trump administration’s goal to deploy advanced nuclear reactor technologies.

The agreement outlines collaboration across reactor engineering design, supply chain development, construction planning, investment strategies, long-term operations, and global opportunities for joint AI-nuclear deployment. Aligned with the recent $350 billion trade deal between the United States and the Republic of Korea, the companies also aim to mobilize up to $50 billion in public and private investment to support the future of nuclear energy in the U.S.

“This partnership brings together proven nuclear leadership and experience from Korean industry and X-energy’s advanced reactor and fuel technology to meet a historic energy challenge,” said X-energy CEO J. Clay Sell. “By combining our expertise, we are ensuring that we are best positioned to accelerate the Xe-100 SMR into the marketplace with the unique knowledge and skills developed throughout the South Korea industrial supply chain. Collaboration between the United States and South Korea in this critical sector is vital to preserving American leadership in the AI race and surpassing China as the leader in nuclear development.”

KHNP president and CEO Dr. Joo-ho Whang added, “As more countries seek to introduce SMRs in response to the climate crisis and to strengthen energy security, global competition for SMR development is becoming increasingly fierce. By strengthening cooperation with the United States, I expect that the technological and business capabilities of both countries will generate strong synergies in the global SMR market. This partnership positions us to meet the needs of a 21st century economy with the safest, most secure, and most proliferation-resistant fuel and reactor technology today.”

“Data centers are the critical infrastructure needed to support AI leadership, and their power needs continue to accelerate to meet the growing needs of our customers,” stated Amazon Web Services (“AWS”) Head of Worldwide Energy, Vibhu Kaushik. “By forming this partnership with KHNP and Doosan along with X-energy, we’re continuing to pursue innovative carbon-free solutions and technology to help meet the increasing energy demand, and we’re excited that this will help us enable over five gigawatts of new nuclear energy in the U.S.”

Chairman Park Ji-won of Doosan Enerbility remarked, “We are honored to seize this opportunity to accelerate the commercialization of Xe-100 technology, made possible through the support and interest of both governments."" He further stated, ""Doosan will faithfully fulfill its role, leveraging its proven manufacturing expertise, to ensure that this MOU becomes a model example of bilateral cooperation in the energy industry.

The agreement builds on X-energy’s existing relationships with strategic Korean partners, including DL E&C, a leading engineering and construction services company with whom X-energy has partnered since 2023. X-energy and Amazon are seeking to build a world-leading ecosystem of partners that will support delivery of X-energy reactors to its customers. In line with this, Doosan has agreed to secure the manufacturing capabilities required for the successful deployment of Xe-100 modules.

X-energy is advancing its initial Xe-100 deployment with Dow Inc. at its UCC Seadrift Operations manufacturing site as part of the U.S. Department of Energy’s Advanced Research Demonstration Program established under the first Trump administration. In May 2025, the proposed four-reactor project reached a critical milestone with its Construction Permit Application accepted for an 18-month review by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission. X-energy is also advancing its second Xe-100 deployment with Energy Northwest in Washington state in collaboration with Amazon. The Energy Northwest site is expected to initially host four Xe-100 reactors with plans to expand to 12.

In fact, analysts predict that America's EV demand could drop as much as 27% without the credit in place.","The IRS is giving some wiggle room to buyers who don't take delivery of their new EV by the federal tax credit's expiration date of September 30.

As long as a buyer signs a binding contract and puts down a deposit by September 30, the U.S. government will recognize the sale and allow for the tax credit to be applied.

Ultimately, this will benefit buyers who already know what they're buying and just can't get it in time.

Electric vehicle shoppers are sweating the federal EV tax credit's fast-approaching expiration date of September 30. Those who have been shopping around for an upgrade or simply don't want to miss out on the U.S. government's rebate program have been moving up their buying timelines, sending EV sales soaring.

If you're one of those shoppers, here's one reason to breathe a sigh of relief: The IRS is cutting folks a break if they aren't quite able to take delivery by the deadline.

On Thursday, the IRS clarified how exactly several tax credit schemes terminated by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act will be phased out. The law changed the tax credits for new, used and commercial EVs—30D, 25E and 45W, respectively—to say that they don't apply for vehicles ""acquired"" after September 30. Now the IRS has cleared up what that actually means.

The guidance notes that buyers won't actually need to take delivery of their vehicle by September 30. But they will need to have a binding sales agreement signed by that deadline. And they'll need to make some kind of payment, which could be a down payment.

It's important to point out that this isn't some sort of magic fix that will save the EV tax credit, or even one that can guarantee it will be applied to a car that you've preordered (sorry, soon-to-be Rivian R2 buyers). But it does mean buyers can squeeze in a last-minute purchase of vehicles caught up in transit or just not able to be driven home by the end of September.

""For purposes of sections 25E, 30D, and 45W, a vehicle is 'acquired' as of the date a written binding contract is entered into and a payment has been made. A payment includes a nominal downpayment or a vehicle trade-in,"" the IRS said. Assuming a buyer checks those boxes, they can then claim the credit once their vehicle is ""placed in service,"" the IRS notes, even if that happens after September 30.

That wasn't clear before. After the OBBBA was signed into law on July 4, Tesla told customers they must ""take delivery (not just order)"" by September 30 to get the federally funded discount.

NPR sheds a bit of additional light onto the requirements set by the IRS:

The IRS has typically used delivery dates to determine eligibility for the tax credit; for example, if your vehicle would have qualified for a tax credit in 2024 but not in 2025, and you took delivery on January 1, you were out of luck.

But it's not unprecedented for the agency to base eligibility on the date a contract was signed.

""The IRS has used this exact same language before, when the rules for claiming the credit changed after the Inflation Reduction Act was passed,"" notes Sean Tucker, the lead editor of Kelley Blue Book.

Automakers are already dangling discounts and deals to the public to encourage them to buy ahead of the end of the federal EV tax credit. Buyers who scoop a vehicle up now will have the U.S. government subsidizing the cost of the vehicle. After September 30? It's up to the automaker to eat into its own margin to make the vehicle more affordable.

Most automakers won't be able to do that to the tune of $7,500 and still make a profit (especially on base trims). In fact, analysts predict that America's EV demand could drop as much as 27% without the credit in place.

This little bit of extra wiggle room is not a free ride for the industry, or even one that will solve the lull expected in Q4 sales. It's more of a caffeine shot that will give buyers the chance to qualify for the credit before the FOMO-driven Q3 sugar high comes crashing down.

This will mostly benefit folks who have a vehicle already picked out. If they're buying a Model 3, for example, this could benefit them if their delivery day gets pushed back by the service center. Or those who want another vehicle that their local dealership still has in transit from the factory, or needs to be sourced from another dealer's lot. And let's not forget those who choose to lease an EV.",https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/8AxV0q/s1/end-of-the-ev-tax-credit.jpg,N,,2025-08-25 17:02:37.128030

A petition seeking to bar utility companies and government contractors from making political donations is set to begin collecting signatures, with both the language summary and the form of the petition receiving approval from the Board of State Canvassers on Friday.

The final summary approved by the board reads:

“Initiation of legislation to: Prohibit regulated electric and gas utilities, contractors with over $250,000 annually in government contracts and people and organizations with substantial connections to these utilities/contractors from making direct or indirect campaign contributions to those who run for or hold offices that impact them; expand campaign finance laws and restrictions that regulate spending on political communications, including laws that require disclosing donor information to apply to communications clearly identifying candidates or ballot questions, even if they do not expressly advocate voting for/against them; expressly apply the law requiring disclosure of who paid for political communications to internet political communications.”

In order to move forward, the ballot campaign, Michiganders for Money Out of Politics, must collect 356,958 signatures within 180 days.

After receiving enough valid signatures, the Legislature can choose to adopt or reject the proposal within 40 days. If adopted, the proposal is not subject to the governor’s veto power. If rejected, the matter goes to the voters.

The Save on Better Appliances campaign is designed to help families take advantage of federal energy tax credits before they expire at the end of 2025, while also showing how modern electric appliances can cut long-term energy costs.

With utility bills climbing, the group is highlighting the benefits of heat pumps, heat pump water heaters, rooftop solar, and other upgrades that can keep homes comfortable while protecting against future price spikes. For many households, energy-efficient appliances are one of the few ways to bring bills under control – and that value remains even after federal incentives are gone.

Right now, homeowners can still access the federal Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit (25C) and Residential Clean Energy Credit (25D). On top of that, thousands of state, local, and utility-level incentives are available to help offset upfront costs.

Ari Matusiak, CEO of Rewiring America, pointed out that the IRA incentives were never meant to last forever:

Congress’s decision to repeal them prematurely means households should act fast. But the savings, comfort, and long-term value of these upgrades remain. For homeowners ready to act, we have the tools to help. And for those who need more time, we’re working to expand your options and ensure that these upgrades make financial sense whenever the moment is right.

What the campaign offers

The Save on Better Appliances campaign runs through October and includes:

A central hub where homeowners can learn about the expiring credits, check out state, local, and utility incentives, and connect with vetted contractors.

Weekly Zoom drop-in sessions with Certified Electric Coaches, starting September 3, to answer questions about home upgrades.

Contractor tools, including Rewiring America’s Contractor Finder, soon to be integrated with the BetterHVAC directory for more trusted installer options.

A new Single-Project Personal Electrification Planner to help homeowners map out common projects like heat pumps, energy audits, and electrical upgrades.

“I’ve been doing HVAC installations for the past 40 years, and I can tell you that I’ve seen firsthand how the 25C tax credit has made heat pumps, the most efficient HVAC technology, more affordable and accessible for homeowners,” said Scotty Libby, owner of Maine-based Royal River Heat Pumps. “Homeowners should talk to their local contractors now if they want to upgrade their HVAC, take advantage of the tax credit, and lock in the potential long-term energy savings a heat pump would provide.”

Beyond tax credits

Rewiring America is also working with manufacturers, contractors, and lenders to make upgrades more affordable, even without federal help. In Rhode Island and Colorado, families can already access specially priced heat pump packages, with more states on the way. These deals will expand in 2026 and beyond, lowering upfront costs no matter what happens in Washington.

Across the country, state agencies, utilities, and local nonprofits are already leading creative programs to help families save money, find trusted contractors, and begin electrifying their homes. Rewiring America says this campaign is about amplifying that work and making it easier for households to take the first step.

“Tax credits may expire, but the benefits of better HVAC – lower bills, healthier homes, and lasting comfort – are here to stay. That’s why we’re supporting Rewiring America’s campaign,” said Bill Spohn, Sr., president of the Better HVAC Alliance.

James Showalter, founder of EG4, is quoted in the release as saying the partnership is the exact kind of arrangement the company intended to put its Commerce factory to work. The factory is about a half-hour’s drive west from its headquarters in Sulphur Springs, Texas.

“We believe in energy autonomy for our customers just as much as we believe in manufacturing autonomy for American innovators, and this partnership with Tigo allows us to make significant progress on both of those fronts,” Showalter is quoted as saying.

Zvi Alon, chairman and CEO at Tigo Energy, is quoted in the same release as saying the partnership marks a meeting of technological minds between the company. Tigo recently relocated from Campbell, Calif., to Los Gatos, Calif., both in the Southwest reaches of the San Jose metropolitan area.

“Tigo and EG4 are in alignment on some of the most critical success factors in solar, which include innovation and quality,” Alon is quoted as saying. “This makes for a strong foundation for success.”",https://pv-magazine-usa.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/Tigo.png,N,,2025-08-25 17:04:26.480138

“The EPA is proposing to bury its head in the sand and ignore the mounting cost of climate change for all Americans,” Mayes said.

Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser called the EPA’s proposal “misguided.”

“Ignoring common sense, including scientific research from our own government, is a recipe for disaster,” he said in a press release.

The EPA is challenging the underlying science used in the endangerment finding and said the rule has been used to justify more than $1 trillion in regulations. It has also said that the auto industry has suffered from “significant uncertainties” amid these emission regulations.

“Finally, EPA is proposing to provide much needed certainty and regulatory relief, so companies can plan appropriately, and the American people can have affordable choices when deciding to buy a car,” an agency press release stated.

This comes as the Trump administration rolls back policies promoting electric vehicles.

At the time of publication, the EPA had received more than 70,000 comments online regarding the plan. The agency had initially planned to host two full days of virtual public comments this week, but added two more to meet the demand.

The final rule is expected before the end of the year. Comments will be accepted online through Sept. 22.",https://891khol.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Web-template-795-x-447-px-10.png,N,,2025-08-25 17:03:32.771152

One of the biggest solar cell factories in the United States is under construction and set to produce solar cells by the end of 2026.

According to Electrek, T1 Energy plans to spend $850 million on its new project, the G2_Austin 5 GW Solar Cell Facility in Milam County, Texas.

The publication observed that there are significantly more solar module factories than solar cell factories in the U.S., so this will be a notable boost to the nation's solar industry.

Solar cells are the individual building blocks, made of semiconductor materials, that convert sunlight into energy. BR Solar Group explained, ""Multiple solar cells are wired together in a panel to provide a more substantial and useful power output.""

Solar cell technology is evolving, with companies trying to figure out how to make photovoltaics stretchable, transparent, and more cost-efficient.

Since solar cells make up solar panels, increasing solar cell production would make the U.S. solar supply chain more self-sufficient, meaning less reliance on expensive imports.

This solar cell plant will also create 1,800 new manufacturing jobs, according to Electrek.

One of the best ways to harness the sun's power and efficiency is to convert your home to a solar-powered one, which can reduce energy costs to near $0.

EnergySage can help homeowners compare quotes from local vetted solar panel installers for free to find the best option, potentially saving customers up to $10,000 on associated costs.

Once a home is solar-powered, homeowners can save money on running appliances, such as heat pumps. A heat pump can heat your home much more efficiently and cheaply than a gas-powered boiler, and it can also cool interiors while using less energy than an air conditioning unit. Mitsubishi can help interested customers find the right one for their needs.

With more solar cell manufacturing in the U.S., solar energy will become increasingly accessible.

T1's chairman of the board and CEO, Daniel Barcelo, said, per Electrek, ""Our facilities will manufacture solar cells and modules to invigorate our economy with abundant energy.""

First, on July 29, 2025, EPA issued a proposed rule entitled “Reconsideration of 2009 Endangerment Finding and Greenhouse Gas Vehicle Standards” (the Endangerment Finding Proposed Rule). The Endangerment Finding Proposed Rule would repeal all GHG emission standards for light-duty, medium-duty and heavy-duty vehicles that were promulgated under the Clean Air Act (CAA) Section 202(a) on the basis that the 2009 “Endangerment and Cause or Contribute Finding for Greenhouse Gases Under Section 202(a) of the Clean Air Act” (the Endangerment Finding exceeded EPA’s authority as established in CAA Section 202(a). It is anticipated to be argued that rescission of the Endangerment Finding would invalidate the legal basis for most existing EPA regulations aimed at reducing GHG emissions from vehicles and, as a result, call into question the legal basis that underlies similar rules for power plants and other emissions sources, thus altering the framework for existing regulation of GHG emissions and future promulgation and implementation of GHG emissions standards. As such, legal challenges are expected if the Endangerment Finding Proposed Rule is finalized.

Second and third, on June 17, 2025, EPA issued two proposed rules entitled “Repeal of Greenhouse Gas Emissions Standards for Fossil Fuel-Fired Electric Generating Units” (the GHG EGU Proposed Rule) and “National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants: Coal- and Oil-Fired Electric Utility Steam Generating Units” (the MATS Proposed Rule).

The GHG EGU Proposed Rule puts forward a primary proposal to reinterpret CAA Section 111(b) to require EPA to demonstrate that emissions from an existing source category “cause, or contribute significantly to” air pollution before it may regulate that pollutant and to establish a finding that GHG emissions from fossil-fuel fired electricity generating units (EGUs) do not contribute significantly to dangerous air pollution. EPA alternatively proposes to repeal a narrower set of requirements that includes emission guidelines for existing fossil fuel fired steam generating units, carbon capture and sequestration (CCS)-based standards for coal fired steam generating units undergoing large modifications and the CCS-based standards for new base load stationary combustion turbines. These proposed changes seek to first rescind all GHG limits on EGUs under the CAA or to substantially limit the regulatory obligations for EGUs under the CAA.

The MATS Proposed Rule, which is not discussed in greater detail below for brevity, seeks comment on the EPA’s proposal to repeal the following amendments made in 2024 to the rule: (i) the decrease in the filterable particulate matter emission standard for EGUs from 0.030 pounds/million British thermal units (MBtu) to 0.010 pounds/MBtu; (ii) limiting the compliance demonstration requirements for the fPM emission standards for coal- and oil-fired EGUs to only allowing the use of particulate matter continuous emission monitoring system(s); and (iii) the decrease in mercury emission standards for existing lignite-fired EGUs from 4.0 pounds/trillion British thermal units (TBtu) to 1.2 pounds/TBtu. If finalized, this proposed rule would repeal many of the 2024 amendments, bringing the MATS standards back to a similar place as they were in 2012.

This Alert will discuss the major elements of the Endangerment Finding Proposed Rule and the GHG EGU Proposed Rule, along with initial reactions from some environmental and industry groups and timelines for public comment.

Proposed Repeal of 2009 Endangerment Finding and Vehicle Emission Standards

Overview and History

On August 1, 2025, EPA published the Endangerment Finding Proposed Rule, which proposes to repeal the 2009 Endangerment Finding and remove all existing regulations that require new vehicles to comply with GHG emission standards. If finalized, this proposal would eliminate the current legal basis for EPA’s regulation of GHG emissions from the transportation sector. Similar legal bases underpin regulation of GHG emissions from other sources of air emissions (e.g., power plants, aircraft, and the oil and gas industry). As such, it is anticipated to be argued that rescission of the Endangerment Finding would call into question the legal bases underlying those regulations as well.

CAA Section 202(a)(1) directs EPA to establish standards for new vehicle emissions if the agency finds that the pollutant “causes, or contributes to, air pollution which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare.” In 2009, EPA issued an Endangerment Finding that a defined mix of six greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons and sulfur hexafluoride) in the atmosphere endangers public health and welfare, pursuant to the CAA Section 202(a). This Endangerment Finding was made in response to the Supreme Court’s decision in Massachusetts v. EPA, a 2007 case in which Massachusetts and several other states petitioned EPA to regulate carbon dioxide emissions and other gases that contribute to global warming from new motor vehicles. EPA had previously denied Massachusetts’ petition, claiming that the CAA did not authorize EPA to regulate GHG emissions. The Supreme Court sided with Massachusetts, holding that carbon dioxide fit the CAA’s broad definition of “air pollutant” and that EPA could not refuse to regulate GHGs on this basis and must provide a valid reason, based on the law, for not regulating them. EPA’s Endangerment Finding was promulgated after this decision and is the legal underpinning for EPA’s promulgation of tailpipe standards for light-, medium- and heavy-duty vehicles since 2010.

EPA’s Stated Primary Rationale for the Proposed Endangerment Finding Recission

In its Endangerment Finding Proposed Rule, based on its statutory analysis and review of the Endangerment Finding’s administrative and scientific record, EPA interprets CAA Section 202(a) to prohibit EPA’s jurisdiction over GHG emissions for vehicle standards based on global climate change concerns. In its Endangerment Finding Proposed Rule preamble, EPA states that the CAA Section 202(a) is best read to regulate air pollutant emissions that cause or contribute to air pollution that endangers public health or welfare through local or regional air pollution. By contrast, the 2009 Endangerment Finding asserts that GHGs lead to increases in global temperature that produce potentially adverse public health consequences. Citing the agency’s curtailed discretion after the Supreme Court’s decision in Loper Bright v. Raimondo, EPA concludes in the Endangerment Finding Proposed Rule that the Endangerment Finding determination is too attenuated to fit the definition of “air pollution” under the CAA. EPA has included its reasoning in the rule preamble to support the argument that regulation under Section 202(a) cannot be based solely on atmospheric concentrations without reference to local or regional effects. Further, EPA states that analyzing global climate change involves assessing causal relationships that are too uncertain to fit within the terms “cause” and “contribute” as used in CAA Section 202(a). As such, EPA proposes that emissions from a particular class of new vehicles must themselves cause or contribute to harmful air pollution. Additionally, EPA states that EPA’s position is not contrary to Massachusetts v. EPA, as EPA does not read that decision to require that the agency find that GHGs are subject to regulation under Section 202(a).

Further, EPA states in its Endangerment Finding Proposed Rule that the CAA Section 202(a) does not permit the procedural discretion asserted in the 2009 Endangerment Finding. Under the statutory language in Section 202(a) of the CAA, in order to regulate emissions, EPA must determine that emissions of a pollutant from a particular class of new vehicles (1) “cause, or contribute to” air pollution, and (2) that this pollution may endanger public health. The 2009 Endangerment Finding treated these two statutory elements as severable, finding that the six designated GHGs endangered public health without simultaneously determining that emissions from a specific class of vehicles contributed to that danger. In the Endangerment Finding Proposed Rule, EPA asserts that this approach was inconsistent with the text of the CAA. According to EPA, the CAA requires concurrent “endangerment” and “cause and contribute” findings that link emissions from specific vehicle categories to harmful air pollution. Lastly, EPA proposes that the Endangerment Finding implicates the “major questions doctrine,” a legal principle invoked by the Supreme Court in cases like West Virginia v. EPA, limits agencies from relying on vague statutory language to justify transformative regulatory actions. This case was discussed at length in our prior Alert. EPA contends that the CAA does not provide sufficient statutory support to justify the far-reaching impacts of the Endangerment Finding.

EPA’s Alternative Rationale for the Proposed Recission of the Endangerment Finding

As an alternative rationale or basis for its proposed rescission, EPA proposes that the Endangerment Finding should be rescinded because of uncertainty in the scientific record since 2009, as EPA stated that the Endangerment Finding relied on unduly pessimistic scientific research. As part of its review, EPA relied on a recent draft report submitted by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Climate Working Group to Secretary of Energy Christopher Wright on impacts of certain emissions on the climate, later published in the Federal Register. This document, for which DOE has requested public comment, asserts that scientific developments since 2009 cast doubt on the assumptions in the Endangerment Finding. Thus, EPA proposes that the scientific record is too speculative to reach an affirmative endangerment finding. Further, EPA proposes that the Endangerment Finding should not have analyzed the combined effect of the designated six GHGs. Rather, EPA states that the agency should have analyzed the properties and impacts of each GHG on an individual basis. EPA claims that this analytical flaw reduces the reliability of the Endangerment Finding and should result in its recission.

EPA’s Separate Bases for Proposed Repeal of Vehicle Emission Standards

As an additional alternative, EPA proposes to repeal all vehicle emissions standards on the basis that existing technology is not adequate to address global climate change without risking greater harm to human health and the environment. Section 202(a)(2) of the CAA directs the administrator to determine the “requisite technology” needed to meet emissions standards. In the Endangerment Finding Proposed Rule, EPA contends that even if the Endangerment Finding were to remain in effect, policy considerations can be taken into account when setting emissions standards and determining the “requisite technology."" When considering policy choices, including safety, consumer choice, economic opportunity and air quality, EPA asserts that there is no “requisite technology” adequate to address global climate change. EPA further states in its proposed rescission that reducing GHG emissions from vehicles does not have a measurable impact on global GHG concentrations and climate change. Specifically, EPA argues that reducing GHG emissions from light- and medium-duty vehicles in the U.S. through the use of existing technology would have a minimal impact on global climate change. Further, EPA argues that, at a minimum, the “requisite technology” would require replacing internal combustion engines with electric vehicles or other no-emissions technology. EPA asserts that such a fuel shift is indistinguishable from the emission shifting barred by the Supreme Court’s ruling in West Virginia v. EPA. EPA similarly states that there is no “requisite technology” for heavy-duty vehicles capable of controlling global GHG emissions.

EPA also asserts that the agency does not need to make an endangerment finding when the regulatory authority used to address the finding would be ineffective on the identified dangers. Here, EPA states that the agency should consider whether the regulatory tools of the CAA would be effective in addressing global climate change. EPA notes that because reducing GHG emissions through vehicle emissions standards would have a minimal effect on global climate change, it would be improper for the agency to implement emissions standards when reduction in GHG emissions outside the U.S. would be most effective in addressing a global issue.

Lastly, EPA also proposes to repeal all vehicle emissions standards because emissions standards increase the price of vehicles to consumers and therefore disincentivize consumers from purchasing newer vehicles that are safer and emit fewer air pollutants, including criteria and hazardous air pollutants. EPA asserts that this is contrary to the broader goals of the CAA.

Proposed Repeal of Greenhouse Gas Emissions Standards for Fossil Fuel-Fired Electric Generating Units

Overview and History

On June 17, 2025, EPA issued a proposed rule that would repeal the GHG emissions standards for “fossil fuel”-fired (i.e., coal-, oil- and gas-fired) EGUs such as power plants. If finalized, the GHG EGU Proposed Rule would alter the federal framework for regulating GHG emissions from fossil fuel-fired EGUs under the CAA.

In 2015, the Obama Administration finalized the Clean Power Plan (CPP). The CPP aimed to reduce carbon emissions through the implementation of generation shifting technologies at existing fossil fuel-fired power plants. The CPP was promulgated under Section 111(d) of the CAA and set ambitious performance standards for existing power plants. However, due to litigation leading to the issuance of a stay by the U.S. Supreme Court, the CPP was never implemented. In 2015, the Obama Administration also finalized New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) for new power plants (the 2015 NSPS). In the GHG EGU Proposed Rule, EPA acknowledges that the 2015 NSPS rely on the conclusions in the 2009 Endangerment Finding. In 2019, the Trump Administration formally repealed the CPP and promulgated the Affordable Clean Energy Rule (ACE). This rule was discussed at length in our prior Alert. The ACE did not establish specific limits on emissions; rather, it promoted the employment of a broad range of heat rate improvement technologies and techniques such that EGUs would generate electricity more efficiently with less carbon intensity. However, like its predecessor, the ACE was never implemented due to a vacatur by the D.C. Circuit and a repeal of the ACE by the Biden Administration in the preamble to its GHG emissions rule (the 2024 GHG Emissions Rule). The 2024 GHG Emissions Rule was promulgated by EPA in May 2024 and included a set of actions targeting GHG emissions from new, modified, reconstructed and existing fossil fuel-fired EGUs. This rule was discussed at length in our prior Alert.

In 2024, the 2024 GHG Emissions Rule was challenged by 27 states and industry groups who filed petitions for review in the D.C. Circuit. In July 2024, the court denied a request to stay the 2024 GHG Emissions Rule. Following the recent change in administration, the D.C. Circuit agreed to hold the case in abeyance pending further actions by the agency. In EPA’s status report provided to the court on July 24, 2025, EPA notes that EPA intends to issue a final rule by December 2025. The next status report is due on October 22, 2025.

On June 17, 2025, EPA proposed to repeal the 2015 NSPS and the 2024 GHG Emissions Rule with the GHG EGU Proposed Rule. This action comes in response to Executive Order 14154, “Unleashing American Energy,” which directs federal agencies “to identify those agency actions that impose an undue burden on the identification, development, or use of domestic energy resources — with particular attention to oil, natural gas, coal, hydropower, biofuels, critical mineral, and nuclear energy resources.” The GHG EGU Proposed Rule includes a primary proposal (complete repeal) and an alternative proposal (targeted repeal) of the 2024 GHG Emissions Rule and 2015 NSPS. EPA’s primary proposal makes two major changes: (i) it proposes to require a “significant contribution” finding as a predicate to regulation; and (ii) it proposes that GHG emissions do not contribute significantly to air pollution under the CAA. If adopted, EPA’s primary proposal would repeal all GHG standards for the power sector from the 2015 NSPS and the 2024 GHG Emissions Rule. Alternatively, EPA is proposing a targeted rollback of many consequential elements of the 2024 GHG Emissions Rule. EPA’s alternative proposal would: (i) repeal the emission guidelines for existing fossil fuel-fired steam generating units; (ii) repeal the CCS-based requirements for coal-fired steam generating units undertaking a large modification; and (iii) repeal the phase 2 CCS-based requirements for new base load combustion turbine EGUs.

EPA’s Primary Proposal

EPA Proposes a “Significant Contribution” Requirement

In the GHG EGU Proposed Rule, EPA is proposing to reinterpret Section 111(b) of the CAA to require the agency to demonstrate that emissions from a pollutant emitted by an existing source category “cause, or contribute significantly to” air pollution before it may regulate that pollutant. Section 111 of the CAA authorizes EPA to list categories of emission sources (source categories) and, once listed, establish standards of performance that reflect the best systems for reducing emissions from those sources. EPA can list a source category if it determines that the source category “causes, or contributes significantly to” air pollution. In the 2015 NSPS, EPA stated that it was not required to make a separate significant contribution finding for a category that included all fossil fuel-fired EGUs because sources within the category had previously been listed under Section 111(b). Thus, EPA combined two source categories — steam generators and combustion turbines — into a single source category, “fossil fuel-fired electricity generating units,” in the 2015 NSPS. Because each original source category had been determined to “cause, or contribute significantly to” air pollution, EPA treated the new consolidated category as inheriting the same significant contribution status.

The GHG EGU Proposed Rule reverses this interpretation. EPA now proposes that the agency should make a pollutant-specific “significant contribution” determination every time it seeks to regulate a new pollutant from an existing source category. EPA reads the CAA’s “causes, or contributes significantly to” as requiring two significant contribution findings: one at the time of listing the source category and another each time EPA wants to regulate a particular pollutant from an existing category. In the context of the 2015 NSPS and the 2024 GHG Emissions Rule, this new interpretation would require EPA to determine that GHG emissions from EGUs “contribute significantly” to air pollution before regulation could proceed. In the alternative, EPA proposes that Section 111 at least authorizes the agency to decide to require a significant contribution determination. Under the GHG EGU Proposed Rule, if EPA determines that GHG emissions from power plants do not significantly contribute to air pollution, EPA would have no authority to impose standards of performance for GHG emissions from power plants.

EPA Proposes that GHG Emissions do not “Significantly Contribute” to Relevant Pollution

EPA also proposes that GHG emissions from fossil fuel-fired power plants do not contribute significantly to air pollution under the CAA. Section 111 of the CAA triggers regulation if the agency concludes that the emissions “contribute significantly” to dangerous air pollution. Historically, EPA considered GHG emissions from power plants to satisfy this standard. The agency reasoned that the power plant sector’s global tonnage was large and that even incremental decreases in emissions would reduce global climate impacts. This finding underpinned the 2015 NSPS and the 2024 GHG Emissions Rule.

In the GHG EGU Proposed Rule, EPA seeks to reinterpret the phrase “contributes significantly” in the CAA to include consideration of policy issues inherent in the statutory structure that include effectiveness and cost-reasonableness of emissions reduction controls, impacts on affected industry, and impacts of the emissions on public health and welfare. EPA contends that potential emissions reduction tools, including generation shifting, carbon capture technology, natural gas co-firing and heat rate improvements, are either not allowed under existing legal precedent, not adequately demonstrated or cost prohibitive. EPA continues that because the agency is unlikely to develop a system of emissions reduction that would result in meaningful, cost-reasonable emission reductions, the contribution of power plants to air pollution is not significant within the meaning of the CAA. Further, EPA proposes to reinterpret “contributes significantly” to include principles of proximate causation. EPA contends that the share of GHG emissions from the U.S. power sector is minor compared to other countries and has been declining over time. Thus, the relative contribution of GHG emissions from U.S. power plants as well as the attenuated nature of the causal chain between GHG emissions volume from this source category and danger to public health may not be a significant contribution to global GHG concentrations, particularly given the discretion conferred by the term “significant” to the agency. EPA contends that GHG emissions from power plants do not rise to a level that justifies invoking regulation under Section 111.

EPA’s Alternative Proposal: Targeted Repeal of Existing Standards

As an alternative to the finding that GHG emissions do not contribute significantly to air pollution, EPA proposes to repeal specific portions of existing regulation. Specifically, EPA reasons that the 2024 GHG Emissions Rule was premised on CCS and fuel-switching technology that is not commercially viable or effective. The alternative proposal in the GHG EGU Proposed Rule would: (i) repeal the 90% CCS requirement for existing long-term coal units; (ii) repeal the 40% natural gas co-firing requirement for medium-term coal units; (iii) repeal the emission guidelines for existing fossil fuel-fired steam generating units in their entirety; (iv) repeal the 90% CSS requirement for coal units undertaking large modifications; and (v) repeal the 90% CCS requirements for new base load turbines. The alternative proposal does not modify the requirements for new and reconstructed intermediate load and low load turbines or phase 1 requirements for new and reconstructed base load turbines. Further, the 2015 NSPS would be preserved under the alternative proposal. EPA reached these conclusions by re-evaluating the costs and assumptions undergirding the best systems of emission reduction (BSER) for fossil fuel-fired power plants in the 2024 GHG Emissions Rule. For each targeted repeal in the GHG EGU Proposed Rule, EPA applied the traditional CAA Section 111 BSER criteria: adequacy of demonstration, cost, non-air-quality impacts and energy requirements. For each criteria, EPA reached conclusions that departed from those it made last year in the 2024 GHG Emissions Rule. EPA also emphasized the Supreme Court’s ruling in West Virginia v. EPA pertaining to EPA’s inability to compel large shifts in energy technology without clear authorization from Congress. If EPA does not adopt its primary proposal, the alternative proposal would impose a lighter-touch framework to federal power plant regulation than what exists under the 2024 GHG Emissions Rule.

Implications

The Endangerment Finding Proposed Rule, if finalized, could have sweeping impacts on many environmental regulations, as the Endangerment Finding underlies multiple EPA regulations, beyond just fuel efficiency and pollutant emissions standards for cars. The EPA has historically used the same analytical framework as the 2009 Endangerment Finding in other areas of CAA regulation including stationary source permitting, emission standards for power plants and other stationary sources, aircrafts and oil and gas operations. Further, EPA states that the Endangerment Finding Proposed Rule will provide greater certainty and regulatory relief to auto manufacturers. The American Trucking Association stated that the proposal would alleviate supply chain issues and higher prices. By contrast, environmental groups have criticized the Endangerment Finding Proposed Rule for lacking a scientific basis and seeking to invalidate climate regulations. Thus, significant legal challenges immediately following rule finalization are expected.

Upon finalization of the Endangerment Finding and GHG EGU Proposed Rules, expected ensuing litigation may also poise the Supreme Court to reconsider its original ruling in Massachusetts v. EPA, which affirmed EPA’s authority to regulate GHGs as air pollutants. It is uncertain when EPA is expected to finalize this proposed rule, until EPA issues its Spring 2025 Unified Regulatory Agenda.

Timeline

Comments on the proposed repeal of the Endangerment Finding are due by September 22, 2025. Comments on the GHG EGU Proposed Rule were due on August 7, 2025, and comments on the MATS Proposed Rule were due by August 11, 2025. Additionally, virtual public hearings for the Endangerment Findings were held in late August 2025. Information on the timing for rule finalization will become available upon publication of EPA’s Spring 2025 Unified Regulatory Agenda by the Office of Management and budget Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs.

In a forthcoming book on the history of U.S. law and the environment, Brigham Daniels and I identify a long history of damaging actions by presidents, often with the support of Congress and acceptance by the judiciary — including the destruction of once plentiful species and even entire ecosystems.

This was the case in what we identify as the Allocation era (1781-1890) and Modernization era (1920-1960) of U.S. environmental law. Following each of these periods — first in the Progressive era and then in the Environmental era — democratic institutions adopted a cascade of local, state and federal laws, developed to eliminate or at least reduce the harms caused or facilitated by law.

Though far from sufficient, these laws helped promote the preservation, conservation and sustained use of natural resources and the protection of human health caused by harmful products or pollution from development or the production of goods. These laws remain the backbone of environmental protection today. With the bipartisan trillion-dollar congressional investments from the 2021 infrastructure bill and 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, a long overdue but nonetheless unparallelled energy transition was underway.

In just a few months, however, the second Trump administration has been trying its best to launch the most audacious assault on environmental protection law in the history of our nation. The habitually unlawful actions are far too many to list, but a few are worth mentioning.

The Trump administration has:

• announced a preposterous “national energy emergency” that combines ill-fated and expensive attempts to resurrect dirty coal as a leading energy source, as well as massively increase liquified natural gas exports (increasing U.S. pollution and energy costs), and set forth an unparalleled barrage of vindictive and illogical assaults on renewable energy sources;

• officially bragged about EPA’s “Biggest Deregulatory Action in U.S. History,” including 31 actions designed or universally understood to increase pollution;

• sought to eviscerate transparency and participation in environmental decisions, including repealing long-established regulations interpreting the National Environmental Policy Act and introducing “alternative NEPA procedures” that reduce timelines over consequential decisions to as little as two weeks;

• attacked science and scientific integrity by massively slashing federal research funding, and defunding, de-staffing and eliminating agency offices and branches dedicated to advancing science, like EPA’s Office of Research and Development;

• ceased or significantly cut enforcement of essential environmental protections (or allowed industry to email the president to fast-track exemptions); and

• gutted public health and food safety programs, such as those dedicated to addressing bird flu and milk quality testing.

All this, in fewer than 200 days since this devastating presidential term began.

Last month, however, the Trump administration took perhaps its most destructive and regressive step yet: proposing to overturn the EPA’s 16-year-old finding that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases cause or contribute to human and environmental harm. This finding, supported by overwhelming scientific evidence at the time and even more so today, is the basis for EPA regulation of pollution that causes climate change.

This action is willful and even boastful of its ignorance about climate science. It attempts to distort established law, including 2022 congressional approval of greenhouse gas regulation and U.S. Supreme Court precedent. It adds to the already harmful instability of U.S. energy markets caused by the president’s disastrous tariff policies. And, of course, it threatens to undo the progress profoundly needed for human and ecological health in the U.S. and around the world to reduce the extent of global climate change.

Given the incomparably advanced state of scientific knowledge today, the global scale of potential harm and the clear opportunities readily available and increasingly demonstrated to both promote environmental protection while advancing economic development — not to mention the willful denial and “legal” assault on each of these elements — anyone would be hard pressed to not identify the second Trump administration as the worst in its choices and actions.

In time, we will see how much harm the courts will allow, or whether (this or a new) Congress will step up to stop these reckless actions. But it certainly looks like this president, cheered on by his dirty energy collaborators, has won the shameful title of “Worst President for the Environment in US History” in record time.

The White House has aggressively targeted policies that benefit wind energy in recent weeks. Following the Friday announcement, shares in Orsted tumbled 17% to a record low.

2. Trump’s restrictions on renewables have killed $19 billion in projects

Trump’s clampdown on wind and solar has sent the industry spiraling in recent weeks as federal agencies limit access to clean energy tax credits and rework rules to disfavor the industry’s two largest sources of energy. Already, $18.6 billion worth of clean energy projects have been canceled this year, compared to just $827 million last year, according to data from Atlas Public Policy’s Clean Economy Tracker cited in the Financial Times.

Trump has blamed renewables for the rising price of electricity. But data Matthew covered last week showed that renewables are, if anything, correlated with lower prices. Instead, he wrote, at the “top of the list” of reasons electricity prices are surging “is the physical reality of the grid itself,” the poles and wires required to send energy into people’s homes and businesses. “Beyond that, extreme weather, natural gas prices, and data center-induced demand growth all play a part.”

3. Environmental lawsuit kills ‘Alligator Alcatraz’

Together with the state of Florida, the Trump administration rushed to build what it calls “Alligator Alcatraz,” a detention facility designed to hold several thousand migrants at a time in southern Florida. In its haste to complete the facility, however, the government failed to conduct the proper environmental reviews, according to a federal judge who ordered its closure late last week, The Wall Street Journal reported. Back in June, a pair of nonprofits filed a lawsuit alleging that the government had failed to conduct assessments of what impact the facility would have on endangered animals such as the Florida panther and the Florida bonneted bat. The Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida later joined the lawsuit.

The Trump administration argued that the law in question, the National Environmental Policy Act, only applies to federal projects, whereas this one was state-driven, an argument Judge Kathleen Williams rejected, according to the Journal. “Every Florida governor, every Florida senator, and countless local and national political figures, including presidents, have publicly pledged their unequivocal support for the restoration, conservation, and protection of the Everglades,” she wrote. “This Order does nothing more than uphold the basic requirements of legislation designed to fulfill those promises.”

4. Amazon states rally behind COP30

The eight countries that ring the Amazon rainforest pledged support over the weekend for a global pool of financing for conservation. In a joint declaration, the Amazonian nations — Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, Peru, Suriname, and Venezuela — expressed support for preserving the rainforest but stopped short of endorsing any curbs on fossil fuels. The statement comes as South America has emerged as the world’s hottest oil patch, with new discoveries moving forward off the coasts of Guyana and Brazil and Argentina advancing plans for a fracking boom.

5. Antarctica is facing grave new climate perils

“Abrupt changes” like the precipitous loss of sea ice are unfolding in Antarctica, highlighting the growing threat global warming poses to the frozen continent, according to a new paper in the journal Nature. These changes could push the Antarctic ecosystem past a point of no return, the authors wrote.

“We’re seeing a whole range of abrupt and surprising changes developing across Antarctica, but these aren’t happening in isolation,” climate scientist Nerilie Abram, lead author of the paper, told Grist. “When we change one part of the system, that has knock-on effects that worsen the changes in other parts of the system. And we’re talking about changes that also have global consequences.”

THE KICKER

Bad news for vegans who evangelize their diets on good health grounds: New research found no increased risk of death “associated with higher intake of animal protein. In fact, the data showed a modest but significant reduction in cancer-related mortality among those who ate more animal protein.” That, however, doesn’t change the huge difference in emissions between red meat and plant food products.

“If you can accelerate the decrease of methane in the atmosphere, you actually could have a much more significant climate impact, much faster than with CO2,” Gabrielle Dreyfus, chief scientist at the Institute for Governance & Sustainable Development, told me. “People often talk about gigatons of CO2 removal. But because of the potency of methane, for a similar level of temperature impact, you’re talking about megatons.”

Over the past year or so, this conversation has finally started to gain traction. Last October, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine released a report on atmospheric methane removal, recommending that the U.S. develop a research agenda for methane removal technologies and establish methodologies to assess their impacts. Dreyfus chaired the committee that authored the report.

And one startup, at least — Denmark-based Ambient Carbon — is trying to commercialize its methane-zapping tech. Last week, the company announced that it had successfully trialed its “methane eradication photochemical system” at a dairy barn in Denmark, eliminating the majority of methane from the barn’s air. It’s also aiming to deploy a prototype in the U.S., at a farm in Indiana, by year’s end.

The way the company’s process works is more akin to point source carbon capture, in which emissions are pulled from a smokestack, than it is to something like direct air capture, in which carbon dioxide is removed from ambient air. Inside a dairy barn, cows are continually belching methane, producing high concentrations of the gas that are typically vented into the atmosphere. Instead, Ambient Carbon captures this noxious air from the barn’s ventilation ducts and brings it into an enclosed reactor.

Inside the reactor, which uses electricity from the grid, UV light activates chlorine molecules, splitting their chemical bonds to form unstable radicals. These radicals then react with methane, breaking down the potent gas and converting it into CO2, water, and other byproducts. The whole process mimics the natural destruction of atmospheric methane, which would normally take a decade or more, while Ambient Carbon’s system does it in a matter of seconds. Much of the chlorine gets recycled back into the process, and the CO2 is released into the air.

That might sound less than ideal. Famously, carbon dioxide is bad. This molecule alone is responsible for two-thirds of all human-caused global warming. But because methane is over 80 times as potent as CO2 over a 20-year timeframe, and since it would eventually break down into carbon dioxide in the atmosphere anyway, accelerating that inevitable process turns out to be a net good for the climate.

“The amount of CO2 produced by methane when it oxidizes has about 50 times smaller climate effect than the methane that produced it,” Zeke Hausfather, a climate scientist and climate research lead at Stripe, told me. “So you get a 98% reduction in the warming effects by converting methane to CO2, which I think is a pretty good deal.”

As he sees it, preventing methane emissions in the first place or destroying the molecules before they’re released, as Ambient Carbon is doing, is far more impactful than pursuing after-the-fact atmospheric methane removal. Because while CO2 can linger in the air for centuries — making removal a necessity for near-term planetary cooling — when it comes to methane, “if you cut emissions, you cool the planet pretty quickly, because all that previous warming from methane goes away over the course of a decade or two.”

Agriculture represents 40% of global methane emissions, the largest single source, making the industry a ripe target for de-methane-ization. Ambient Carbon’s tech is only really effective when methane concentrations are relatively high, the company’s CSO, Matthew Johnson, told me — which still leaves a large addressable market given that in many parts of the world, cows are mostly kept in dairy barns, where methane accumulates.

In its trial, Ambient Carbon’s system eliminated up to 90% of dairy barn methane at concentrations ranging from 4.3 parts per million to 44 parts per million. But while the system can theoretically operate at the lower end of that range, Johnson told me it’s only truly energy efficient at 20 parts per million and above. “It’s a question of cost benefit, because we could remove 99% [of the methane from dairy barns] but if you do that, that marginal cost is more energy,” Johnson explained, telling me that the company’s system will likely aim to remove between 80% to 90% of barn methane.

One reason methane destruction and removal technology hasn’t gained much traction is that capturing methane — whether from the atmosphere, a smokestack, or a ventilation duct — is far more challenging than capturing CO2, given that it’s so much less prevalent in the atmosphere. Atmospheric methane is relatively diffuse, with an average concentration of just about 2 parts per million, compared with roughly 420 parts per million for CO2. “I heard the analogy used that if pulling carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere is finding a needle in a haystack, pulling methane out of the atmosphere is pulling dust off the needle in that haystack,” Dreyfus told me.

Because of methane’s relative chemical stability, removing it from the air also requires a strong oxidant, such as chlorine radicals, to break it down. CO2 on the other hand, can be separated from the air with sorbents or membranes, which is a technically simpler process.

Other nascent approaches to methane destruction and removal include introducing chlorine radicals into the open atmosphere and adding soil amendments to boost the effectiveness of natural methane sinks. Among these options, Ambient Carbon’s approach is the furthest along, most well-understood, and likely also lowest-risk. After its successful field trial, “there is not much uncertainty remaining about whether or not this does the claimed thing,” Sam Abernethy, a methane removal scientist at the nonprofit Spark Climate Solutions, told me. “The main questions remaining are whether they can be cost-effective at progressively lower concentrations, whether they can get more methane destroyed per energy input. And that’s something they’ve been improving every year since they started.”

Venture firms have yet to jump onboard though. Thus far, Ambient Carbon’s funding has come from agricultural partners such as Danone North America and Benton Group Dairies, which are working with the company to conduct its field trials. Additional collaboration and financial support comes from organizations such as the Hofmansgave Foundation, a Danish philanthropic group, and Innovation Fund Denmark. Johnson told me the startup also has a number of unnamed angel investors.

Whether or not this tech could ever become efficient enough to tackle more dilute methane emissions — and thus make true atmospheric methane removal feasible — remains highly uncertain. Questions also remain about how these technologies, if proven to be workable, would ultimately be able to scale. For instance, would methane destruction and removal depend more on government policies and regulations, or on market-based incentives?

In the short term, voluntary corporate commitments appear to be the main drivers of interest when it comes to methane destruction specifically. “A lot of food companies have made public pledges that they’re going to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions,” Johnson told me. As he noted, ubiquitous brands such as Kraft Heinz, General Mills, Danone, and Starbucks have all joined the Dairy Methane Action Alliance, which aims to “accelerate action and ambition to drive down methane emissions across dairy supply chains,” according to its website.

The way Ambient Carbon envisions this market working, its food industry partners would be the ones to encourage farms to buy the startup’s methane-destroying units, and would pay farmers a premium for producing low-emissions products. This would enable farmers to cover the system’s cost within five years, and eventually generate additional revenue. Whether the food companies would pass the green premium onto consumers, however, remains to be seen.

But as with the carbon dioxide removal sector, voluntary corporate commitments and carbon crediting schemes will likely only go so far. “Most of what’s going to drive methane elimination is going to be policy,” Hausfather told me. Denmark, where Ambient Carbon conducted its first trial, is set to become the first country in the world to implement a tax on agricultural emissions, starting in 2030. Europe also has a comprehensive greenhouse gas reduction framework, as do states such as California, Washington, and New York.

“It’s such a low-hanging fruit of climate impacts that it’s hard to imagine it’s not going to be regulated pretty substantially in the future,” Hausfather told me. But stringent regulatory requirements are often shaped by the technologies that have been established as effective. And in that sense, what Ambient Carbon is doing today could help pave the way for the ambitious methane targets of tomorrow.

“Moving from a lot of the voluntary pledges that we have towards more mandatory requirements I think is going to have a really important role to play,” Dreyfus told me. “But I think it’s going to be easier if we have more proven technologies to get there.”

The Trump administration launched an investigation into imported wind turbines and parts, teeing up what Bloomberg called a “potential precursor to adding more tariffs on the clean-energy components.” The Department of Commerce started a national security probe on August 13 to query whether the imports undermine domestic production and put the country at risk from foreign opponents, according to a notice posted Thursday on the agency’s website. The agency already said this week that it would include wind turbines and related parts on the list of products facing 50% steel and aluminum tariffs. As of 2023, at least 41% of wind-related equipment to the U.S. came from Mexico, Canada, and China, according to figures Bloomberg cited from the consultancy Wood Mackenzie.

2. Treasury Department sets phaseouts for efficient home and EV tax credits

Also on Thursday, the Treasury Department published an FAQ document outlining the phaseout dates for eight key energy efficiency tax credits repealed under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. The rules all deal with zero-carbon vehicles or energy efficiency rebates for home improvements.

25C, the energy efficient home improvement credit, will not be allowed for any renovations completed after December 31, 2025.

25D, the residential clean energy tax credit, will not be allowed for any expenditures made after December 31, 2025.

25E, the previously-owned clean vehicles credit, will not be allowed for any vehicle purchased after September 30, 2025.

30C, the alternative fuel vehicle refueling property credit, will not be allowed for any property placed in service after June 30, 2026.

30D, the new clean vehicle credit, will not be allowed for any vehicle purchased after September 30, 2025.

45L, the new energy efficient home credit, will not be allowed for any new energy efficient home purchased after June 30, 2026.

45W, the commercial clean vehicle credit, will not be allowed for any vehicle purchased after September 30, 2025.

179D, the energy efficient commercial buildings deduction, will not be allowed for any property that starts construction after June 30, 2026.

As Heatmap’s Emily Pontecorvo and Robinson Meyer wrote when the first tranche of data on the programs came out around this time last year, millions of Americans had already taken advantage of at least one of the credits. But the uptake was largely concentrated among households earning $100,000 per year or more.

3. Two major international deals set the stage for more U.S. nuclear exports

For years, Westinghouse has been locked in an intellectual property dispute with South Korea’s two state-owned nuclear companies, as the American atomic energy giant accused the Korea Electric Power Corporation and its subsidiary, Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power, of ripping off its reactor technology. This week, the companies brokered a settlement that would keep the Korean giants from bidding on projects in North America, Europe, Japan, the United Kingdom, and Ukraine, effectively eliminating what is arguably the United States’ most capable rival outside of Russia and China from the key markets Washington wants to dominate. That could spur a lot more bids for Westinghouse’s flagship gigawatt-sized AP1000 reactor, projects for which are already underway in Poland, Slovakia, and Ukraine. But KoreaPro reported on Thursday that South Korea is pushing back on a deal Seoul fears infringes on its sovereignty.

In Sweden, meanwhile, the U.S.-Japanese joint venture GE Vernova-Hitachi Nuclear Energy secured a new deal to build its 300-megawatt small modular reactor that the government in Stockholm explicitly pitched as a bid to strengthen its trans-Atlantic security ties. “This is the beginning of something bigger, in many ways,” Ebba Busch, Sweden’s deputy prime minister, wrote in a post on LinkedIn. “As in the NATO process, Sweden is part of a larger movement.”

4. Energy Department extends order to keep Midwest fossil fuel plants open

The Department of Energy extended its emergency order directing the J.H. Campbell Generating Plant in Michigan to remain open past its planned retirement. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright initially ordered the 1,420-megawatt coal station to stay online three months past its May 31 shutdown date, citing risks of electricity shortages in the Midcontinent Independent System Operator, the electrical grid that runs from the Upper Midwest down to Louisiana. Starting Thursday, the latest order directs the plant’s owners to keep the station running November 19. The consultancy Grid Strategies estimated last week that if the Trump administration expands the effort to cover all 54 aging fossil fuel plants slated for closure between now and 2028, the program will cost upward of $6 billion. Last week, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission approved a framework for the utilities that own the affected plants to recoup the costs of operating the power stations past the closure dates from ratepayers, despite surging electricity prices.

5. Data center industry backs plan to use electricity more flexibly

The Data Center Coalition, a leading trade association representing the burgeoning server farm industry, has endorsed adopting programs to curb electricity demand when the grid is under stress. In a filing Thursday with the North Carolina Utility Commission, the industry group said it “supports exploring well-structured, voluntary demand-response and load flexibility programs for large load customers that allocates risk appropriately, provides clear incentives and compensation, and allows customers to meet their sustainability commitments.”

Researchers at Duke University put out an influential paper in February that found the U.S. could add gigawatts of additional demand from new data centers without building out an equivalent amount of generating plants if those facilities could curtail power usage when demand was particularly high. Heatmap’s Matthew Zeitlin described the strategy as “one weird trick for getting more data centers on the grid,” boiling down the approach simply as: “Just turn them off sometimes.” When I interviewed Tyler Norris, the study’s lead author, he pitched the idea as a way “to buy us some time” to figure out exactly how much electricity the artificial intelligence boom requires before we build out a bunch of gas plants that are even more expensive than usual due to the years-long backorder of turbines.

THE KICKER

Researchers at the University of Houston claim to have made two major breakthroughs in carbon capture technology. The first breakthrough, published in the journal Nature Communications, introduces a new electrochemical process for filtering out carbon dioxide that avoids using a membrane like traditional carbon capture technology. The second, featured on the cover of the journal ES&T Engineering, demonstrates a new vanadium-based flow battery that could be used both to capture carbon and to store renewable energy. “We need solutions, and we wanted to be part of the solution. The biggest suspect out there is CO2 emissions, so the low-hanging fruit would be to eliminate those emissions,” Mim Rahimi, a professor at the University of Houston’s Cullen College of Engineering, said in a statement. “From membraneless systems to scalable flow systems, we’re charting pathways to decarbonize hard-to-abate sectors and support the transition to a low-carbon economy.”",https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MTUxMTE4OS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc1NzcwNjk3MX0.KM20JWsNiLHD8fqz0oxKswsAgqQuqKQZh-RDoHDxCAo/image.jpg?width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C100%2C0%2C100,N,,2025-08-25 16:06:56.106232

Additionally, the Reliability Imperative may drive utilities and regulators to delay coal-fired power plant retirements.

On Monday, Aug. 25, the EPA announced that it was proposing to disapprove of California’s Heavy-Duty Inspection and Maintenance Requirements as they apply to out-of-state and out-of-country vehicles.

The agency expressed concern these requirements violate the U.S. Constitution’s Commerce Clause, as well as Section 110 of the Clean Air Act.

“California was not, and has never been, duly elected by the American people to run our great country,” EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said in a news release. “The state’s power grab knows no bounds. EPA will not allow California to violate federal law, and we will not sit idly by while, in the name of climate change, they raise the cost of living on all Americans who rely on truck drivers and the products they deliver across the country.”

The EPA added that it “will not allow California to violate federal law in a manner that foists yet another attack on truck drivers and engine manufacturers who provide the food and products we need to survive.”

The EPA’s proposed rule is scheduled to be published in the Federal Register on Tuesday, Aug. 26. Once that happens, the public will have 30 days to comment. To do so, go to Regulations.gov and enter EPA-R09-OAR-2025-0061.

The Federal Trade Commission recently closed its antitrust investigation into the Clean Truck Partnership. The agreement involved top truck manufacturers and their trade group, the Truck and Engine Manufacturers Association. They signed the deal with the California Air Resources Board (CARB).

Signed in 2023, the Clean Truck Partnership requires manufacturers to follow California’s truck emission standards. These include the Omnibus Low NOx rule, Advanced Clean Fleets and Advanced Clean Trucks. A key part of the agreement binds truck makers to these rules, even if California loses the authority to enforce them.

On his first day back in office, President Donald Trump signed an executive order aimed at “unleashing American energy.” This order includes a directive to remove government-imposed market distortions favoring electric vehicles over other technologies.

In June, Trump signed three resolutions that killed California’s vehicle emission rules.

According to the EPA, the waivers “would have raised costs, restricted consumer choice and strained the electric grid. LL",https://landline.media/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/08-25-25-EPA-pic.jpg,N,,2025-08-25 16:05:30.169285

They say they’re unnecessary and outdated, and it’s time to let the free market dictate where our energy comes from.
GILGER: Let me ask you a political question here, because APS also announced recently it’s dropping its clean energy goals for itself.
GILGER: It’s interesting because when you voted for these standards 20 years ago, you were a Republican on the Corporation Commission.
THOMPSON: It’s a mandate.","It seems like every summer in the Valley, we’re hitting new records for heat — and for energy use.

As temperatures soar and more people — and data centers — move to the Valley, everyone has to use air conditioning to battle that heat all at once. And it’s making it harder for energy companies to keep up with demand.

APS announced a new energy use record when we clocked a record 8,631 megawatts between 5 and 6 p.m. on Aug. 7.

At the same time, we’re seeing energy regulators move to roll back requirements that utility companies here get a certain amount of energy from renewable sources like solar and wind power.

The mandate was set in Arizona nearly two decades ago by the Corporation Commission at 15%. It’s been credited with spurring a growing renewables market and moving the state in a clean energy direction.

But now, the all-Republican commission is moving to get rid of those requirements, Renewable Energy Standard and Tariff (REST) rules. They say they’re unnecessary and outdated, and it’s time to let the free market dictate where our energy comes from.

Arizona’s Democratic Attorney General Kris Mayes isn’t happy about it. She was one of the commissioners who voted for the requirements to begin with — when she was a Republican on the Corporation Commission in the early 2000s.

She says the move is illegal because regulators have a constitutional duty to set just and reasonable rates for consumers, and these commissioners provided no evidence that eliminating the standards will protect ratepayers or be in the public interest.

In fact, she argues renewables are the cheapest kind of energy and without standards in place, we’ll see utilities turn to less “clean” alternatives, like natural gas.

Earlier this month, all of the state’s major utilities announced a $5.3 billion project to build a major natural gas pipeline from Texas to Arizona. They say they need it to keep up with the demand on our energy grid. But, Mayes says the real reason is easy to find.

Full conversation with Kris Mayes

KRIS MAYES: The utilities make more money when they build natural gas plants because they can put that into what’s called rate base and then slap a rate of return on it, and therefore they make more money. And you add to that the fact that natural gas plants are powered with natural gas, and guess who pays for the cost of that natural gas? The ratepayers, the consumers of the state of Arizona.

You compare that to solar and wind — well, there’s no fuel source except the sun and the wind. And so it’s very simple economics. And the evidence proves that out. We know that the cost of clean energy has declined precipitously and in tandem with the renewable energy standard rules that we set up 20 years ago. It is a huge and massive success story that the commission is now trying to drive a stake through.

LAUREN GILGER: So regulators say they want the market to drive this. If you let the market drive the choice in terms of how the utilities are going to get our power, that the renewables will be part of that mix, because, as you say, they often are cheaper. Do you think that that’s misguided?

MAYES: It is misguided because it ignores the way utilities act and the way the utilities make their money. I mean, this is a silly and a ridiculous argument on the part on behalf of these commissioners. This is not a regular market. These are utilities that are regulated and they have a captured rate base. Consumers can’t get away from these utilities.

And the way the rates are set is based on how big and how expensive the plant is that they put into rate base. And so they’re going to choose — every day of the week — they’re going to choose coal plants or natural gas plants because that juices up their rate base. They’re not going to choose renewables voluntarily, necessarily. What they’re going to choose is the thing that makes them the most money. That’s going to be natural gas.

And then the other thing I would say is that as the state grows and our population grows and the energy demand grows, that is definitely going to mean the utilities are going to be producing more electricity, more kilowatt hours, and that’s going to drive the amount of renewable energy as a percentage down if the commission doesn’t at least keep the percentage at 15%, which is what we set.

GILGER: Right. So they’ll also point out that utilities in our state are already beating those original goals, that these are sort of outdated. You’re saying that won’t hold up in the future?

MAYES: We will definitely be dipping below 15%, which, by the way, at this point is already way, way, way behind our surrounding states, which puts us at a competitive disadvantage when you think about where renewable energy companies might locate and renewable energy projects might locate. So, yeah, this is one of the dumbest things that I have seen come out of this commission.

And they’ve done some, I think, unwise things lately. This is a commission that really is doing the bidding of the utilities quite often right now.

GILGER: Let me ask you a political question here, because APS also announced recently it’s dropping its clean energy goals for itself. And we’ve definitely seen energy policy out of the Trump administration that is in line with this, that is not favoring renewables in these ways and is definitely favoring the free market over that. Do you think the timing of this is political?

MAYES: Oh, it’s totally political, yes. It certainly has to factor into this decision. We know that Donald Trump and in this Congress, this MAGA Congress, have slashed renewable energy credits. Trump is ordering specific utilities — this is insane — to keep specific coal plants open. He tried to order APS to keep the Cholla Generating Station open.

And so I think the utilities and this commission are playing to the fiddle of Donald Trump. And that’s just sad because the people who are going to get hurt are Arizonans.

GILGER: It’s interesting because when you voted for these standards 20 years ago, you were a Republican on the Corporation Commission. Do you think this reflects how much that definition has changed, I guess?

MAYES: Yeah, I’ll say. I was a Teddy Roosevelt Republican, and I don’t know that those actually exist anymore. I haven’t changed much really, personally or politically I think, since then. But those were the days when Republicans could be fiscally responsible and care about the environment and want to see our utilities diversify their energy mix.

And the other big thing — and the reason I think an all Republican commission voted for a 15% renewable energy standard — is we believe in competition. Renewable energy brings competition to the utilities. What do I mean by that? By allowing Arizonans and promoting Arizonans to put solar on their rooftops or do community solar, we are providing essentially at least some level of competition for these monopoly utilities so that consumers, residents can get away from them.

GILGER: Let me ask you lastly an environmental question here about what kind of message a move like this sends about the future and the quality of life we might want in this city going forward, especially as it gets hotter and especially as we see air quality go down.

MAYES: Yeah, I think it sends a terrible message. It sends a message that this Corporation Commission is OK, and our utilities are OK with becoming more and more dependent on natural gas. The ugly, dirty secret that the utilities don’t want you to know is that there are methane emissions along that entire pipeline, and especially associated with compressor stations for those natural gas pipelines, something that we are looking at out of the Attorney General’s Office.

So this is dirty energy. And now our utilities and our Corporation Commission want us to have more of it, not less.

As of Monday morning, Mayes hasn’t filed suit yet, and her office told The Show they’re still “evaluating all legal options.”

But Kevin Thompson, the Republican chair of the Arizona Corporation Commission, is not surprised the Democratic attorney general is not happy with this vote.

When he came into KJZZ’s studios recently, he said he agrees renewable energy is affordable today, but he argues the free market should decide whether or not utilities use it in their energy mix.

Full conversation with Kevin Thompson

KEVIN THOMPSON: You know, we’re very agnostic when it comes to energy technology, we want an all-of-the-above portfolio. We think that’s what it’s going to take to keep the power going and the lights on.

The rule put in place like requirements for 15%. Well, all of the utilities have already met that intent. APS is around 19%. I think Tucson Electric’s around 23%.

LAUREN GILGER: Right, so why not update the rules?

THOMPSON: Well, I think renewables are mainstream already, right? I don’t think we need to mandate our utilities to meet another intent. We’re seeing a lot of private investment coming into Arizona with renewables. Since I’ve been on the commission, we’ve approved renewables way more than we have thermal. And it just tells you that the market is dictating what is the most reliable and the cheapest, right?

And that’s something to remember as well is we’ve told the utilities that they have to do a low cost RFP. So they have to go out for a request for proposal for power, and they have to come back and show that the contracts that they’re getting into is the most affordable for the consumers.

GILGER: Right, right. So you mentioned that most of the utilities in the state, if not all, have already exceeded this 15% standard.

I wonder though, as we’re looking at the massive amount of energy demand in the Valley — I think we just met another record the other day, where it’s just the amount of power needed to keep houses cool in the heat of the summer here is just getting higher and higher as more people come, more data centers are built, more investment, etc.

Do you think that that could change? Like if these standards are not there, the utilities could very well say, “Well, we have too much and we have to go in another direction”?

THOMPSON: No, I don’t think so. I think there’s a lot of fearmongering out there, that if you do away with these rules, it’s all gonna flatline, it’s all gonna decline, the world’s over. And I’d say it’s not that, right?

Even though the utilities have already met the intent of the REST rules, you’re still seeing a lot of investment in renewables, not only from the utilities but from private equity.

GILGER: So when you’re looking at affordability versus reliability, you’re saying this has to be market driven. Do you think that renewables are less affordable or less reliable?

THOMPSON: No, I wouldn’t say they’re less affordable. I think they’re very affordable, and I think that’s why you’re seeing so much private investment coming into Arizona.

Reliable, really our peak demand, time frame is, is that 3-7 p.m. window, when everybody’s coming home from work, the kids are home, you’re making dinner, you’re taking showers, you’re doing laundry. That’s our peak demand.

And solar works really, really good. But not during our peak demand times, right? And so that’s where the battery storage comes into play, so we can help shift that demand curve and so I think everything plays its part. When the wind’s not blowing and the sun’s still shining, you’re good. When the sun’s not shining and the wind’s not blowing, you still have natural gas or you have Palo Verde, so we have other options in that portfolio, and that’s what it’s about.

GILGER: Right, so you’re referring to this idea of dispatchability, right? Like whether or not renewable energy is able to be stored to use when demand is higher. Isn’t that possible at this point with battery technology?

THOMPSON: It is. Most batteries right now only last about 3 to 4 hours. Technology is advancing, and that’s what’s really cool about this job because you, you get to see it almost daily.

So let’s let technology catch up, but let’s keep that broad portfolio of generation types.

GILGER: So it’s the chicken and the egg, right? Like what comes first here, the regulators enforcing mandates to make sure that that market catches up and renewables can be reliable in the future and can have that kind of technology you’re talking about, or should we let the market drive it itself? Like, do you think this sends the wrong message then?

THOMPSON: No. I think we’ve been very clear at the beginning that we want the market to be able to drive this, and I think you’re seeing the market respond. And you don’t need government in the way telling people, telling businesses how to run their businesses. If the market is dictating that this is still the most affordable, that’s what the utilities are going to go after is the most affordable.

GILGER: I heard at the meeting, the Corporation Commission meeting when this vote happened, some regulators referring to this as, as a subsidy. It’s a mandate, right?

THOMPSON: It’s a mandate. In our world, anytime you mandate something for a utility, it’s basically a blank check that says you’re allowed to recover your cost.

GILGER: So do you feel like this mandate was essentially a subsidy to the renewables market?

THOMPSON: Absolutely. I mean, again, I think it did what it was supposed to do.

I brought up some questions yesterday in the opening meeting about Solana, for example. I wanted to know: What is it costing the ratepayers? That was the Solana (solar) plant out in Gila Bend. At the time was probably one of the leading technologies, but it’s costing ratepayers 15 cents per kilowatt hour.

And APS told us yesterday that the same power they can buy right now for 2.5 cents. And so our consumers are paying almost, you know, 6 times the cost of what power should be costing.

GILGER: So you’re saying that the cost is passed on to the ratepayer. There was, there was a third party economic analysis done for the commission though on this, right, that said that the savings for consumers would be real small, like $1 or $2 a month on your utility bill.

They also cited concerns about certainty in the market going forward without these regulations. Do you have that concern?

THOMPSON: I don’t. Obviously, when you look at the economics, a dollar here and a dollar there adds up, right? And, when, when you’re looking at like what this commission’s done over the last 2.5 years, we’ve cut, you know, almost $1 billion out of the utilities’ budgets on, on stuff that we think is wasteful.

Maybe eliminating the REST rules is only a dollar here or a dollar there, but in the grand scheme of things when you really look at the wasteful spending and how much is being spent, it’s a big deal.

GILGER: Let me ask you about the Attorney General. Kris Mayes has said that this move is not a good idea, but also that she thinks it’s illegal. Are you concerned you could be facing litigation over this and how the Corporation Commission has gone about it?

THOMPSON: No, not at all. I said it earlier, too, that it’s typical for her to rattle her saber on things like this. We’re undoing a lot of things that she put in place that have cost ratepayers billions of dollars since she put them in place.

And so I’m not overly concerned. If she wants to litigate this, we’ll litigate it, that’s fine. We’ll win. I have no doubt. We have the authority to set rules and we have the authority to unset rules, you know, to repeal rules. And so all we’re simply doing is repealing a rule that was put in place that no longer needs to be in place.

GILGER: We’re seeing APS at the same time drop its own clean energy goals for itself, and, and this is all very in line with the Trump administration’s energy agenda. I wonder how much you think politics is coming into play.

Do you think these things are happening right now because of the general political environment?

THOMPSON: I think it has a little bit to do with the political environment. I would like to think that the utilities are starting to look at the demand that’s on the system and saying, “How are we going to meet tomorrow’s demand today?”

When you look at our pipeline, capacity on the pipelines coming in, bringing in natural gas, we’re at full capacity on those lines. And you’re not gonna build any more new coal plants. And if you’re three to six years out on your SMRs or nuclear, and you’re still 2027 or 2028 getting the pipeline in here, what’s left?

That’s why I think you’re still going to see renewables come online. When it’s 118 and it’s 120 and we’re hitting our max, if the power goes out, people are going to to to be hurt. The vulnerable population in Arizona is going to suffer, and I think the utilities are seeing that.

I think the writing is on the wall. And so I think yes, politics has played a little bit of a role in that. But I again, I would like to think that they’re looking at the bigger picture and saying, “How do we meet the demand tomorrow today?”",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5227f44/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8192x4301+0+189/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fdf%2Fcb%2Fe6d02f474c9bac02b34adaa09a4f%2Faps-sundance-natural-gas-power-plant-coolidge-20250825.jpg,N,,2025-08-25 16:04:19.950484

Partnership ties Tigo’s optimized inverters to EG4’s 310,000 sq. ft. Commerce facility

A new 310,000-square-foot manufacturing plant in Commerce, Texas, will soon be pumping out both Tigo Energy and EG4 Electronics solar power hardware. The two inverter brands formalized a partnership this week to co-produce Tigo’s optimized inverters and module level power electronics (MLPE) alongside EG4’s inverter products at the facility.

The combo facility formalizes what’s already happening in the field: EG4 inverters are often paired with Tigo MLPE devices, which are certified as compatible. Now, both product lines will roll off the same U.S. production line.

The two companies plan to highlight the partnership at the RE+ tradeshow in Las Vegas (Sept. 9–12, 2025), hosting a joint Q&A session for solar installers.

Manufacturing context

EG4’s parent company, Energy Access Innovations (EAI), acquired the Texas facility in March 2025. The site is expected to create more than 1,000 American jobs while anchoring part of the nation’s re-shoring push for energy hardware.

“We believe in energy autonomy for our customers just as much as we believe in manufacturing autonomy for American innovators,” said James Showalter, founder of EG4 Electronics. “This partnership with Tigo allows us to make significant progress on both of those fronts.”

Even though it has its own inverter, Tigo is most known for its MLPE and rapid shutdown solutions, which can be paired with other solar inverters. By aligning its inverter production with EG4’s U.S. manufacturing hub, Tigo gains a path toward higher domestic content.

“EG4 is at the forefront of re-shoring manufacturing for American solar innovations, and we are delighted to work in partnership with James and his team,” said Zvi Alon, chairman and CEO at Tigo Energy. “I expect great things for American energy independence from this important collaboration.”

Orders from the U.S. Department of Energy to save coal plants from retirement could cost ratepayers more than $3 billion per year, according to a report from Grid Strategies, a power sector consulting firm. It was carried out on behalf of Earthjustice, Environmental Defense Fund, Natural Resources Defense Council and Sierra Club.

Under Trump, the agency has issued emergency orders to maintain operations at coal plants that were scheduled for retirement. While federal officials say the coal plants need to stay online to avoid blackouts, power plant owners and state regulators planned their closures because they were no longer economically viable or needed for reliability.

“DOE mandates override those well-informed decisions, inflating electric bills for homeowners and businesses and undermining the competitiveness of U.S. factories and data centers,” the Grid Strategies analysis found.

Across the country, coal plants have phased out as they’ve struggled to compete with cheaper renewables and natural gas. A 2023 analysis by Energy Innovation, a nonpartisan think tank, found that 99% of existing U.S. coal plants “are more expensive to run than replacement by local wind, solar, and energy storage resources.”

But Trump, who has pushed to unleash more fossil fuel development and to stymie wind and solar, has ordered a retiring coal plant in Michigan to stay online, along with an oil and gas plant in Pennsylvania.

“Based on the trend to date and indications that DOE has approached the owners of many retiring fossil power plants about potentially mandating their retention, DOE may attempt to mandate the retention of nearly all large fossil power plants slated for retirement between now and the end of 2028,” reads the Grid Strategies report.

The cost of keeping those plants online would be immense. By 2028, if Trump were to mandate the retention of all fossil fuel plants slated for retirement, the annual cost to ratepayers would be more than $3.1 billion, the analysis found.

The report also considers a number of aging plants that are not yet scheduled for retirement. It finds Trump’s actions could create a “perverse incentive,” causing plant owners to claim they’re planning to shut down, inducing the feds to step in and keep them open, with the cost borne by ratepayers.

Accounting for that possibility, the report found that ratepayer costs could reach $5.9 billion per year to keep the entire aging fossil fuel fleet online. California, Texas and Colorado would see the highest increases in electricity bills.",https://thumb.spokesman.com/Fn4FQ5DB9L1Q52mR-7vCOt6MKDU=/1200x630/smart/media.spokesman.com/photos/2025/08/25/68aca40fedf0b.hires.jpg,N,,2025-08-25 17:03:24.764072

It’s no secret that advanced manufacturing and other industrial facilities require significant amounts of low-cost, reliable electricity. These sectors use more than one-third of the nation’s energy to produce the products and goods that make America the world’s leading economy. And that energy usage is projected to grow by 36 gigawatts (GW) by 2030 — the amount of electricity needed to power more than 25 million homes.

Bringing that power online efficiently will require significant but cost-effective upgrades to the nation’s transmission infrastructure. That means new high-voltage regional and interregional lines, as well as the deployment of advanced transmission technologies (ATTs) to maximize the use of the existing grid infrastructure.

Notably, the administration recently called for the deployment of all these transmission solutions. Interregional transmission lines would “reduce price differentials across regions by letting power flow where it is most needed, lowering production costs and increasing resiliency,"" the White House Council of Economic Advisers recently stated. That same month, the White House touted the need to “enhance the efficiency and performance of the transmission system” using advanced grid management technologies and line upgrades, according to the AI Action Plan.

Without an expansion of the transmission network, growth in electricity demand from new manufacturing plants and other large users of electricity could strain the grid and increase the risk of power outages. Manufacturers don’t take this risk lightly; outages at large facilities can cause safety issues and supply chain disruptions with long-lasting effects on their businesses and the global economy.

In addition to maintaining grid reliability, expanding transmission capacity would help keep prices affordable for consumers across the country. Well-planned transmission expansion, rather than piecemeal upgrades, can save consumers on their energy bills for decades to come.

Fortunately, state utility commissioners and regional grid operators have solutions that can quickly add grid capacity to help meet demand growth. ATTs – which include grid-enhancing technologies and high-performance conductors – are quick-to-deploy infrastructure, hardware, and software options that cost-effectively add capacity to the existing system. During this year’s legislative session, at least ten states passed laws requiring the consideration or deployment of ATTs, with similar bills still under consideration in several other states. State utility regulators in states that passed ATT bills will soon have an opportunity to ensure their local utilities are optimizing their grids.

To keep costs down for all customers in the longer term, state regulators, regional grid planners, and utilities can work together to plan efficient, high-voltage regional lines. Large-scale regional lines help keep costs down by transporting the lowest-cost electrons from power plants across the region and are often more cost-effective than local upgrades. The Great Plains, Midwest, and Texas grid operators approved regional transmission expansion plans in recent years, showcasing how better regional transmission planning is possible in every region across the country.

Interregional transmission lines are another longer-term solution for cost-effectively upgrading the grid. The Great Plains and Midwest grid operators recently approved new lines through a first-of-its-kind planning process which will help the two regions cost-effectively share power. While the agreed-upon lines are a good first step, more interregional lines are needed.

Additionally, policymakers have an opportunity to streamline the nation’s antiquated permitting processes this fall. As Congress gears up for permitting reform discussions next month, lawmakers must ensure legislative changes represent sensible reforms that will accelerate the buildout of the transmission and generation needed to power our growing industry.

Manufacturing and energy have always had a reciprocal relationship, but we’re now entering a new era — one in which American manufacturing and energy dominance are intertwined as an economic imperative. U.S. manufacturers are investing in America, and we must now invest in the infrastructure the industry needs to thrive.

President Donald Trump’s leadership is opening new opportunities, but more work is needed to ensure we have the power and regulatory frameworks needed to bring his vision to fruition.

With major changes, new deadlines, and stricter enforcement underway, businesses must prepare now—or risk violations, inquiries, and penalties.

Carbon Accounting Changed forever in 2022. The Clean Air Act expanded to include ALL companies to report their Air Emissions to EPA in 2026. Major Changes are continuing to accelerate on Emissions Air Reporting. Is your company prepared for current reporting requirements due in March 2026? Is your company reporting to a 3rd party framework? What risks is your company taking with regard to EPA reporting that may create inquiries by the EPA about your emissions reporting?

In the first two quarters of 2025 EPA announced, Sunsetting Energy Star Portfilio Manager, and the US Environmentally Extended Input-Output model (USEEIO) used for Scope 3 Supply Chain or Value Chain Carbon Reporting. Calafornia Air Resource Board (CARB) has issued their answers to Freaquently Asked Questions (FAQ’s) defining the size of a company footprint in Calafornia that will have to report their emissions to CARB in 2026.

In the 3rd Quarter of 2025 EPA has started to issue Request for Information (RFI) to existing reporting companies that currently report their emissions to EPA but offer different emission numbers to 3rd Party frameworks such as i.e.: Corporate Greenhouse Gas Initiative (Corporate GHG), Science Based Target initiative (SBTi), Global Real Estate Sustainablity Benchmark (GRESB), Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP), etc..

Are you Ready to Report your Emissions to the EPA between January 1, 2026 and March 31, 2026?

In 2022 Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022, included in the IRA is a section that requires the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to expand and enforce the Clean Air Act. This expansion includes all companies, and pulls in industries that have not had to Measure, Calculate, and Report their Air Emissions previously to the EPA. Industry examples are: Real Estate, software companies, social media companies, law firms, accounting firms, design firms, retail and internet retail companies, food and clothing manufactures, distribution and logistic companies, etc..

What do you know about emissions reporting?

No 3rd party reporting framework is recognized by regulatory bodies for emissions reporting.

Corporate Greenhouse Gas Protocol or Initiative now retitled a Standard (Self Proclaimed) also know as Corporate GHG or GHG is the largest of the 3rd party reporting frameworks in use by corporations. Which allows the company to place or push their emissions into indirect emissions, and miscalculate the companies emissions.

Lets review two simple examples where Corporate GHG is incorrect:

Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) owns an Office Building with multiple tenants, Corporate GHG allows the REIT to only calculate and report the emissions for the utility meters billed to the building (owned and or controlled), the tenant utility meters are not reported and listed as indirect or Scope 3 Emissions. That is incorrect. Regulatory Reporting for the office building requires the Building Owner or Manager to Report the entire emissions of the building which are common areas plus tenant utility meters, exterior lighting and or parking lighting.

The same office building listed in 1) above supplies Hot Water and Chilled Water to the Tenants and common spaces in the building for heating and cooling allowing the tenants to control the space conditioning.

Scope 1 fixed fuel equipment (Natural Gas Fired in our example) Corporate GHG is missing 4 important Items: 1) Natural Gas Analysis (Methane is usually only 50.5% the remaining gas is made up of other flammable gases and fossel C02), 2) Equipment efficiency is missing Corporate GHG assumes 100% efficient equipment which is incorrect, 3) Flue Gas Analysis which provides two items, exact listing and quantity of emissions, and natural gas burner efficiency, 4) All Fuels have a Carbon Intensity (CI) which is included in calculating the Fuels Carbon Emissions when used, Carbon Intensity is the extraction, processing/refining, transportation, and distribution losses on the way to the final customer in our case the office building.

Scope 2 Purchased Energy ALL purchased energy has transmission and distribution losses, Electricity has Line Losses. Transmission and Distribution Losses as well as line losses are included in Scope 2 Emissions, Corporate GHG Assigns T&D, and Line Losses to Scope 3 which is incorrect. Corporate GHG also looks at the United States Grid as one Electricity Grid that is wrong it is a set of small grids called e grids and CO2e is calculated based on the local grid or e grid.

Scope 3 Corporate GHG is full of measurements not reflecting EPA standards and indirect emissions that need to be included in a company’s carbon accounting, US EPAs CO2e/USD Spend is an estimate that is modeled using the EPAs Environmentally Extended Input-Output Model, which is no longer supported.

With ALL Companies Required to Report their Emissions to EPA in 2026 you should be asking your supply chain about their Mandatory Reporting Requirements which are also due in 2026. That information will give your company a great insight into how to handel your Scope 3 Emission Reporting which will be required reporting to EPA in 2028.

Reduction Claims, Carbon Neutrality, and Net Zero Emissions Claims. Are your Claims Correct?

Reduction Claims – the most common mistakes we see in reduction claims are:

The Environmental Attribute (Renewable Energy Certificate or Credit, Renewable Index Number or Carbon Offset or Credit) being retired is not retired in the facilities name.

The Environmental Attribute is not traceable or traceable on a specific market or to a specific project, i.e. “from our retired stock of…” means the most a company could say is they are supporting that environmental attribute. This is also referred to as the “secondary” or “voluntary” market and would not pass the test of regulatory scrutiny or attestation review.

Renewable Energy Certificates or Credits and Renewable Index Numbers or Biofuels have no Carbon Intensity or Carbon Score is incorrect. They have a carbon footprint and are calculated for regulatory emissions reporting, tracking and tracing.

Carbon Neutrality and Net Zero Emissions

Both terms are universally applied in a “general or generic terms” and they are not:

Both terms break down into:

Operational which covers the annual emissions for the year.

US DOE issued a definition of Carbon Neutral Operations as an all-electric facility with no connection to any fossil fuels and using 100% renewable energy.

True Definitions of both terms also include the facilities and their build carbon emissions and land use changes and loss of the natural carbon sink that existed on the site of the facility.

With this overview do you feel that your current Carbon Accounting is correct?

Fort Polk’s solar installation is part of the Army’s goals to cut utility costs and increase resiliency, and more notably its Army Climate Strategy.
Along with the solar installation, Fort Polk is installing more than 3,600 ground-source heat pumps at Fort Polk’s homes, office space and neighborhood centers.
This makes access to the reliability that comes with onsite solar, energy storage and microgrids vital to the Army.
Earlier this year, Corvias and Onyx completed the third phase of another U.S. Army solar project in Kansas.","To the U.S. Army, climate change is more than real. To the U.S. Army, climate change can be described as a ‘”threat multiplier” that “poses an immediate and serious national security threat.”

The Army said it cannot address all or even most greenhouse gas emissions, but with its effects already affecting its ability to conduct missions, the Army pumped out a solar project for another military installation, this time with a 13 MW solar project at Fort Polk (formerly Fort Johnson) in Louisiana.

Fort Polk’s solar installation is part of the Army’s goals to cut utility costs and increase resiliency, and more notably its Army Climate Strategy.

“This installation has always been about readiness, not just on the battlefield, but in every aspect of Soldier and family life,” Brig. Gen. Jason A. Curl said.

Along with the solar installation, Fort Polk is installing more than 3,600 ground-source heat pumps at Fort Polk’s homes, office space and neighborhood centers. The upgrades are expected to reduce electricity use by 31%, or 12,794 MWh per year, saving nearly $40 million. The efficiency project also benefited from the maximum 50% federal investment tax credit for ground-source heat pumps.

(See also: How the One Big Beautiful Bill affects heat pump adoption)

The project will supply enough electricity to power 1,800 military homes at Fort Polk – about 42% of the installation’s 3,661 homes. The solar projects are expected to provide 42% of the base’s electricity demand for on-base housing in their first year, according to Onyx.

The project will provide energy cost savings over a 25-year power purchase agreement, which enables solar projects to deliver stable and low electric rates.

Corvias said it plans to expand the new installation by an additional 15 MW to 18 MW during its next phase, aiming to use 100% renewable energy for the fort’s housing.

It also plans to add microgrid technology, residential and commercial-scale battery energy storage systems, and electric vehicle supply equipment for electric vehicles in the future. Corvias said these advancements will not only support current missions but also future-proof the installation against evolving climate threats.

“When tackling energy security, it is imperative to reduce the consumption of all utilities and to not be vulnerable to third-party power failures,” Corvias said.

This makes access to the reliability that comes with onsite solar, energy storage and microgrids vital to the Army.

Curl said the solar project “provides greater independence and resilience to our families to have reliable power, no matter what the challenge.”

The project was developed through a partnership Corvias and Onyx Renewables established in 2015 with the goal of providing clean energy to military communities. Corvias is about 20 years in to a 50-year partnership with the U.S. Military under the Department of Defense’s Military Housing Privatization Initiative program.

The 13-Mw project consists of more than 30,000 solar panels on one parcel of land spanning 97 acres. Onyx, which will finance, own and operate the systems long term, said the solar arrays are scheduled for energization this fall.

Chris Wilson, chief executive officer, Corvias, said the renewable energy efforts are a reflection of the important role energy resilience plays in national security. “By enhancing the energy infrastructure of military installations, we are helping to meet tomorrow’s defense needs.”

The Fort Polk solar project is part of the Army’s transition to use 100% carbon pollution-free electricity at all its installations by 2030. One of the Army’s resiliency goals is to install a microgrid on every installation by 2035. These will include renewable generation and large-scale battery storage, with the goal being able to “self-sustain its critical missions” on all Army installations by 2040. In addition, the Army aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by half from its buildings by 2032, compared to 2005. Part of the plan is for light-duty non-tactical vehicles to be all-electric by 2027, and all non-tactical vehicles would be electric vehicles by 2035.

The U.S. Army said climate change makes it challenging to serve its core purpose. According to the Department of Defense (DoD), natural disasters and extreme weather events caused by climate change has caused $13 billion in damages to DoD bases.

Corvias said other Department of Defense installations can replicate Fort Polk’s success if the private sector and other army groups collaborate more, which will close resilience gaps, accelerate project timelines and adopt modern business models that facilitate innovative solutions. This approach reduces project costs while ebnabling long-term maintenance, Corvias said.

Corvias said it has invested over $60 million in Fort Polk’s energy projects: $33 million in the energy efficiency upgrades and $29.2 million in the solar project.

Additionally, Corvias said it has infused more than $360 million into the rural Fort Polk economy. Overall, the total development cost is an estimated $1.2 billion and have a $5.1 billion total local economic impact, according to Corvias.

Along with the financial impact on Louisiana, Curl said the solar project strengthens Fort Polk, supports its soldiers and families, and ensures that the installation remains the standard for innovation and resiliency for the U.S. Army.

Earlier this year, Corvias and Onyx completed the third phase of another U.S. Army solar project in Kansas. The 4.23 MW phase brought the Fort Riley base’s total solar capacity to more than 16 MW, becoming one of the largest renewable energy projects in Kansas.

Fort Riley’s solar project includes both rooftop installations on more than 1,600 homes on the base, which were completed during the project’s first two phases in 2018 and 2021, and ground-mounted solar arrays, completed in the third phase this year.

The project’s third phase was initially planned to be the final phase, but Onyx Renewables told pv magazine USA, they are evaluating an additional phase, but it is still early in development and diligence.

The U.S. Army also worked with Onyx Renewables for two 6.5 MW projects at its Fort Johnson base in Louisiana, which began late last year.

Jessica Kutz reports for The 19th.

In short:

Davis’s hometown of Prichard has suffered decades of water infrastructure neglect, with over 50 million gallons of raw sewage spilled since 2021 and elevated levels of cancer-linked chemicals detected in drinking water.

Under the Biden administration, Davis helped secure federal grants and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency support, but all efforts were halted after President Trump eliminated environmental justice programs and rescinded pending grants.

Now running for mayor, Davis hopes to use her platform to restore local accountability, fight utility mismanagement, and oppose a takeover of the city’s water system by a neighboring utility.

Key quote:

""I believe that if we cannot get relief from the administration then we need to go to Congress, and we need to go to federal court in order to get the relief that is necessary. The mayor has to be willing to pull all of those levers.""

— Carletta Davis, mayoral candidate for Prichard, Alabama

Why this matters:

Aging, failing water systems are threatening public health across the U.S., especially in poor and predominantly Black communities like Prichard. Residents face contaminated tap water, sky-high utility bills, and chronic sewage overflows — conditions that fuel disease risk and economic instability.

IRS makes it harder for wind and solar projects to claim tax breaks

The New York Times – August 15

The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) on August 15 issued new rules that would restrict the ability of wind and solar companies to claim federal tax credits, a move that could hinder numerous renewable energy projects under development. The Administration’s domestic policy bill, which was signed into law on July 4, was already set to rapidly phase out existing tax credits for new wind and solar farms unless they began construction in the next 12 months. The new IRS guidance would add further hurdles by tightening longstanding rules for what counts as the “beginning of construction,” which will make it harder for some projects to qualify before the tax credits expire.

Solar may account for half of new U.S. electricity added this year, EIA says

Reuters – August 20

Developers are on track to add 33 GW of solar power in the U.S. this year, accounting for about half of the total new electricity generating capacity planned for the country in 2025, the Energy Information Administration (EIA) announced on August 20. If the plans are realized, large-scale solar power additions in the U.S. would reach a record high, said the EIA, which based its analysis on a survey of developers. Many of the federal government financial incentives that propelled the development of solar power over the last several years, however, will disappear under the current Administration.

Clean energy groups challenge DOE grid reliability report

Utility Dive – August 18

A July report in which the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) warned of widespread blackouts if coal and gas plants are allowed to retire “falls far short of a serious assessment of reliability and resource adequacy,” three clean energy organizations said in a formal rehearing request filed on August 6. At least one federal agency — the Department of the Interior — has already cited the DOE resource adequacy protocol in an official action. It referred to the protocol in an Aug. 1 order that staff consider the capacity density of energy projects proposed on federal lands, singling out wind and solar as “inefficient.”

New Jersey, Atlantic Shores terminate OREC contract for 1.5 GW offshore wind project

OffshoreWind – August 19

The New Jersey Board of Public Utilities has vacated the offshore renewable energy certificate (OREC) order issued in 2021, which approved the 1,509.6 MW Atlantic Shores Project 1 as a Qualified Offshore Wind Project, as per the request recently filed by the developer. Atlantic Shores Offshore Wind, a joint venture between EDF Renewables and Shell, which Shell paused its involvement in at the beginning of 2025, submitted a request to terminate its OREC contract in June, citing the recent withdrawal of the project’s Air Permit for further review as one of the key reasons.

The report — published by the Center for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA), a Finland-based independent air-quality research organization; and Global Energy Monitor (GEM), a US-based energy analytics company — says China put 21 gigawatts (GW) of coal power online in the first six months of 2025.

That is the highest six-month level in nine years. The CREA/GEM report also cites new construction and re-firing of existing coal plants totaling 46 GW and proposed projects with the capacity to produce a further 75 GW.

Total projected coal plant output is forecast to hit between 80-100 GW in 2025.

Coal currently accounts for half of China's energy production, down from three-quarters in 2016.

China, the world's second-largest economy, is also the world's largest greenhouse gas emitter.

China installing enormous amounts of renewables, sinking overall emissions

Paradoxically, this spike in coal use takes place as China massively expands its renewable capacity, which now covers growth in electricity demand. Solar capacity, for instance, jumped by 212 GW in the first six months of 2025.

This year alone, the country is on track to install enough new renewable energy to cover the energy needs of Germany and the UK combined.

Germany, according to its Federal Network Agency, added roughly 20 GW of renewables to its grid in 2024, bringing its total to 190. China will add 500 GW in new wind and solar power in 2025 alone.

Beijing's push has led to a 1% drop in six-month emissions year-on-year, according to the UK-based climate and energy website Carbon Brief, yet China's increased reliance on coal threatens to derail its pursuit of gas emissions reductions.

""Despite a rapidly changing capacity and generation mix, coal power construction in China shows no sign of easing,"" wrote CREA.

""Coal power development in China... shows no sign of easing, leaving emissions on a high plateau and stranding coal in the system for years to come,"" echoed Christine Shearer, research analyst at GEM and co-author of the report.

China's 'powerful coal interests' threaten climate goals

In 2021, Chinese President Xi Jinping said he would ""strictly control"" the coal industry in order to ""phase it down"" between 2026 and 2030.

Despite Xi's pledge to remove 30 GW of coal from China's grids between 2020 and the end of 2025, only 1 GW has been taken offline.

CREA authors cite ""powerful coal interests"" in warning that these are crowding out renewables by securing ""long-term contracts and broad capacity payments,"" allowing them to ""keep many plants running at high output.""

Xi has said he will announce China's Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) — a national commitment to greenhouse gas emissions reductions by 2035 — before November's COP30 climate summit in Brazil.

Details are also expected when the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) releases the details of its 15th Five-Year Plan for 2026 to 2030 in the coming months.

Congresswoman Jennifer McClellan (VA-04) recently joined clean energy advocates in warning that recent Republican-backed proposals undermining clean energy will increase household energy costs and weaken Virginia’s transition to a cleaner, more affordable energy future.

During a Richmond press briefing, McClellan reiterated concern for increases in electricity bills nationwide. Recent data indicates that the average monthly residential electricity bill rose from $122 in 2021, to $144 in 2024. This made the advocates argue that repealing clean energy tax credits and cutting federal investments would make things worse by stalling renewable energy projects that help lower costs and create jobs in the commonwealth.

Budget measures introduced by Republicans earlier this year sought to reclaim $6.5 billion in unspent Inflation Reduction Act funds and roll back incentives for clean vehicles, renewable projects, and environmental justice programs, a move critics say will jeopardize long-term affordability while increasing dependence on fossil fuels.

McClellan and the clean energy advocates echoed that the issue is both an economic and environmental threat, noting that scaling back renewable programs will not only increase pollution and public health risks but also deter private investment in clean technology in addition to burdening families already struggling with rising utility costs.

“Families are already feeling the pinch of higher electricity bills. Instead of working to lower costs, Republicans are pushing policies that will take us backward, making energy more expensive and undermining the clean energy future we need,” said McClellan.

Energy industry leaders also shared their concern, warning that eliminating clean energy incentives is not a good idea at a time when energy demand is surging, particularly due to new data and AI infrastructure. Such a move would put running projects and jobs at risk.

If true reallocation does not occur, then EPA is effectively reducing the already low RFS blending levels for 2025.

It is critical, however, that the renewable fuel blending volumes associated with SREs for 2023 and 2024 are fully reallocated.","On Friday, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued decisions involving 175 petitions for small refinery exemptions (SREs) from the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) for 2016–2024.

EPA granted full exemptions to 63 petitions and partial exemptions to 77 petitions. The rest were denied or deemed ineligible.

Farm and biofuel groups were quick to react to this step by the agency. Most were pleased by the move and all called for further action. Here’s a closer look.

American Farm Bureau Federation

The American Farm Bureau Federation (AFBF) is the nation’s largest farmer-run organization and serves farmers in all 50 states.

On Friday, AFBF President Zippy Duvall commented on the announcement.

“Renewable fuels have been a tremendous success story for the country and the rural economy. The RFS has reduced our country’s dependence on foreign oil, reduced air pollution, increased farm income, and provided good-paying jobs in rural America.

“Farmers rely on a robust renewable fuel standard with strong renewable volume obligations that further build the biofuels market. EPA’s measured approach will prevent overuse of small refinery exemptions that would risk undermining the RFS and the biofuels market for farmers.

“With the proposed RFS rule increasing domestic fuel production and prioritizing home-grown crops, we urge EPA to build on this momentum in its reallocation guidance by ensuring the volume lost to exemptions is replaced. Supporting a robust biofuels market allows our country to reduce fuel prices and move closer to energy independence.”

Growth Energy

As the nation’s largest biofuel trade association, Growth Energy is the leading voice of America’s biofuel industry. Members of the association operate and support biomanufacturing facilities at the heart of America’s bioeconomy, delivering a new generation of plant-based energy and climate solutions.

The association published a statement Friday in response to EPA’s announcement.

“With more than 140 granted refinery exemptions, today’s [SRE] decision alone does not give farmers and biofuel producers the certainty they need,” said Growth Energy CEO Emily Skor. “It is imperative that EPA reallocates each and every exempt gallon in a forthcoming rule to mitigate the potentially devastating impact on biofuel demand. We appreciate EPA’s commitment to issue a rule that ensures promised homegrown biofuel gallons reach the marketplace and upholds the administration’s commitment to American energy dominance.”

Iowa Renewable Fuels Association

Formed in 2002, the Iowa Renewable Fuels Association (IRFA) brings together Iowa ethanol and biodiesel producers to foster the development and growth of the state’s biofuels industry through education, promotion, and infrastructure development.

On Friday, IRFA released a statement applauding the move by EPA.

“We must get RFS refinery waiver uncertainty out of the market, and today’s action by EPA takes a big step forward,” said IRFA Executive Director Monte Shaw. “While we can quibble with the justification of the SREs granted, the EPA was spot-on in reissuing the same retired RFS credits back to the refiners who received an exemption. This is consistent with past actions when the shoe was on the other foot and is in line with the overall goals of the RFS.”

“One absolutely vital question remains: how or if the SREs from 2023–2025 will be reallocated,” Shaw continued. “That is a 2-billion-gallon uncertainty hanging over the market and the pending RFS blending rule for 2026 and 2027.”

“Full and complete reallocation of the 2023 and newer SREs is the vital point,” stated Shaw. “In the end, that will determine whether the EPA upholds President Trump’s commitment to the RFS and to American farmers. If true reallocation does not occur, then EPA is effectively reducing the already low RFS blending levels for 2025. IRFA was heartened by EPA’s announcement today that it will propose reallocating the exempted volumes. We now anxiously await EPA’s reallocation proposal, at which time we will be commenting in the strongest possible terms that reallocation of every SRE gallon must occur, and we will implore the EPA to end the SRE uncertainty before finalizing the 2026/2027 RFS rule.”

National Corn Growers Association

Founded in 1957, the National Corn Growers Association (NCGA) represents more than 36,000 dues-paying corn growers in 48 states, and the interests of more than 300,000 farmers who contribute through corn checkoff programs in their state.

After EPA’s announcement Friday, Illinois farmer and NCGA President Kenneth Hartman Jr. released a statement, calling the announcement an “important step toward resolving a stubborn issue that has lingered without resolution for too many years.”

“With government reports projecting record high corn yields this year, we continue to focus on corn demand, including increasing ethanol sales,” Hartman said. “We want to see the RFS continue to be implemented as it was intended, and we want to extend year-round, nationwide consumer access to 15% ethanol fuel blends through the summer months. Both will ensure greater energy security and lower gas prices for consumers.”

Renewable Fuels Association

Since 1981, the Renewable Fuels Association (RFA) has been the leading trade association for America’s ethanol industry.

RFA President and CEO Geoff Cooper offered the following statement in response to the announcement:

“While RFA continues to doubt that the small refineries receiving exemptions today truly experienced ‘disproportionate economic hardship’ due to the RFS, we are pleased to see EPA taking an approach to implementation of these exemptions that is minimally disruptive to the marketplace and affirms the agency’s intent to reallocate renewable fuel volumes lost to SREs. We appreciate that EPA is focused on an approach that maintains stability in the marketplace and ensures finalized annual volumes under the RFS are maintained. The exemptions granted today should have little or no effect on current and future levels of renewable fuel production and use. It is critical, however, that the renewable fuel blending volumes associated with SREs for 2023 and 2024 are fully reallocated.

“In the days ahead, RFA will be further analyzing EPA’s new approach and rationale for determining disproportionate economic hardship. According to EPA’s previous analysis, all refiners — both small and large — recoup their RIN costs when they sell gasoline and diesel. Thus, there is no credible evidence that small refiners are disproportionately affected by RFS compliance, or that the financial impact of RFS compliance rises to a level anywhere close to ‘economic hardship.’ In any case, SREs were always intended to be a temporary measure and a bridge to compliance — not a permanent handout. Small refiners have now had two full decades to adapt their operations to comply with the RFS.”",https://www.agriculture.com/thmb/2sGCJ5P985yZW89EQzI97_6bIUo=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/54163679242_59f748f514_o-0de4af3a868e41c08311efbeff9d9d99.jpg,N,,2025-08-25 17:03:53.350050

The NESE project, proposed by Williams Transco, seeks to expand the Transco natural gas pipeline to carry fracked gas from Pennsylvania through New Jersey and under the NY/NJ Harbor. The project poses risks to sensitive marine ecosystems and stands in direct conflict with New York’s Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act of 2019, which mandates a 40% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and an 85% reduction by 2050, compared to 1990 levels.

The NESE pipeline would endanger sensitive marine ecosystems, expose New Yorkers to toxic contaminants, and lock our state into decades of fossil fuel dependence. At a moment when we should be investing in clean energy infrastructure, this project moves us backward and places environmental justice communities at greatest risk.

The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC) previously rejected a key permit for the project in 2020 after finding that pipeline construction would likely unearth and release harmful contaminants, including mercury, lead, arsenic, and PCBs, into New York Harbor. These toxins threaten marine life such as whales, seals, and dolphins that have recently begun to return to the city’s waterways and also pose serious human health risks.

The conference brought together thought leaders, innovators, policymakers, researchers, and advocates from across the renewable energy community to share ideas, inspire innovation, and build momentum for the clean energy transformation.

This year's theme, ""Innovation for Universal Renewable Energy Access,"" set the stage for conversations on climate resilience, energy justice, and the technologies driving us toward a more sustainable future. Attendees arrived curious at the state of the industry given recent federal changes, and went away feeling that solar is here to stay. The industry is strong enough to persist without federal subsidies and still requires support at the local and state levels. Attendees engaged in dynamic sessions, expanded interactive poster sessions, hands-on workshops, ASES' first-ever career fair, and networking opportunities that fostered collaboration across sectors.

Throughout the conference, several recurring themes emerged, underscoring the breadth and urgency of today's renewable energy transformation. Presentations and discussions highlighted the growing importance of policies that ensure equitable access to energy, particularly for low-income families and communities. Innovations in agrivoltaics, including approaches that integrate solar with crops, livestock, and natural habitats, showed how solar can enhance rather than compete with agricultural and ecological systems. Building-integrated solar and grid advancements demonstrated how renewable energy is shaping both our infrastructure and our daily lives. Sessions also explored tipping points for solar, wind, and batteries, as well as the global forces driving the transition--policy and geopolitics, climate and sustainability risks, artificial intelligence, energy transition financing, critical minerals competition, and the rapid growth of cleantech industries.

The conference concluded with a call to action: governments, companies, and the general public must work together to embed transparency, inclusiveness, and good governance into every level of the renewable energy sector. This includes policy frameworks, procurement processes, investment practices, and community advocacy.

Rhode Island is already home to one offshore wind farm in state waters, the five-turbine Block Island Wind Farm.
The Trump administration previously stopped work on Empire Wind, the New York offshore wind project.","A nearly complete wind farm off the coast of Rhode Island and Connecticut faces an uncertain future as the states' Democratic governors, members of Congress and union workers are calling Monday for the Trump administration to let construction resume.

The administration halted construction on the Revolution Wind project last week, saying the federal government needs to review the project and address national security concerns. It did not specify what those concerns are. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management said Monday it's not commenting further at this time.

The Democratic politicians are getting involved because stopping work on Revolution Wind threatens local jobs and their states' climate goals, and could drive up electricity prices throughout the region. Officials say the project is 80% complete, with all the underwater foundations and 45 out of 65 turbines already installed.

Large, ocean-based wind farms are the linchpin of government plans to shift to renewable energy, particularly in East Coast states with large populations and limited land for wind turbines or solar arrays.

President Donald Trump has made sweeping strides to prioritize fossil fuels and hinder renewable energy projects. Those include reviewing wind and solar energy permits, canceling plans to use large areas of federal waters for new offshore wind development and stopping work on another offshore wind project under construction for New York, although construction was later allowed to resume.

Rhode Island Gov. Dan McKee is headed to North Kingstown, where the logistics and operations hub for the project is located. The governor has said the wind farm is critical to the region’s economy and energy future. Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont spoke at State Pier in New London, where components for the Revolution Wind project are kept before being taken out to sea.

U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut said during Monday's press conference that it was “nuts, crazy, insane” to halt a fully approved project that would save ratepayers hundreds of millions of dollars. He expects the courts to agree that the Trump administration acted unlawfully when it stopped the project based on “secret information.”

Revolution Wind is expected to be Rhode Island and Connecticut’s first large offshore wind farm, capable of powering more than 350,000 homes. Power would be provided at a rate of 9.8 cents per kilowatt hour, locked in for 20 years. That is cheaper than the average cost of electricity in New England.

About 1,000 union members have been working on Revolution Wind, and those jobs are now at risk.

“This isn’t work that anybody can do,” Keith Brothers, business manager of the Connecticut Laborers’ District Council, said about the specialized skills the workers on this project have. “We’ve taken people from the military, we’ve placed them on jobs on this specific site, that’s important.”

A statement from North America’s Building Trades Unions was more direct: “President Donald Trump just fired 1,000 of our members.”

The developer, Danish energy company Orsted, is evaluating the financial impact of stopping construction and considering legal proceedings.

The project site is more than 15 miles (24 kilometers) south of the Rhode Island coast, 32 miles (51 kilometers) southeast of the Connecticut coast and 12 miles (19 kilometers) southwest of Martha’s Vineyard. Rhode Island is already home to one offshore wind farm in state waters, the five-turbine Block Island Wind Farm.

The Trump administration previously stopped work on Empire Wind, the New York offshore wind project. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said it appeared former President Joe Biden’s administration had “rushed through” the approvals, although the developer Equinor spent seven years obtaining permits. Construction was allowed to resume in May after two of the state's Democratic leaders, U.S. Sen. Chuck Schumer and Gov. Kathy Hochul, intervened.

If you’re only a casual automotive industry observer, you’d be forgiven for believing that the electric vehicle (and everything associated with it) is effectively dead. But despite some very real financial headwinds, progress marches on, and according to J.D. Power, America is steadily improving both charger availability and reliability—and the latter is largely thanks to Tesla.

Certainly, the administration and Congress moved swiftly to gut funding for National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) programs, but with local and state governments stepping up to help cover those shortfalls, few of them are truly dead in the water. Customers’ biggest complaints in 2025 were related to charging costs and issues with the payment process, resulting in a 10-point slide in overall satisfaction. However, customers also reported noticeable improvements in charger reliability, marked by fewer users “failing to charge” after arriving at a station.

“In the absence of NEVI funding, the industry is experiencing a concerted effort among various stakeholders in the EV ecosystem—particularly from automakers and charging networks—to improve the public charging experience for customers,” J.D. Power EV expert Brent Gruber said in the company’s report.

“With or without the federal funding, NEVI guidelines have made their mark by establishing a playbook for industry success,” Gruber added. “While overall satisfaction scores decline this year, our data shows clear improvement in the reliability and success of public charging—a promising sign of progress for the industry. As part of its analysis, J.D. Power also monitors public charging performance across the country by measuring failed charging attempts and availability, as well as providing critical data on where the customer experience is improving and where challenges remain.”

Say what you will about the company and its current leadership, but Tesla’s Supercharger network remains the gold standard for fast-charging experiences in the United States. That advantage comes less from any sort of technological or service-level superiority, but rather the advantage of being built to cater to a single manufacturer. Tesla and Red E were the only two to beat the industry average.

“Tesla’s Supercharger network continues to lead the DC fast charger (DCFC) segment in customer satisfaction with a score of 709, despite a 22-point decline from last year. However, non-Tesla automaker-operated networks—including the Mercedes-Benz Charging Network, Rivian Adventure Network, and Ford Charge—collectively earn a satisfaction score of 709, on par with Tesla,” the report said. “These networks were not eligible for rank consideration in this year’s study due to their limited footprint, but early performance suggests manufacturers are successfully applying lessons from Tesla’s brand-level ecosystem.”

Charging networks intended to be used by virtually any EV were consistently rated lowest, with Blink coming in dead last behind EVgo and Electrify America in both fast-charging and level 2 setups.

Contributing Writer

(Veritenews.org) — State regulators on last Wednesday (Aug. 20) authorized a controversial plan to power a massive Meta-owned data facility in northeast Louisiana – a project poised to become one of the largest artificial intelligence centers in the world.

The decision by the Louisiana Public Service Commission paves the way for Entergy to build three gas-fired power plants, transmission lines and other infrastructure serving the $10 billion center, which Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, plans to develop on farmland east of Monroe in rural Richland Parish.

While concerns have been raised about the potential for higher power bills and impacts to air and water, most commissioners said the center will be an economic boon for an area with few jobs and a declining population.

“I’m for it 1,000%,” said Foster Campbell, a Democrat who represents north Louisiana on the commission. “Let’s give the people of northeast Louisiana some hope.”

The commission voted 4-1 in favor of the energy plan at their meeting in Plaquemine, which drew about 150 attendees in the audience. The commission had been expected to consider the plan in October but was urged by Entergy to expedite the process.

Commissioner Davante Lewis, a Democrat whose district includes much of New Orleans and Baton Rouge, voted against the plan. Lewis has repeatedly raised concerns about the project since it was announced last year, but his stance has softened in recent weeks.

“The current plan is a significant improvement from what was originally proposed,” he said, highlighting consumer protections that put the burden of rising energy costs back on Meta.

“If there are overruns, Meta will eat the costs,” he said.

Still, he and some other Louisiana residents who spoke at the meeting worry about the project’s reliance on gas power plants, which contribute to climate change through greenhouse gas emissions, and the volatility of the gas market. Louisiana lacks large-scale renewable energy sources that could be tapped to offset rising gas prices, Lewis said.

“In Texas, if gas goes up, they can use solar and wind,” he said. “In Louisiana, we have no [energy] load flexibility.”

Some residents said Entergy has a poor record of reliability and often pushes infrastructure costs on ratepayers.

“Entergy can’t keep the lights on on a good day,” Thibodaux resident Logan Wolf said. “I don’t believe they’ll be able to power this grid. I don’t believe them when they say ratepayers won’t pay more.”

The large amounts of water that data centers need to cool computers sometimes tax local water supplies, but Meta has indicated the proposed center will use less water than the farm it will replace.

The plan calls for the construction of three gas plants with a combined capacity of nearly 2,300 megawatts. Two plants would be built in Richland Parish, and a third would likely be located somewhere in south Louisiana. Other infrastructure would include eight substations and about 100 miles of high-capacity transmission lines.

At about 4 million square feet, the facility will be nearly the size of Vatican City and could rank as one of the world’s five biggest data centers by the time it’s completed after 2030.

The project is expected to generate about 500 new jobs, more than 1,000 indirect jobs and employ around 5,000 construction workers, according to Louisiana Economic Development.

The mere prospect of such a project has already sparked economic activity in north Louisiana, said Rob Cleveland, CEO of Grow Northeast Louisiana, an economic development group.

In recent months, several stores and restaurants “have experienced exponential growth,” and three large business projects have been proposed in the 10-parish region.

“All these projects are due to the attention brought by the Meta project,” Cleveland said.

Richland Parish has lost about 2,000 people since the 1980s and now has just under 20,000 residents. About a quarter of the population lives below the poverty line, according to Census data.

“This is something drastically needed in north Louisiana,” Campbell said. “It’s a shot in the arm.”

To address this, Apit mentioned the government has prepared an Industrial Decarbonization Roadmap.
Currently, the roadmap covers emissions from energy and industrial processes (IPPU), while the waste sector has not yet been mapped.
The implementation of the Industrial Decarbonization Roadmap will contribute to a reduction of 68 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions by 2035 and 291 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions by 2050.
“Although the road ahead is long, Indonesia’s industrial decarbonization roadmap to 2050 offers hope.","Jakarta, August 21, 2025 – Industry is one of the backbones of the national economy. According to the latest Statistics Indonesia (BPS) data, the industrial sector contributes 18.9% to national GDP, employs 19.3 million workers, and attracts foreign investment worth IDR 80,538 trillion. Furthermore, 34% of national emissions come from industrial activities, with 36% of these emissions coming from high-energy industries such as cement, iron and steel, fertilizer, pulp and paper, textiles, glass and ceramics, food and beverages, and automotive. This was stated by Apit Pria Nugraha, Head of the Green Industry Center at the Indonesian Ministry of Industry, on the second day of 2nd AIGIS 2025 event on Thursday (21/8), which was also supported by the Institute for Essential Services Reform (IESR).

“These nine high-energy-intensive industrial sectors are prioritized for decarbonization. We have this decarbonization target to realize a competitive national industry operating with net-zero emissions by 2050 and to establish a green industrial ecosystem. Of course, numerous supporting instruments must be prepared, starting from the supply of energy, materials, and low-carbon technology, which must be affordable and reliable. There also needs to be a funding mechanism with diverse and easily accessible incentives, as well as a regulatory framework,” Apit emphasized.

To address this, Apit mentioned the government has prepared an Industrial Decarbonization Roadmap. However, this roadmap is still a living document, meaning it will be continuously updated as data and technology develop. Currently, the roadmap covers emissions from energy and industrial processes (IPPU), while the waste sector has not yet been mapped.

“This roadmap has two main outputs: a technical report containing emission reduction trajectories, decarbonization strategies, investment needs, impacts on product prices, and energy and material requirements; and a policy report containing an analysis of regulatory, funding, and technology gaps to support decarbonization,” said Apit.

Apit added that the official roadmap document will be launched in September 2025, followed by a policy report in March 2026, and supporting regulations in the form of a Ministerial Regulation of Industry in June 2026. Subsequently, regulations per subsector will be issued in stages starting in September 2026.

Apit emphasized that based on its emission profile, 46% of emissions in the manufacturing industry come from directly generated energy, 16% from purchased electricity, and 38% from chemical processes in the production and product application (IPPU). The manufacturing industry produces more energy emissions, although the proportion is fairly balanced with IPPU emissions.

The implementation of the Industrial Decarbonization Roadmap will contribute to a reduction of 68 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions by 2035 and 291 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions by 2050.

To reduce emissions while maintaining industrial competitiveness, the government has established five pillars of the decarbonization strategy. First, increasing energy and material efficiency to reduce resource consumption. Second, replacing fuels and materials with cleaner alternatives, including renewable energy. Third, transforming production processes to use low-carbon technologies. Fourth, encouraging electrification and the use of renewable energy in manufacturing processes. Fifth, developing carbon sequestration technologies such as CCU, CCS, and CCUS to support long-term emission reductions. All of these approaches emphasize the importance of reducing emissions first, before ultimately neutralizing the remaining emissions with carbon sequestration technologies.

Meanwhile, Faricha Hidayati, Coordinator of the Industrial Decarbonization Program at IESR, stated that the biggest challenges of this entire strategy are the availability of technology, investment costs, and sufficient clean energy supply. Green hydrogen, for example, is only expected to be widely adopted by 2030 because its price is still high at present. Similarly, carbon capture and utilization (CCU/S) technology requires adequate infrastructure planning and regulatory certainty as soon as possible, although its utilization is expected to remain in the long term due to the high cost of emissions reduction (abatement) compared to other technologies.

“Although the road ahead is long, Indonesia’s industrial decarbonization roadmap to 2050 offers hope. Key sectors such as textiles, automotive, glass, ceramics, cooking oil, and sugar can contribute significantly to reducing emissions if technological, electrification, and fuel-switching measures are implemented consistently. The key is collaboration between industry, government, and clean energy providers to ensure this transformation not only reduces emissions but also maintains the competitiveness of national industry in the global market,” said Faricha.",https://iesr.or.id/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Faricha-Hidayati-Koordinator-Kebijakan-dan-Teknologi-Dekarbonisasi-Industri-IESR-dalam-Acara-AIGIS-2025.jpg,N,,2025-08-25 17:02:51.973816

The main factor in the decline in overall satisfaction is the cost of charging—respondents feel that both Level 2 and DC fast charging are too expensive.

A constant stream of reports about chargers that are difficult to use, buggy, or just plain broken has surely affected the rate of EV adoption, especially among frequent road-trippers. Fortunately, charging operators are well aware of the problems, and by all accounts, reliability is gradually improving.

Automotive data and analytics J.D. Power has confirmed the good news with some user data. The company’s U.S. Electric Vehicle Experience (EVX) Public Charging Study, now in its fifth year, measures EV owner satisfaction with public charge-point operators across 10 factors:

ease of charging

speed of charging

physical condition of charging station

availability of chargers

convenience of the location

things to do while charging

how safe you feel at the location

ease of finding the location

cost of charging

ease of payment

The 2025 study, conducted in collaboration with PlugShare, surveyed 7,428 owners of BEVs and PHEVs between January and June 2025. It breaks out the satisfaction ratings by region, and also provides a ranking of satisfaction levels for the leading charging providers.

The number of “non-charging visits” (when an owner visited a charger but was unable to charge their EV) has hit its lowest level in four years, J.D. Power reports, “a clear indicator that reliability and customer experience are steadily improving.”

Overall satisfaction has actually declined: satisfaction with DC fast chargers is 654 (on a 1,000-point scale), a 10-point decrease from the same period a year ago; satisfaction with public Level 2 charging has declined to 607, a 7-point decrease. However, satisfaction with charger reliability has improved. Only 14% of respondents said they had visited a charger without being able to charge their vehicle—a decrease of 5 percentage points from 2024.

The main factor in the decline in overall satisfaction is the cost of charging—respondents feel that both Level 2 and DC fast charging are too expensive.

“Part of the decrease in satisfaction is due to non-Tesla owners using Tesla Superchargers, which deliver a far less satisfying user experience relative to the costs incurred, in comparison to those of Tesla owners,” said Brent Gruber, Executive Director of the EV practice at J.D. Power. “Also, in previous years, many DC fast charging networks kept prices low as they developed their market presence, while manufacturers regularly offered free charging incentives with vehicle purchases. However, as the infrastructure market evolves and electricity rates rise, charging prices have increased significantly in some cases.”

Gruber attributes part of the increase in reliability to the influence of the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) program, which established minimum reliability standards as a requirement for funding. NEVI has unfortunately become a political football (at the moment it appears to be moving down the field), but whatever happens next, the reliability and quality guidelines it established have had a positive effect on the industry.

“With or without the federal funding, NEVI guidelines have made their mark by establishing a playbook for industry success,” said Brent Gruber. “Our data shows clear improvement in the reliability and success of public charging—a promising sign of progress for the industry.”

It must also be said that the charging industry has been responsive to the tide of customer complaints—networks including EVgo have undertaken initiatives to improve their reliability, standards body SAE International is working to establish reliability standards, and organizations such as ChargerHelp and PlugShare are helping to keep consumers informed.",https://chargedevs.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Rivian-Tesla-Supercharger-Chargedevs.com_.jpg,N,,2025-08-25 14:04:03.498423

The Zacks Rundown for General Motors","Chinese automakers’ rapid rise has forced global rivals to rethink their strategies. One example is the alliance between General Motors GM and Hyundai Motor, which centers on co-developing new vehicles. The two auto giants are now set to co-develop five vehicles to save costs while ensuring quality. As low-priced Chinese automakers continue to disrupt the markets, this effort is aimed at battling growing costs from trade wars while capturing market share.

Through this deal, General Motors will gain access to leading hybrid technology, while Hyundai will benefit by entering into new segments such as vans in North America and mid-sized pickups.

The companies expect to produce at least 800,000 vehicles annually as part of this collaboration. Four of the models- including a compact SUV/car/ pickup, and a mid-size pickup with the flexibility to use either internal combustion or hybrid propulsion systems- will target Central and South America. The fifth, an electric commercial van, is designed for the North American market. Production of all five vehicles is expected to begin in 2028 as full-fledged design and engineering work is underway.

GM will bring its expertise in mid-size truck development to the table, as Hyundai will focus on the compact vehicle and electric van development.

Together, they will work towards keeping a stronghold on the Detroit area to prevent Chinese automakers from competing with its high-tech, low-cost models. Chinese producers’ low-cost models had already pressed margins of legacy automakers in the United States; added to that came the burden of tariffs. Although the place of production has not been disclosed, any import from South Korea would imply a 15% tariff.

GM and Hyundai are not alone in turning to South Korea for an edge.

Tesla (TSLA), the pioneer in EV technology, also signed deals with South Korean companies such as Samsung Electronics and LG Energy Solution. Samsung will give Tesla access to advanced semiconductors that are crucial for self-driving systems and improve overall EV performance. This will safeguard Tesla from global chip shortages. LG will add diversification to Tesla’s dependence on Panasonic and its in-house 4680 cells for batteries- the biggest cost driver for EVs.

Whether alliances like GM-Hyundai can truly blunt China’s dominance remains to be seen, but they underscore a global shift: legacy players are leaning on partnerships to stay competitive in a rapidly changing auto market.

The Environmental Protection Agency abruptly announcing the cancellation of all $7 billion in Solar for All grants was a national setback for clean energy access. For groups like GRID Alternatives, the country’s largest nonprofit solar installer, the impact is measured in very specific losses: tens of thousands of low-income households, hundreds of millions in bill savings, and thousands of solar job opportunities.

GRID confirmed this week it has received official notice from EPA that its awards under Solar for All — nearly $330 million across two programs — are being rescinded. GRID and its affiliate, Tribal Energy Alternatives, planned to launch two initiatives with the funding:

The Solar Access for Nationwide Affordable Housing (SANAH) program, targeting affordable housing families.

The Western Indigenous Network – Solar for All (WIN-SFA), designed to expand Tribal energy sovereignty.

By 2029, those programs were projected to serve 40,000 households, generate $541 million in savings, create 6,700 job training opportunities, and avoid 3.4 million tons of CO2 emissions. All of it is now paused.

“When we applied for this grant, the intent was to serve Tribal Nations in the same excellence we have always done,” said Talia Martin, co-executive director of Tribal Energy Alternatives. “This program was meant to design a clean energy pathway for Tribal communities. … If anything, it emboldens our commitment to the work and lights us up.”

A nonprofit left in the lurch

GRID had already begun preparing its first Solar for All ribbon-cutting, planned in Traverse City, Michigan, in partnership with Habitat for Humanity. That project, along with sub-awards from other recipients eager to partner with GRID, is now on indefinite hold.

The organization stresses that the stakes go beyond individual rooftops. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, 34 million American households are energy insecure, often forced to choose between electricity and other basic needs. Solar for All was designed to address that inequity directly.

“GRID was and remains at the precipice of launching these historic programs with our partners, and that momentum has created real excitement across the country,” said Chris Walker, GRID’s chief policy & programs officer. “From American equipment manufacturers and affordable housing developers, to Tribal Nations, solar installers, and workforce development groups—everyone is ready to help deliver this program to the American people.”

The broader fallout

Earlier this month, EPA Administrator Michael Regan posted a video confirming the grants would be rescinded — a move legal experts and advocates argue is unlawful. And indeed, legal challenges are forming.

“If leaders in the Trump administration move forward with this unlawful attempt to strip critical funding from communities across the United States, we will see them in court,” said Kym Meyer, litigation director at the Southern Environmental Law Center.

In the meantime, families and communities that had been told relief was on the way are left waiting. For GRID Alternatives and its Tribal Energy partners, the rescission means pausing shovel-ready projects that could have lowered bills, supported affordable housing, and created jobs.

The shifting deadline comes amid a significant surge in EV sales.
Data from Cox Automotive reveals that new EV sales in July increased by 26.4% from the previous month and 19.7% year-over-year, reaching a total of 130,082 units.
Notably, 11 brands recorded their best sales of EVs for the year, as consumers scrambled to buy vehicles ahead of the expiration of the tax credit.
Experts suggest that the urgency surrounding the tax credit will likely sustain strong performance in the EV market through the third quarter.","Prospective buyers of electric vehicles (EVs) have received a reprieve regarding the impending expiration of the $7,500 federal EV tax credit, which is now set to be more flexible than initially anticipated. Originally, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBB) legislation established a hard deadline of September 30 for consumers to sign contracts and receive their vehicles to be eligible for this significant tax incentive. However, new guidance issued by the IRS has altered these parameters for consumers planning to purchase EVs from major manufacturers such as Tesla, GM, and Ford.

According to the IRS, the term “acquired” does not strictly imply that vehicle delivery must occur before the September 30 deadline. Instead, buyers need only to secure a binding contract and make a payment by this date. This development allows consumers who sign contracts and pay deposits to claim the credit when they take possession of the vehicle—regardless of whether the actual delivery happens after the deadline.

This new interpretation provides a critical opportunity for prospective buyers, as it means that dealerships can continue to fulfill orders without having inventory readily available at the time of the sale. Buyers interested in this arrangement will need to obtain a “time of sale report” from the dealer upon taking possession of the vehicle, which can then be submitted through the Energy Credits Online portal for credit claim.

The shifting deadline comes amid a significant surge in EV sales. Data from Cox Automotive reveals that new EV sales in July increased by 26.4% from the previous month and 19.7% year-over-year, reaching a total of 130,082 units. This surge raised the market share of EVs to 9.1%, marking July as the second-highest month for sales on record. Notably, 11 brands recorded their best sales of EVs for the year, as consumers scrambled to buy vehicles ahead of the expiration of the tax credit.

Despite the increase in sales, Cox also reported a swift decline in the days of EV supply, dropping to 87 days. This marks a 32.3% reduction from the previous month and a staggering 49% drop year-over-year, indicating potential challenges ahead for both consumers and manufacturers as the summer transitions into fall.

Experts suggest that the urgency surrounding the tax credit will likely sustain strong performance in the EV market through the third quarter. Stephanie Valdez Streaty, a director of insights at Cox Automotive, noted that the market could face a substantial downturn in sales during the fourth quarter once the tax credit expires and deliveries are completed.

Research from last year highlights the importance of the tax incentive; a report titled “The Effects of ‘Buy American’: Electric Vehicles and the Inflation Reduction Act” aimed to quantify the tax credit’s significant impact on consumer behavior and market dynamics. As the deadline approaches, manufacturers and buyers alike are poised to navigate this evolving landscape, hoping to maximize potential advantages before policy changes take full effect.",https://news.ssbcrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IRS-Extends-Deadline-for-EV-Tax-Credit-Eligibility-Boosting-Sales.jpeg,N,,2025-08-25 14:04:49.682862

TXNM's current operations already generate stable cash flows from regulated utilities, while Blackstone's capital infusion accelerates decarbonization and grid resilience.
The Bigger Picture: Private Capital in the Energy Transition Blackstone's TXNM acquisition is part of a broader trend: private capital is increasingly stepping into the void left by underfunded public infrastructure.
Conclusion: A Strategic Bet on the Future Blackstone's $11.5 billion TXNM acquisition is more than a financial transaction—it's a strategic alignment with the U.S. energy transition.
In an era of energy scarcity and climate urgency, this acquisition exemplifies how private capital can be a force for good.","The U.S. energy sector is at a pivotal inflection point. With electricity demand projected to surge by 78% by 2050, driven by electrification of transportation, data centers, and industrial growth, the need for resilient, modernized infrastructure has never been more urgent. Blackstone Infrastructure's $11.5 billion acquisition of Texas New Media (TXNM) Energy—a regulated utility operating in New Mexico and Texas—positions the firm as a key player in this transformation. This deal, structured to align with long-term infrastructure trends and regulatory dynamics, offers a compelling case study in how private capital can catalyze the energy transition while navigating complex policy landscapes.

Strategic Alignment with Energy Demand and Grid Modernization

The acquisition is rooted in a simple but powerful thesis: the U.S. energy grid is ill-equipped to meet the demands of the 21st century. According to the EIA's Annual Energy Outlook 2025, peak electricity demand is expected to grow by 54% by 2050, with Texas and New Mexico—TXNM's core markets—serving as critical nodes in this expansion. Blackstone's all-cash, debt-free structure ensures TXNM retains a strong balance sheet to fund infrastructure upgrades, including 450 megawatts of solar and battery storage projects in New Mexico. These projects directly align with PNM's 2040 carbon-free goal and New Mexico's broader clean energy mandates, which require 100% zero-carbon electricity by 2045.

The deal's $400 million equity injection from Blackstone further underscores its focus on long-term value creation. By avoiding incremental debt, the firm preserves flexibility to scale investments in grid-enhancing technologies, such as dynamic line ratings and non-wires alternatives, which are critical for addressing supply chain bottlenecks and extreme weather risks. For context, the EIA estimates that permitting-process reforms alone could save $10 billion annually in development costs—a metric that highlights the urgency of private-sector involvement in infrastructure modernization.

Regulatory Dynamics: A Double-Edged Sword

While the acquisition is strategically sound, regulatory hurdles remain a wildcard. TXNM must secure approvals from the New Mexico Public Regulation Commission (NMPRC), the Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUCT), and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). PUCT and FERC have fixed 180-day review periods, but the NMPRC lacks a timeline, introducing uncertainty. To mitigate this, the transaction includes a $210 million termination fee for Blackstone if the deal is blocked by regulatory delays and a $350 million fee for TXNM if Blackstone withdraws. This asymmetry reflects Blackstone's confidence in the transaction's viability but also signals the high stakes of navigating a fragmented regulatory environment.

New Mexico's 2025 legislative session provides a favorable backdrop. The state passed SB48, a $210 million Community Benefit Fund for clean energy and methane reduction, and HB93, which mandates emissions reductions in grid modernization plans. These policies align with Blackstone's $225 million ratepayer benefits package, which includes rate credits and community investments to address privatization concerns. Meanwhile, Texas's deregulated market offers complementary opportunities. TNMP's growth in competitive retail energy markets—driven by expanding commercial and residential demand—positions the firm to capitalize on Texas's aggressive renewable energy adoption.

Investment Implications: Balancing Risk and Reward

For investors, the acquisition represents a high-conviction bet on a sector poised for structural growth. TXNM's current operations already generate stable cash flows from regulated utilities, while Blackstone's capital infusion accelerates decarbonization and grid resilience. The 23% premium offered to shareholders (based on the 30-day VWAP) signals confidence in TXNM's long-term earnings potential, despite a 58% year-over-year decline in non-GAAP EPS in Q2 2025. This premium also reflects the market's recognition of the strategic value of aligning with the energy transition.

However, risks persist. Regulatory delays could push the deal's closure to late 2026, and the lack of a fixed timeline for NMPRC approval introduces execution risk. Additionally, while Blackstone's perpetual capital model reduces leverage concerns, the firm's success hinges on its ability to execute on TXNM's growth plans without overextending its balance sheet. Investors should monitor the pace of solar and battery storage deployment in New Mexico, as well as the fulfillment of ratepayer benefits, to gauge the deal's operational and reputational success.

The Bigger Picture: Private Capital in the Energy Transition

Blackstone's TXNM acquisition is part of a broader trend: private capital is increasingly stepping into the void left by underfunded public infrastructure. The firm's recent $6.5 billion acquisition of Enverus, an energy data analytics platform, further illustrates this strategy. By integrating AI-driven insights into grid planning and asset optimization, Blackstone is positioning itself as a leader in data-driven infrastructure. This dual focus on physical and digital modernization—coupled with its emphasis on stakeholder alignment—sets a blueprint for how private equity can drive systemic change in energy systems.

Conclusion: A Strategic Bet on the Future

Blackstone's $11.5 billion TXNM acquisition is more than a financial transaction—it's a strategic alignment with the U.S. energy transition. By leveraging perpetual capital, navigating regulatory complexities, and prioritizing stakeholder engagement, the firm is addressing the twin challenges of aging infrastructure and climate resilience. For investors, the deal offers exposure to a high-growth, low-volatility sector with long-term cash flow visibility. While regulatory risks remain, the potential rewards—both financial and societal—are substantial.

If operated to its maximum potential, PNM claims the BESS portfolio will eliminate more than 18,000 tonnes of CO2 emissions per year through the avoidance of equivalent fossil fuel usage.
The estimated cost of the installations is approximately US$78.7 million, which PNM plans to recover as part of a future rate case.
Of the total estimated cost, Gridworks is set to receive US$71.5 million to “fully design, engineer, and install” the systems’ BESS technology, which will be transferred to PNM upon completion.
PNM says that any 48E ITC benefit it receives to offset tax liability will be returned to customers.","Details of the five PNM-owned solar sites to be retrofitted with BESS can be found below:

After receiving bids from three suppliers, PNM negotiated a deal with Albuquerque, New Mexico-based EPC specialist Gridworks, which will deliver the project as part of a turnkey solution.

As previously reported by Energy-Storage.news, this isn’t the first time Gridworks has been successful in a PNM-administered RFP, after it secured an EPC contract last year to deliver a 30MW/120MWh co-located BESS for the utility.

Recent filings with the NMPRC reveal that the utility included Tesla’s 2XL Megapack in planning documents for the five sites that use lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery technology. However, this does not necessarily mean Tesla Megapacks will eventually be procured for the project, as planning submissions can indicate an intended design to show regulators and authorities.

As explained by PNM as part of its application, LFP technology is “widely recognised as the safest option for utility scale storage due to its minimal risk of thermal runaway compared to chemistries such as nickel manganese cobalt (NMC).”

BESS over fossil fuels: Reducing costs as well as emissions

As part of its justification for the project, PNM believes the project will reduce its use of fossil fuels to meet peak system demand while also reducing costs for customers.

“By storing excess solar energy for use during peak demand, the BESS reduces curtailment of renewable generation and offsets the historical reliance on fossil-fuelled resources during high-demand periods,” explained Engineering Manager for PNM, Nicholas Pollman, as part of a recent testimony filed with the NMPRC.

If operated to its maximum potential, PNM claims the BESS portfolio will eliminate more than 18,000 tonnes of CO2 emissions per year through the avoidance of equivalent fossil fuel usage.

The estimated cost of the installations is approximately US$78.7 million, which PNM plans to recover as part of a future rate case.

Of the total estimated cost, Gridworks is set to receive US$71.5 million to “fully design, engineer, and install” the systems’ BESS technology, which will be transferred to PNM upon completion.

PNM has requested the NMPRC approve the CPCN no later than May 6 2026 in order to deliver the project by June 2027 in time for the utility’s peak electricity demand which is expected to occur during the summer.

US$28 million benefits from ITCs

With investment tax credits (ITCs) for utility-scale storage having avoided an early phaseout due to last-minute changes to the so-called ‘One, Big, Beautiful Bill Act,’ (‘OBBB’), PNM expects to receive approximately US$28 million in benefits under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).

PNM has estimated an ITC benefit of 30% – 40% for each project, with the utility expecting all five projects to receive the base 6% credit along with the 24% credit adder for Prevailing Wages & Apprenticeship. It also expects three out of the five to qualify for the additional 10% ‘Energy Communities’ adder.

As part of its calculations, PNM excluded the additional 10% ‘Domestic Content’ adder, which it said will only be determined “at the time the batteries and equipment are ordered” for the BESS portfolio.

The export authorization allows LNG sales to countries without free-trade agreements with the United States, the company said.

Sempra Infrastructure previously selected Bechtel to handle engineering, procurement and construction for the Phase 2 facility, according to the release. In July, the company signed a separate 20-year agreement with JERA Co. Inc. for 1.5 million metric tons per annum from the proposed project, Sempra said.

The project remains subject to completing commercial agreements, maintaining permits, securing financing and reaching a final investment decision, according to the company. Sempra targets making a financial investment decision on Phase 2 in 2025, the release stated.

Martin said the expansion reflects ""both companies' shared view of the opportunity to connect American producers of natural gas with growing markets overseas, while also driving economic growth and job creation here at home,"" according to Sempra.",https://media.12newsnow.com/assets/KBMT/images/a552540a-e420-4f10-a7f4-030d130b45fa/20250825T161842/a552540a-e420-4f10-a7f4-030d130b45fa_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-08-25 13:06:59.328782

Rhode Island Gov.
Ned Lamont spoke at State Pier in New London, where components for the Revolution Wind project are kept before being taken out to sea.
Rhode Island is already home to one offshore wind farm in state waters, the five-turbine Block Island Wind Farm.
The Trump administration previously stopped work on Empire Wind, the New York offshore wind project.","A nearly complete wind farm off the coast of Rhode Island and Connecticut faces an uncertain future as the states' Democratic governors, members of Congress and union workers are calling Monday for the Trump administration to let construction resume.

The administration halted construction on the Revolution Wind project last week, saying the federal government needs to review the project and address national security concerns. It did not specify what those concerns are. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management said Monday it's not commenting further at this time.

The Democratic politicians are getting involved because stopping work on Revolution Wind threatens local jobs and their states' climate goals, and could drive up electricity prices throughout the region. Officials say the project is 80% complete, with all the underwater foundations and 45 out of 65 turbines already installed.

Large, ocean-based wind farms are the linchpin of government plans to shift to renewable energy, particularly in East Coast states with large populations and limited land for wind turbines or solar arrays.

President Donald Trump has made sweeping strides to prioritize fossil fuels and hinder renewable energy projects. Those include reviewing wind and solar energy permits, canceling plans to use large areas of federal waters for new offshore wind development and stopping work on another offshore wind project under construction for New York, although construction was later allowed to resume.

Rhode Island Gov. Dan McKee is headed to North Kingstown, where the logistics and operations hub for the project is located. The governor has said the wind farm is critical to the region’s economy and energy future. Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont spoke at State Pier in New London, where components for the Revolution Wind project are kept before being taken out to sea.

U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut said during Monday's press conference that it was “nuts, crazy, insane” to halt a fully approved project that would save ratepayers hundreds of millions of dollars. He expects the courts to agree that the Trump administration acted unlawfully when it stopped the project based on “secret information.”

Revolution Wind is expected to be Rhode Island and Connecticut’s first large offshore wind farm, capable of powering more than 350,000 homes. Power would be provided at a rate of 9.8 cents per kilowatt hour, locked in for 20 years. That is cheaper than the average cost of electricity in New England.

About 1,000 union members have been working on Revolution Wind, and those jobs are now at risk.

“This isn’t work that anybody can do,” Keith Brothers, business manager of the Connecticut Laborers’ District Council, said about the specialized skills the workers on this project have. “We’ve taken people from the military, we’ve placed them on jobs on this specific site, that’s important.”

A statement from North America’s Building Trades Unions was more direct: “President Donald Trump just fired 1,000 of our members.”

The developer, Danish energy company Orsted, is evaluating the financial impact of stopping construction and considering legal proceedings.

The project site is more than 15 miles (24 kilometers) south of the Rhode Island coast, 32 miles (51 kilometers) southeast of the Connecticut coast and 12 miles (19 kilometers) southwest of Martha’s Vineyard. Rhode Island is already home to one offshore wind farm in state waters, the five-turbine Block Island Wind Farm.

The Trump administration previously stopped work on Empire Wind, the New York offshore wind project. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said it appeared former President Joe Biden’s administration had “rushed through” the approvals, although the developer Equinor spent seven years obtaining permits. Construction was allowed to resume in May after two of the state's Democratic leaders, U.S. Sen. Chuck Schumer and Gov. Kathy Hochul, intervened.

The proposed funding opportunity supports demonstration and/or commercial facilities processing, recycling, or utilizing for manufacturing critical materials which may include traditional battery minerals such as lithium, graphite, nickel, copper, aluminum, as well as other minerals that are contained within commercially available batteries, such as rare earth elements.
Recover Critical Minerals from Industrial Wastewater The Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E) is planning to announce project selections for its $40 million program to develop technologies to recover critical minerals from industrial wastewater early this fall.
Significant amounts of critical minerals exist in domestic wastewater systems, untreated and discarded.","In order to advance and scale mining, processing, and manufacturing technologies across key stages of the critical minerals and materials supply chains, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) recently announced its intent to issue notices of funding opportunities (NOFO) totaling nearly $1 billion. The funding announcements aim to help ensure a more secure, predictable, and affordable supply of critical minerals and materials within the United States.

When announced on August 13, 2025, DOE noted the NOFOs have been issued in accordance with President Trump’s Executive Order “Unleashing American Energy.”

“For too long, the United States has relied on foreign actors to supply and process the critical materials that are essential to modern life and our national security,” said U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright. “Thanks to President Trump’s leadership, the Energy Department will play a leading role in reshoring the processing of critical materials and expanding our domestic supply of these indispensable resources.”

The proposed NOFOs include:

Critical Minerals and Materials Accelerator

The Advanced Materials and Manufacturing Technologies Office expects to release a NOFO of up to $50 million in early Fall 2025 through the Critical Minerals and Materials (CMM) Accelerator program. The CMM Accelerator promotes technology maturation that can unlock capital investments and facilitate domestic commercialization. The proposed NOFO addresses several areas of interest, including processes in the rare-earth magnet supply chain; processes to refine and alloy gallium, gallium nitride, germanium, and silicon carbide for use in semiconductors; cost-competitive technologies for direct lithium extraction and separation; and critical-material separation technologies that allow for the co-production of useful products from byproducts and scrap.

Mines & Metals Capacity Expansion – Piloting Byproduct Critical Minerals and Materials Recovery at Domestic Industrial Facilities

The Office of Fossil Energy and Carbon Management is announcing its intent to issue a NOFO to support approximately $250 million of financial assistance for American industrial facilities that have the potential to produce valuable mineral byproducts from existing industrial processes. To derisk the technical uncertainty and financial risk for commercial deployment, many technologies must be piloted at an industrial scale in an industrial facility where material feedstocks can be processed. The proposed NOFO addresses topic areas pertaining to both industry at large and the coal-based industry.

Rare Earth Elements Demonstration Facility

The Office of Manufacturing and Energy Supply Chains (MESC) is announcing its intent to issue a NOFO of up to $135 million to enhance domestic supply chains for rare earth elements (REEs). The goal of this initiative is to reduce America’s dependence on foreign sources of REEs by demonstrating the commercial viability of methods for domestically refining and recovering REEs from mine tailings, deleterious material, and waste streams. An academic partner is required as a part of the project team and an award requires a cost-share of at least 50% by the recipient.

Battery Materials Processing and Battery Manufacturing and Recycling Grant Program

MESC is announcing its intent to issue a NOFO of up to $500 million to expand U.S. critical mineral and materials processing and derivative battery manufacturing and recycling. The proposed funding opportunity supports demonstration and/or commercial facilities processing, recycling, or utilizing for manufacturing critical materials which may include traditional battery minerals such as lithium, graphite, nickel, copper, aluminum, as well as other minerals that are contained within commercially available batteries, such as rare earth elements. An award requires a cost-share of at least 50% by the recipient.

Recover Critical Minerals from Industrial Wastewater

The Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E) is planning to announce project selections for its $40 million program to develop technologies to recover critical minerals from industrial wastewater early this fall. ARPA-E’s Realize Energy-rich Compound Opportunities Valorizing Extraction from Refuse waters (RECOVER) program aims to enable the U.S. to reduce its dependence on critical mineral imports and replace them with secure, domestic sources. Significant amounts of critical minerals exist in domestic wastewater systems, untreated and discarded. RECOVER technologies complement more traditional mining operations to access these materials and potentially meet a significant portion of America’s needs using supplies that might otherwise go to waste.",https://businessfacilities.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/rare_earth_oxides.jpg,N,,2025-08-25 13:07:04.695916

The conference brought together thought leaders, innovators, policymakers, researchers, and advocates from across the renewable energy community to share ideas, inspire innovation, and build momentum for the clean energy transformation.

This year's theme, ""Innovation for Universal Renewable Energy Access,"" set the stage for conversations on climate resilience, energy justice, and the technologies driving us toward a more sustainable future. Attendees arrived curious at the state of the industry given recent federal changes, and went away feeling that solar is here to stay. The industry is strong enough to persist without federal subsidies and still requires support at the local and state levels. Attendees engaged in dynamic sessions, expanded interactive poster sessions, hands-on workshops, ASES' first-ever career fair, and networking opportunities that fostered collaboration across sectors.

Throughout the conference, several recurring themes emerged, underscoring the breadth and urgency of today's renewable energy transformation. Presentations and discussions highlighted the growing importance of policies that ensure equitable access to energy, particularly for low-income families and communities. Innovations in agrivoltaics, including approaches that integrate solar with crops, livestock, and natural habitats, showed how solar can enhance rather than compete with agricultural and ecological systems. Building-integrated solar and grid advancements demonstrated how renewable energy is shaping both our infrastructure and our daily lives. Sessions also explored tipping points for solar, wind, and batteries, as well as the global forces driving the transition--policy and geopolitics, climate and sustainability risks, artificial intelligence, energy transition financing, critical minerals competition, and the rapid growth of cleantech industries.

The conference concluded with a call to action: governments, companies, and the general public must work together to embed transparency, inclusiveness, and good governance into every level of the renewable energy sector. This includes policy frameworks, procurement processes, investment practices, and community advocacy.

Canada Canada is nearing 550,000 EVs, with electric vehicles making nearly 9.4% of new car sales by early 2023.
Conclusion Therefore, this shows that the electric vehicles have stepped into the fast lane globally and are led by China.","According to the IEA Global EV Outlook 2025, from massive fleets in Asia to record-breaking sales in Europe and North America, electric cars are reshaping the future of mobility. For the United States as well, the rise of EVs is closely tied to tax credits, Tesla’s dominance, and new federal infrastructure plans. Further in India, growing awareness and local EV production show the potential for similar momentum. This article lists the Top 10 countries with the most electric cars in 2025, explaining their growth, policies, and innovations driving adoption.

List of Top 10 Countries with the Most Electric Cars (End-2024)

The list below shows the 10 countries with the most electric car fleets and sales at the end of 2024:

Check Out: Future of Automobile Industry of India

(Disclaimer: Figures are rounded, based on IEA Global EV Outlook 2025 and its public dataset via Our World in Data.) Here are the top 10 countries that rank in the electric-car fleet according to the IEA Global EV Outlook :

1. China

China leads the world in electric cars, with a fleet of over 20 million BEVs and PHEVs as of 2024. In 2024 alone, it sold around 11 million electric cars, nearly half of all vehicles sold in the country were electric. This push was powered by aggressive incentives such as generous trade-in schemes offering up to CNY 20,000 for EV buyers and the reign of domestic manufacturers like BYD and SAIC, as reported by IEA.

2. United States

The US holds the second-largest EV fleet, at approximately 7 million plug-in cars. In 2024, about 1.6 million EVs were sold. Although growth has slowed compared to prior years, with just a 10% increase over 2023. Moreover, new tax incentives under the Inflation Reduction Act and more affordable models continue to support demand.

3. Germany

After the United States, Germany is the largest EV market in Europe, which is home to about 1.4 million BEVs and PHEVs. Apart from this, it recorded over 500,000 new battery-electric registrations in 2023. However, the sales share of electric vehicles dropped from 30% in 2022 to around 25% in 2023. Ongoing efforts aim to stabilise incentives to maintain momentum.

4. France

France comes after Germany in Europe’s EV market, which also boasts a large fleet of plug-in vehicles with over 790,000 since 2010. Also, it is backed by the government’s bonus-malus system, which gives strong financial incentives for clean car purchases. Along with it, charging infrastructure investments and a pledge to phase out fossil fuel car sales by 2040 are also promised.

5. United Kingdom

The UK features in the top five, with an estimated 1.3 million EVs on the road. As reported by IEA, roughly 25% of new car sales are electric. Some markets strain under subsidy reductions due to a broadening choice of models and consumer purchase incentives.

6. Norway

Though small in population, Norway leads globally in per capita with around 900,000 EVs. In 2024, an astonishing almost 95% of new car sales were electric, a level driven by long-standing supportive policies and near-complete reliance on renewable electricity.

7. Netherlands

The Netherlands rounds out the high adopters with roughly 560,000 EVs. In 2023, around 30% of new cars sold were electric, reflecting progress toward greener transport through subsidies and infrastructure, but still trailing Norway.

8. Sweden

After the Netherlands, Sweden's EV fleet stands at about 550,000 vehicles. Moreover, it ranks with a striking 39.8% of new car sales being electric in late 2023. The country also benefits from strong incentives and escalating public interest in EVs as sustainable transport choices.

9. Canada

Canada is nearing 550,000 EVs, with electric vehicles making nearly 9.4% of new car sales by early 2023. Adoption is growing steadily, aided by federal rebates and expanding charging networks, though adoption still trails aggressive leaders in Europe and Asia.

10. South Korea

South Korea completes the top ten, approaching 500,000 plug-in vehicles. However, EVs account for just under 7% of new cars sold, which means there is a vast room for growth, especially with strong local players planning major EV rollouts.

Conclusion

Therefore, this shows that the electric vehicles have stepped into the fast lane globally and are led by China. All these are supported by a mix of incentives, innovation, and infrastructure. Markets like Sweden show how policy can turbo-charge adoption, while others still have plenty of room to catch up. Norway ranks highly due to its world-leading per-capita EV penetration. Along with this, Canada and South Korea round out the top 10, both around the half-million mark. Germany, France, and the UK rank between 3rd and 5th position, which are close in fleet size, with each around 1.3–1.4 million plug-in cars.

Skills training could be provided through education schemes, training facilities, new equipment or work experience and internships, creating new opportunities for local workers.
This could include a commitment to a ‘Fair Worker Charter’ co-developed between industry and trade unions.
A highly skilled, fairly paid and secure clean energy workforce is essential to achieving these goals.
“UNISON has long argued that the government needs to invest in retraining existing energy workers so their skills and experience can be transferred to clean energy jobs.","A new requirement for offshore wind developers to pay for skills training in their local communities has been announced.

A Fair Work Charter has been set out in proposals published over the weekend, working with Unions and business, that will require offshore wind developers to pay into a skills fund or spend a minimum amount on skills training in their local communities to support oil and gas workers, apprentices or school leavers move into the UK’s growing offshore wind industry.

Skills training could be provided through education schemes, training facilities, new equipment or work experience and internships, creating new opportunities for local workers.

Proposals also encourage developers and supply chain firms to create more high-quality, secure jobs in offshore wind, with better access to trade unions and stronger protections on pay and terms and conditions. This could include a commitment to a ‘Fair Worker Charter’ co-developed between industry and trade unions.

Research published last year by The Crown Estate showed these new wind farms in the Celtic Sea could support the creation of more than 5,000 jobs and deliver a £1.4 billion boost to the economy, with further opportunities through the supply chain.

Industry estimates a typical salary for an offshore wind worker is £10,000 higher than the UK average, with 90% of the UK’s oil and gas workforce having skills that are transferrable into offshore renewables.

These changes will help ensure these jobs are always skilled, secure and well-paid as more of these jobs become available on the clean energy transition providing long-term stability and job opportunities.

Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said:

“Britain’s clean energy future will be powered by secure, unionised jobs for local people right across the country.

“We’re backing businesses that invest in working people in these communities, securing a route to long-term careers for oil and gas workers, apprentices and school leavers, as we deliver our Plan for Change.”

Christina McAnea, General Secretary at UNISON, said:

“Clean, homegrown energy is vital to Britain’s future growth and to tackling climate change. A highly skilled, fairly paid and secure clean energy workforce is essential to achieving these goals.

“UNISON has long argued that the government needs to invest in retraining existing energy workers so their skills and experience can be transferred to clean energy jobs. Investment in apprenticeships and opportunities for young people is crucial in building the workforce of tomorrow.

“This initiative offers a chance to boost skills across the energy sector, create and protect well-paid jobs, and support the renewal of coastal communities and industrial regions. Working together under a Fair Work Charter, unions, government and business – can deliver growth and stronger protection for workers.”

Eddie Dempsey, General Secretary at RMT, said:

“We welcome the commitments to make trade union recognition and strong pro-worker standards a part of offshore wind contracts, covering re-training, protecting pay, and working conditions.

“This ensures that oil and gas workers are not being left behind.

“Alongside the Employment Rights Bill and wider pledges to strengthen offshore workers’ rights, including for seafarers in the supply chain, the progress so far shows a plan is coming together.

“That will give our members confidence that their livelihoods will be protected through these turbulent times.”

Sue Ferns OBE, Senior Deputy General Secretary at Prospect, said:

“Transitioning to a clean energy future will mean tens of thousands of new jobs being created across the UK, and it is welcome to see a clear commitment from the government that these should be good quality, unionised jobs.

“Training the clean energy workforce of tomorrow is one of the biggest challenges we face, and it is only fair that renewables developers that rely on this labour contribute to skills programmes.

“While progress has been made on unionisation in renewables, there is still more to do, and Prospect has been calling for the strongest possible signal from government that they expect companies receiving public money or participating in public procurement processes to work with and recognise trade unions.”

This comes ahead of the UK’s first ever Clean Energy Workforce Strategy, which will ensure that clean energy jobs are not only widely available, but also high-quality. Offshore wind will be the backbone of Britain’s future energy needs, offering skilled jobs on good wages, and the opportunity to build a varied and fulfilling career.

Offshore wind requires skilled workers across the country in areas such as blade repair, mechanics, wind turbine maintenance, marine spatial planning and health and safety protocols.

But in some parts of the sector workers and trade unions have called for more consistency around workplace standards and trade union access to support these roles. Today’s proposals would ensure the industry is always delivering for its workforce by encouraging them to work in partnership with trade unions to develop stable, long-term jobs.

The measures would be introduced through the Clean Industry Bonus, which provides offshore wind developers with funding on the condition that they build new factories in deprived regions or invest in more sustainable supply chains to drive economic growth.

The consultation will also seek views on the introduction of onshore wind into the Clean Industry Bonus to help turbocharge its deployment in the UK after years of stagnation due to the de-facto ban under the previous government. This follows the government’s launch of the first ever onshore wind strategy earlier this year, and will get the country building again, as the sector is estimated to support up to 45,000 jobs in Great Britain by 2030.",https://businessnewswales.com/wp-content/uploads/Offshore-Wind-2.jpg,N,,2025-08-25 16:04:29.572995

The deregulated market pushes providers to offer better deals, creating competitive pressure that helps keep Texas electricity rates consistently below the national average.”

— Christian Linden

HOUSTON, TX, UNITED STATES, August 25, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- Texas continues to maintain a competitive edge in electricity pricing, with average rates of 15.47¢ per kilowatt-hour (kWh), slightly below the national average of 16.22¢ per kWh. Monthly electricity bills for Texans average around $230, influenced by the state’s unique market structure and abundant energy resources.

The Texas electricity market operates under a deregulated model, allowing consumers to select their electricity providers from a variety of options, fostering competition that helps keep rates lower. This market structure, combined with an abundant supply of natural gas and a growing wind energy sector, positions Texas as a frontrunner in affordable electricity costs.

According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), Texas ranks 29th nationwide for residential electricity rates, maintaining its position despite a slight increase of 1.66% from the previous year. The EIA’s latest data reflects that residential electricity rates averaged 17.11¢ per kWh in March 2025, showcasing a year-over-year increase of 2.6%.

Understanding Electricity Costs

Electricity prices are determined by various factors, including the cost of power generation, transmission across the state’s grid, and state and local fees. For commercial users, Texas boasts significantly lower rates at 9.00¢ per kWh compared to the national average of 13.27¢ per kWh, translating to substantial savings for businesses operating in the state.

To effectively manage costs, Texans should consider their end-of-contract electricity strategy. This involves evaluating options before contracts expire to avoid being placed on higher variable rates. Understanding how to compare electricity plans in Texas is crucial for ensuring that consumers make informed decisions that align with their energy needs and budget.

Additionally, residents can further reduce their electric bills by investing in energy-efficient products. These products not only help lower monthly expenses but also contribute to a more sustainable energy future.

Factors Influencing Texas Electricity Rates

Several factors contribute to the comparatively low electricity rates in Texas:

Natural Gas Dependency: Over 40% of Texas's electricity is generated from natural gas, keeping costs down compared to states relying on more expensive fuel sources.

Deregulated Market: The ability of residents to choose their electricity providers promotes competition, leading to better rates and services for consumers.

Diverse Energy Resources: Texas is a leader in wind energy generation and is increasing its solar capacity, contributing to a diversified energy mix that stabilizes costs.

Regional Variations: Electricity rates can vary significantly within Texas due to local conditions, infrastructure quality, and proximity to energy resources.

Conclusion

As the electricity market in Texas continues to evolve, residents and businesses are encouraged to remain informed about their energy options. Understanding the factors that influence electricity costs can lead to more strategic decisions when selecting providers and managing energy consumption.

A nearly complete wind farm off the coast of Rhode Island and Connecticut faces an uncertain future as the states’ Democratic governors, members of Congress and union workers are calling Monday for the Trump administration to let construction resume.

The administration halted construction on the Revolution Wind project last week, saying the federal government needs to review the project and address national security concerns. It did not specify what those concerns are. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management said Monday it’s not commenting further at this time.

The Democratic politicians are getting involved because stopping work on Revolution Wind threatens local jobs and their states’ climate goals, and could drive up electricity prices throughout the region. Officials say the project is 80% complete, with all the underwater foundations and 45 out of 65 turbines already installed.

Large, ocean-based wind farms are the linchpin of government plans to shift to renewable energy, particularly in East Coast states with large populations and limited land for wind turbines or solar arrays.

President Donald Trump has made sweeping strides to prioritize fossil fuels and hinder renewable energy projects. Those include reviewing wind and solar energy permits, canceling plans to use large areas of federal waters for new offshore wind development and stopping work on another offshore wind project under construction for New York, although construction was later allowed to resume.

Rhode Island Gov. Dan McKee is headed to North Kingstown, where the logistics and operations hub for the project is located. The governor has said the wind farm is critical to the region’s economy and energy future. Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont spoke at State Pier in New London, where components for the Revolution Wind project are kept before being taken out to sea.

U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut said during Monday’s press conference that it was “nuts, crazy, insane” to halt a fully approved project that would save ratepayers hundreds of millions of dollars. He expects the courts to agree that the Trump administration acted unlawfully when it stopped the project based on “secret information.”

Revolution Wind is expected to be Rhode Island and Connecticut’s first large offshore wind farm, capable of powering more than 350,000 homes. Power would be provided at a rate of 9.8 cents per kilowatt hour, locked in for 20 years. That is cheaper than the average cost of electricity in New England.

About 1,000 union members have been working on Revolution Wind, and those jobs are now at risk.

“This isn’t work that anybody can do,” Keith Brothers, business manager of the Connecticut Laborers’ District Council, said about the specialized skills the workers on this project have. “We’ve taken people from the military, we’ve placed them on jobs on this specific site, that’s important.”

A statement from North America’s Building Trades Unions was more direct: “President Donald Trump just fired 1,000 of our members.”

The developer, Danish energy company Orsted, is evaluating the financial impact of stopping construction and considering legal proceedings.

The project site is more than 15 miles (24 kilometers) south of the Rhode Island coast, 32 miles (51 kilometers) southeast of the Connecticut coast and 12 miles (19 kilometers) southwest of Martha’s Vineyard. Rhode Island is already home to one offshore wind farm in state waters, the five-turbine Block Island Wind Farm.

The Trump administration previously stopped work on Empire Wind, the New York offshore wind project. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said it appeared former President Joe Biden’s administration had “rushed through” the approvals, although the developer Equinor spent seven years obtaining permits. Construction was allowed to resume in May after two of the state’s Democratic leaders, U.S. Sen. Chuck Schumer and Gov. Kathy Hochul, intervened.

The conference brought together thought leaders, innovators, policymakers, researchers, and advocates from across the renewable energy community to share ideas, inspire innovation, and build momentum for the clean energy transformation.

This year's theme, ""Innovation for Universal Renewable Energy Access,"" set the stage for conversations on climate resilience, energy justice, and the technologies driving us toward a more sustainable future. Attendees arrived curious at the state of the industry given recent federal changes, and went away feeling that solar is here to stay. The industry is strong enough to persist without federal subsidies and still requires support at the local and state levels. Attendees engaged in dynamic sessions, expanded interactive poster sessions, hands-on workshops, ASES' first-ever career fair, and networking opportunities that fostered collaboration across sectors.

Throughout the conference, several recurring themes emerged, underscoring the breadth and urgency of today's renewable energy transformation. Presentations and discussions highlighted the growing importance of policies that ensure equitable access to energy, particularly for low-income families and communities. Innovations in agrivoltaics, including approaches that integrate solar with crops, livestock, and natural habitats, showed how solar can enhance rather than compete with agricultural and ecological systems. Building-integrated solar and grid advancements demonstrated how renewable energy is shaping both our infrastructure and our daily lives. Sessions also explored tipping points for solar, wind, and batteries, as well as the global forces driving the transition--policy and geopolitics, climate and sustainability risks, artificial intelligence, energy transition financing, critical minerals competition, and the rapid growth of cleantech industries.

The conference concluded with a call to action: governments, companies, and the general public must work together to embed transparency, inclusiveness, and good governance into every level of the renewable energy sector. This includes policy frameworks, procurement processes, investment practices, and community advocacy.

Wording in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBB) legislation that killed the $7,500 federal EV tax credit set a hard Sept. 30 deadline for claiming the EV tax credit. Manufacturers believed it meant contract signing and delivery had to occur before that date.

While accelerating some timelines for the expiration of other clean energy tax credits, new guidance put forth by the IRS provides some wiggle room for EV buyers.

The IRS now says the meaning of the word ""acquired"" under the law doesn't necessarily mean delivery must take place before the deadline.

""If a taxpayer acquires a vehicle by having a written binding contract in place and a payment made on or before September 30, 2025, then the taxpayer will be entitled to claim the credit when they place the vehicle in service (namely, when they take possession of the vehicle), even if the vehicle is placed in service after September 30, 2025,"" the IRS said.

If delivery occurs after the deadline, EV buyers should receive a ""time of sale report"" from the dealer when they take possession and then submit the report via the Energy Credits Online portal.

Essentially, buyers can sign on the dotted line and pay a deposit to meet the requirements, and manufacturers can backfill these orders without needing to have inventory on hand, which means more EV sales for automakers.

In its latest report, Cox Automotive said July new EV sales surged 26.4% month over month and 19.7% year over year to 130,082 units, lifting market share to 9.1%. Cox said July was the second-highest monthly total on record, with 11 brands posting their best EV sales of the year as buyers gobbled up EVs ahead of tax credit expiration.

Cox found that new EV days of supply fell sharply to 87 days, down 32.3% month over month and 49% year over year. This indicates that a supply crunch would have been a problem for EV buyers and manufacturers as August and September sales heat up.

""With the IRA tax credit set to expire at the end of September, urgency is likely to remain high, positioning the EV market for continued strength through the remainder of Q3,"" Cox director of insights Stephanie Valdez Streaty wrote in the report.

Indeed, once the tax credit is gone and delivery is completed, EV sales will likely take a steep dive in Q4.

Late last year, in a report dubbed ""The Effects of 'Buy American': Electric Vehicles and the Inflation Reduction Act,"" researchers Joseph Shapiro, Hunt Allcott, and Felix Tintelnot quantified the tax credit's effect.

After constructing a model and running a simulation, the report found that EV sales in the US would drop 27% if the federal EV tax credit were removed compared to a scenario with the EV tax credit in place. The report found this would lead to EV registrations falling to 867,000 EVs from 1.184 million with the tax credit in place — or 317,000 fewer EVs.

Losing the EV tax credit is a ""substantial change,"" Shapiro told Yahoo Finance at the time. ""It's a rapidly growing market and relatively new technology, but [loss of the EV tax credit] is not trivial. I mean, $7,500 is not trivial,” Shapiro added.

Lake Charles LNG deals

Energy Transfer’s Lake Charles LNG project seeks to convert its existing regasification terminal to an LNG export facility.

It has a proposed liquefaction capacity of 16.45 mtpa and includes three trains and also modifications to the Trunkline Gas pipeline.

In September last year, Energy Transfer executed an EPC agreement with a joint venture of France’s Technip Energies and US-based KBR.

Earlier this year, Lake Charles LNG signed a heads of agreement with MidOcean Energy, the LNG unit of US-based energy investor EIG, which provides a non-binding framework for the joint development of the LNG project.

Pursuant to the HoA, MidOcean would commit to fund 30 percent of the construction cost and be entitled to 30 percent of the LNG production, or about five mtpa.

In addition, Lake Charles signed twenty-year SPAs with Kyushu Electric Power and Chevron.

Energy Transfer’s management recently said that the company is in advanced discussions for the sale of the remaining offtake volumes from its proposed LNG export facility.

“On the marketing side, we’re in advanced discussions with multiple parties for our remaining capacity and are getting close to our target of 15 million metric tons per annum,” Energy Transfer’s co-CEO, Tom Long, said during the company’s earnings call.

“Some of our potential offtake customers are also interested in equity in the project, which if concluded would reduce our external financing requirements,” he said.

Why This EPC Contract is a Game-Changer

EPC contracts streamline the entire development cycle - covering engineering, procurement, and construction - with one partner responsible for delivering a complete, operational project. For Green Rain shareholders, this translates into:

Faster project delivery with clear timelines and budgets.

Lower risk exposure, thanks to Wallace Energy's turnkey model.

Scalability, as Wallace is licensed in over 40 states and can replicate Green Rain's projects nationwide.

Bankability, as lenders prefer EPC-backed projects with single-point accountability.

""This EPC contract represents the beginning of a new growth era for Green Rain Energy,"" said Alfredo Papadakis, CEO of Green Rain Energy Holdings. ""By partnering with Wallace Energy, we're not only completing our Greece, NY solar farm but also building the foundation for a nationwide EV charging network that positions us at the center of the clean energy transition. This is the kind of high-impact execution our shareholders have been waiting for.""

Project Timelines & Market Impact

Greece, NY Solar Farm: Construction is expected to begin immediately following the EPC contract signing, with commercial operations anticipated in Q2 2026. The facility is expected to deliver 20 megawatts (MW) of renewable capacity, generating clean electricity for approximately 4,000 homes annually. Estimated annual revenue from this project could exceed $5 million.

Rochester, NY EV Charging & Hotel Sites: First installations are projected to go live by Q1 2026, with additional phases rolling out across New York State through 2026-2027. Initial deployments will include 150 fast-charging ports, generating an estimated $4-6 million in annual revenue based on current market utilization rates.

Nationwide EV Expansion: Green Rain and Wallace Energy plan to launch EV charging projects in multiple states beginning in mid-2026, scaling to 1,000 charging ports nationwide by 2027. This network is projected to support over 250,000 charging sessions annually and create potential revenue streams in excess of $25-30 million per year once fully operational.

Positioning in a Multi-Billion Dollar Market

Green Rain's expansion strategy comes at a pivotal moment for the clean energy industry:

The global EV charging infrastructure market is projected to surpass $100 billion by 2030, with North America representing one of the fastest-growing regions.

The U.S. solar energy market is expected to expand from $33 billion in 2024 to over $70 billion by 2032, driven by federal incentives, state mandates, and rising consumer demand.

By integrating solar power generation with EV charging infrastructure, Green Rain Energy is uniquely positioned to capture synergistic revenue streams and establish itself as a vertically aligned clean-energy provider.

""Our strategy is clear,"" added Papadakis. ""We are targeting two of the fastest-growing sectors in the energy transition - solar and EV charging - and aligning them under one roof. This dual approach allows us to maximize revenues, reduce costs, and deliver shareholder value at a scale that few small-cap companies can match.""

Stock Dividend Update

In addition to this transformative EPC contract, the Green Rain Energy Holdings Board of Directors has approved a special stock dividend for its shareholders:

Record Date: October 28, 2025

Dividend Terms: Shareholders of record will receive 100 shares of common stock for every 1,000 shares held (pending customary approval by FINRA).

Distribution: No fractional shares will be issued; holdings will be rounded up to the nearest whole share.

This stock dividend underscores the Company's commitment to shareholder value, while also enhancing liquidity in the marketplace. Green Rain expects the dividend to qualify as tax-free to U.S. stockholders for federal income tax purposes.

""This dividend is more than just a reward - it's a signal of confidence in our strategy and our future,"" said Papadakis. ""We are building a company designed to thrive at the intersection of renewable energy and EV infrastructure, and we want our investors to grow with us every step of the way.""

3 Alternative Energy Stocks to Watch Talen Energy: Based in Houston, TX, the company owns and operates power infrastructure principally in the United States.","EV Market Boom to Boost Clean Energy: Electric vehicles (EVs) are playing a pivotal role in decarbonizing the transportation sector. Rising electrification, supported by government subsidies, tax rebates, grants, and incentives like carpool lane access, is encouraging more people to switch from gasoline-powered vehicles to EVs in the United States. Additionally, declining battery costs are further driving growth in the U.S. EV market.

Consequently, 408,688 EVs were registered in the United States during the third quarter of 2024, marking an 8% increase year over year (according to data from the Alliance for Automotive Innovation. Looking ahead, the U.S. EV market size is expected to register a CAGR of 10.5% between 2025 and 2029, as estimated by a report from Statista. Such an impressive outlook bolsters the prospects of clean energy stocks, which offer the largest electric vehicle charging network in the United States.

Rising Costs & Impact of Tariffs and OBBA: The steadily rising cost of renewable installations in recent times has been posing a significant challenge for clean energy installers. In particular, the rising price of steel, which is used to make giant wind turbine blades, has been pushing up the cost of wind installation lately.

The heightened import tariff recently implemented by the U.S. government in early 2025 has put increased cost pressure on the wind industry. Notably, America's wind turbine orders declined 50% in the first half of 2025 compared to last year, reaching their lowest level since 2020, caused primarily by tariffs and policy uncertainty.

In addition to this, the passage of the One Big Beautiful Act (""OBBBA"") in July 2025 struck another big blow to the clean energy industry's growth trajectory. The OBBBA brought significant changes to the tax credits available for eligible clean energy components and facilities, including terminating the advanced manufacturing production tax credit for wind components sold after Dec. 31, 2027.

To this end, Wood Mackenzie's modeling shows that the expiration of tax credits will increase unsubsidized Levelized Cost of Energy (""LCOE"") by an average of 25%, a more substantial impact than tariff scenarios, which can add up to 10%. Undoubtedly, the near-term growth of alternative energy stocks will be affected by the implementation of OBBBA, leading to delays in project completion and subsequent revenue generation.

Zacks Industry Rank Reflects Grim Outlook

The Zacks Alternative Energy industry is housed within the broader Zacks Oils-Energy sector. It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #179, which places it in the bottom 27% of more than 250 Zacks industries.

The group'sZacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates gloomy near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.

The industry's position in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is due to a negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts have lost confidence in this group's earnings growth potential over the past few months. The industry's bottom-line estimate for the current fiscal year has moved down 1.7% to $2.38 since June 30.

,EVs,2025-08-25 16:11:02+00:00,TESLARATI,Tesla set to win big after IRS adjusts EV tax credit rules - Teslarati,"Joey Klender, Simon Alvarez",,,,,https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-set-win-big-after-irs-adjusts-ev-tax-credit-rules/,"Tesla is set to potentially come out as a big winner as the IRS has adjusted the rules of the $7,500 EV tax credit slightly.

The $7,500 tax credit for electric vehicles is set to expire on September 30, but the IRS has made a slight adjustment to the terms of the credit that will give consumers a bit more time to buy an EV and receive the discount.

The original terms of the EV tax credit were that delivery of an EV must be completed by September 30. Even if you had made a reservation or put a down payment on an EV, if it did not arrive and take delivery by September 30, the credit would not apply to you.

Tesla is ready with a perfect counter to the end of US EV tax credits

This put some people in quite a tough situation. As wait times for some EVs, especially Tesla Model Y and Model 3 vehicles, continue to be pushed back due to an increase in demand as consumers are trying to take advantage of the credit, some car buyers ordered a car that was not the trim level, paint color, or interior color that they wanted.

However, the IRS has adjusted the terms of the tax credit to enable people to have a bit more time to get the vehicle they want.

Late last week, the agency said that the meaning of “acquired” has been changed, and now, if a consumer has entered a legally binding contract to take delivery of the vehicle, which includes a nominal down payment on the car, they can take delivery after the previous September 30 deadline and still qualify for the credit.

The IRS wrote:

“For purposes of sections 25E, 30D, and 45W, a vehicle is ‘acquired’ as of the date a written binding contract is entered into and a payment has been made. A payment includes a nominal down payment or a vehicle trade-in.”

Tesla could come out as a big winner here because of this. The company is experiencing a lot of demand for its cars because of the tax credit’s expiration, and now that the rule has been adjusted to include orders received by the 30th as long as they’re accompanied by a nominal down payment, some of these high-demand deliveries could leak into Q4.

Q3 is likely going to be a very strong quarter for Tesla, and questions remain about how the company will perform in subsequent quarters since the tax credit is going away. However, this slight adjustment is a big plus for Tesla and other EV makers.

Tesla seems determined to kick off the production of the Tesla Semi sometime this year at its Nevada factory.

This was hinted at by the arrival of massive production equipment to the Semi’s manufacturing site near Giga Nevada.

New equipment

What appeared to be a massive stamping machine has been transported to the Giga Texas complex. Spotted by longtime drone operator and Tesla Semi advocate @HinrichsZane, the massive contraption is so large and heavy that a single semi truck and trailer were not enough to move it. Instead, the massive machine was shipped to the Semi factory using two diesel trucks and a triple trailer.

The machine was fully covered in the videos from Nevada, but based on its shape and size, it appears that it is a stamping press for the Class 8 all-electric truck. Tesla is a pioneer in the use of Megacasts in the automotive industry, so it makes sense for the company to use a Giga Press for the Semi’s production as well.

Ambitious goals

The Tesla Semi factory is expected to produce a whopping 50,000 units of the Class 8 all-electric truck annually when it is fully ramped. At that output, the facility would be one of the country’s highest-volume plants for semi trailers, electric or otherwise. In a video posted earlier this year, Dan Priestley, who leads the Semi program at Tesla, stated that the company is looking to achieve volume production over the coming quarters.

This should allow the Tesla Semi factory to mass produce the vehicle by 2026. Tesla CEO Elon Musk reiterated this timeframe recently, when he responded to a post on social media platform X about Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates being bearish about battery electric semi trucks. “Tesla Semi will be in volume production next year,” Musk said in his post, which also included a laughing emoji.

Check out the drone operator’s recent footage of the Tesla Semi factory in the video below.

Elon Musk is taking a firmer stance in the vision vs lidar debate for autonomous driving. In his more recent comments, the CEO is not just stating that using sensors like lidar is unnecessary to achieve self-driving.

Musk is stating that using lidar actually makes self-driving cars more dangerous.

Uber CEO’s comments

During a recent interview, Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi shared his thoughts on the autonomy race. As per the CEO, he is still inclined to believe that Waymo’s approach, which requires outfitting cars with equipment such as lidar and radar, is necessary to achieve superhuman levels of safety for self-driving cars.

“Solid state LiDAR is $500. Why not include lidar as well in order to achieve super human safety. All of our partners are using a combination of camera, radar and LiDAR, and I personally think that’s the right solution, but I could be proven wrong,” the Uber CEO noted.

Elon Musk’s rebuttal

In response to the Uber CEO’s comments, Elon Musk stated that lidar and radar, at least based on Tesla’s experience, actually reduce safety instead of improving it. As per the Tesla CEO, there are times when sensors such as lidar and radar disagree with cameras. This creates sensor ambiguity, which, in turn, creates more risk. Musk then noted that Tesla has seen an improvement in safety once the company focused on a vision only approach.

“Lidar and radar reduce safety due to sensor contention. If lidars/radars disagree with cameras, which one wins? This sensor ambiguity causes increased, not decreased, risk. That’s why Waymos can’t drive on highways. We turned off the radars in Teslas to increase safety. Cameras ftw,’ Musk wrote.

Musk’s comments are quite notable as Tesla was able to launch a dedicated Robotaxi pilot in Austin and the Bay Area using its vision-based autonomous systems. The same is true for FSD, which is quickly becoming notably better than humans in driving.

It appears that the Tesla Model Y L has been sold out in China for September 2025. This was hinted at in Tesla China’s configurator for the all-electric crossover.

Model Y L deliveries

Since the Model Y L’s official launch earlier this month, Tesla has been pretty consistent in the idea that the extended wheelbase variant of its best-selling vehicle will see its first deliveries sometime in September. This was quite an impressive timeframe for Tesla, considering that the Model Y L has only been launched this August.

Nevertheless, both Tesla China’s Model Y configurator and comments from company executives have noted that the vehicle will see its first customer deliveries in September. “Tesla cars are fun to drive alone, whether you have children or how many children, this car can meet all your needs. We will deliver in September and wait for you to get in the car,” Tesla China VP Grace Tao wrote on Weibo.

October 2025 deliveries

A look at Tesla China’s order page as of writing shows that the earliest deliveries for the Model Y L, if ordered today, would be October 2025 instead. This suggests that the six-seat Model Y variant has effectively been sold out for September. This bodes well for the vehicle, and it suggests that it is a variant that may be able to raise Tesla’s sales numbers in China, as well as territories where the Model Y L could be exported.

Rumors of the Model Y L’s strong sales have been abounding. After the vehicle’s launch, industry watchers estimated that Tesla China has received over 35,000 orders for the Model Y L in just one day. Later estimates suggested that the Model Y L’s orders have breached the 50,000 mark.

A nearly complete wind farm off the coast of Rhode Island and Connecticut faces an uncertain future as the states’ Democratic governors, members of Congress and union workers are calling Monday for the Trump administration to let construction resume.

The administration halted construction on the Revolution Wind project last week, saying the federal government needs to review the project and address national security concerns. It did not specify what those concerns are. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management said Monday it’s not commenting further at this time.

The Democratic politicians are getting involved because stopping work on Revolution Wind threatens local jobs and their states’ climate goals, and could drive up electricity prices throughout the region. Officials say the project is 80% complete, with all the underwater foundations and 45 out of 65 turbines already installed.

Large, ocean-based wind farms are the linchpin of government plans to shift to renewable energy, particularly in East Coast states with large populations and limited land for wind turbines or solar arrays.

President Donald Trump has made sweeping strides to prioritize fossil fuels and hinder renewable energy projects. Those include reviewing wind and solar energy permits, canceling plans to use large areas of federal waters for new offshore wind development and stopping work on another offshore wind project under construction for New York, although construction was later allowed to resume.

Rhode Island Gov. Dan McKee is headed to North Kingstown, where the logistics and operations hub for the project is located. The governor has said the wind farm is critical to the region’s economy and energy future. Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont spoke at State Pier in New London, where components for the Revolution Wind project are kept before being taken out to sea.

U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut said during Monday’s press conference that it was “nuts, crazy, insane” to halt a fully approved project that would save ratepayers hundreds of millions of dollars. He expects the courts to agree that the Trump administration acted unlawfully when it stopped the project based on “secret information.”

Revolution Wind is expected to be Rhode Island and Connecticut’s first large offshore wind farm, capable of powering more than 350,000 homes. Power would be provided at a rate of 9.8 cents per kilowatt hour, locked in for 20 years. That is cheaper than the average cost of electricity in New England.

About 1,000 union members have been working on Revolution Wind, and those jobs are now at risk.

“This isn’t work that anybody can do,” Keith Brothers, business manager of the Connecticut Laborers’ District Council, said about the specialized skills the workers on this project have. “We’ve taken people from the military, we’ve placed them on jobs on this specific site, that’s important.”

A statement from North America’s Building Trades Unions was more direct: “President Donald Trump just fired 1,000 of our members.”

The developer, Danish energy company Orsted, is evaluating the financial impact of stopping construction and considering legal proceedings.

The project site is more than 15 miles (24 kilometers) south of the Rhode Island coast, 32 miles (51 kilometers) southeast of the Connecticut coast and 12 miles (19 kilometers) southwest of Martha’s Vineyard. Rhode Island is already home to one offshore wind farm in state waters, the five-turbine Block Island Wind Farm.

The Trump administration previously stopped work on Empire Wind, the New York offshore wind project. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said it appeared former President Joe Biden’s administration had “rushed through” the approvals, although the developer Equinor spent seven years obtaining permits. Construction was allowed to resume in May after two of the state’s Democratic leaders, U.S. Sen. Chuck Schumer and Gov. Kathy Hochul, intervened.

A nearly complete wind farm off the coast of Rhode Island and Connecticut faces an uncertain future as the states’ Democratic governors, members of Congress and union workers are calling Monday for the Trump administration to let construction resume.

The administration halted construction on the Revolution Wind project last week, saying the federal government needs to review the project and address national security concerns. It did not specify what those concerns are. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management said Monday it’s not commenting further at this time.

The Democratic politicians are getting involved because stopping work on Revolution Wind threatens local jobs and their states’ climate goals, and could drive up electricity prices throughout the region. Officials say the project is 80% complete, with all the underwater foundations and 45 out of 65 turbines already installed.

Large, ocean-based wind farms are the linchpin of government plans to shift to renewable energy, particularly in East Coast states with large populations and limited land for wind turbines or solar arrays.

President Donald Trump has made sweeping strides to prioritize fossil fuels and hinder renewable energy projects. Those include reviewing wind and solar energy permits, canceling plans to use large areas of federal waters for new offshore wind development and stopping work on another offshore wind project under construction for New York, although construction was later allowed to resume.

Rhode Island Gov. Dan McKee is headed to North Kingstown, where the logistics and operations hub for the project is located. The governor has said the wind farm is critical to the region’s economy and energy future. Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont spoke at State Pier in New London, where components for the Revolution Wind project are kept before being taken out to sea.

U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut said during Monday’s press conference that it was “nuts, crazy, insane” to halt a fully approved project that would save ratepayers hundreds of millions of dollars. He expects the courts to agree that the Trump administration acted unlawfully when it stopped the project based on “secret information.”

Revolution Wind is expected to be Rhode Island and Connecticut’s first large offshore wind farm, capable of powering more than 350,000 homes. Power would be provided at a rate of 9.8 cents per kilowatt hour, locked in for 20 years. That is cheaper than the average cost of electricity in New England.

About 1,000 union members have been working on Revolution Wind, and those jobs are now at risk.

“This isn’t work that anybody can do,” Keith Brothers, business manager of the Connecticut Laborers’ District Council, said about the specialized skills the workers on this project have. “We’ve taken people from the military, we’ve placed them on jobs on this specific site, that’s important.”

A statement from North America’s Building Trades Unions was more direct: “President Donald Trump just fired 1,000 of our members.”

The developer, Danish energy company Orsted, is evaluating the financial impact of stopping construction and considering legal proceedings.

The project site is more than 15 miles (24 kilometers) south of the Rhode Island coast, 32 miles (51 kilometers) southeast of the Connecticut coast and 12 miles (19 kilometers) southwest of Martha’s Vineyard. Rhode Island is already home to one offshore wind farm in state waters, the five-turbine Block Island Wind Farm.

The Trump administration previously stopped work on Empire Wind, the New York offshore wind project. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said it appeared former President Joe Biden’s administration had “rushed through” the approvals, although the developer Equinor spent seven years obtaining permits.

President Donald Trump’s energy policy is utterly screwed up; if you assume America’s interests, and not pleasing his fossil fuel friends, is the objective.

This came to the fore when trade adviser Peter Navarro hollered at India for buying Russian oil. Navarro called the purchases “opportunistic and deeply corrosive” of efforts to isolate Russia and curb Vladimir Putin’s war machine. Oh, is Trump isolating Putin? Could have fooled us.

Navarro is right that Russia’s oil wealth is funding Putin’s savage attacks on Ukraine. If so, then wouldn’t it be in our interests to speed the move away from fossil fuels? That’s the path Western Europe took shortly after the Russian tanks rolled into Ukraine.

On the contrary, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum is now demanding that projects “related to wind and solar energy facilities” go through new layers of political review. In other words, slow or kill them.

Energy Secretary Chris Wright has canceled a federal loan guarantee to build an $11 billion transmission line through the Heartland. The Grain Belt Express was to send electricity generated by Kansas wind farms across four states. The states involved — Kansas, Missouri, Illinois and Indiana — had all approved the project. For reasons easy to guess, Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley sided with Trump against the venture.

Invenergy, the Grain Belt Express developer, called Hawley’s opposition “bizarre.” Writing on X, the company accused Hawley of being against an infrastructure project “aligned with the President’s energy dominance agenda.”

As though Trump has an energy dominance agenda, as opposed to a slogan. Does even Trump believe that, well into the 21st century, fossil fuels are the golden-brick road to energy dominance? If he does, that would be most concerning of all.

Trump clearly hasn’t read China’s plan for “energy dominance”?

China now dominates in electric vehicles, solar, wind and batteries. Electricity now accounts for 30 percent of its energy consumption versus only 20 percent in the U.S. The Financial Times reports that China is on its way to becoming the first “electrostate.”

Electric vehicles represent both the present and future of transport. Trump is actively handing the EV market to China. He started by pushing Republicans to kill federal tax credits incentivizing Americans to buy or lease electric vehicles. (They end on Oct. 1.)

Ford CEO Jim Farley recently called China’s rise in the EV market the “most humbling experience” of his career. “Their cost, their quality of their vehicles is far superior to what I see in the West.”

Also gone are tax credits for wind and solar power. As a result, dozens of EV or clean energy projects — investments totaling $27 billion — have been canceled.

Over half of Iowa’s electricity now comes from wind power. And on sunny and windy days in Texas, wind and solar power can supply over 60 percent of the ERCOT grid’s fuel mix. (ERCOT manages about 90 percent of the electricity flow in Texas.)

Trump’s tariff mania, meanwhile, has thrown wrenches in the ability of both green and fossil fuel energy to plan their investments. Interestingly, it is hurting oil more than clean energy. Since April 2, when Trump launched his trade war “Liberation Day,” S&P’s main index for oil stocks has fallen 4 percent. By contrast, the S&P index tracking clean energy companies is up about 18 percent.

Trump continues to bellow about the “energy dominance” thing, by which he’s clearly shown means helping fossil fuels and hurting the green alternatives. He also goes on about cheaper gas, which is not what the oil business wants for obvious reasons.

Want to defang Putin and save the heating planet from environmental collapse? Trump is totally off that case. Only America’s enemies could craft a more damaging energy policy.

“Renewable sources of energy are less expensive than coal for almost every coal power plant in the country,” said Caroline Reiser, senior staff attorney for climate and energy at NRDC.
“The result of this will be higher electricity bills, more pollution in our communities, and a worsening climate crisis,” she added.","Ratepayers will pay billions of dollars for Trump-forced operations of coal plants, groups say

The cost to ratepayers could exceed $3.1 billion per year if the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) continues to mandate ongoing operations of large fossil fuel power plants scheduled to retire between now and the end of 2028.

Most recently, DOE issued an Aug. 20 emergency order to keep the J.H. Campbell Power Plant in Michigan operating for another 90 days. The first order was issued May 23 to keep the plant going until Aug. 20.

The latest order keeps the Campbell plant running until Nov. 19, which will cost $139,402,927, according to an independent analysis prepared by Grid Strategies LLC for Earthjustice, the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF), the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), and the Sierra Club.

“The Department of Energy’s abuses are not some academic dispute. DOE’s unlawful orders impose real costs on real families,” said Michael Lenoff, senior attorney at Earthjustice. “The agency obligates Americans to take money out of their pockets to pay unneeded coal plants to pollute their air. That is unlawful, unwise, and unfair. We will continue to take the agency to court to stop the administration’s irresponsible efforts.”

Recently filed documents from the power plant owner, Consumers Energy, reveal that the cost to operate the Michigan plant for 38 days was $29 million.

If DOE were to extend the Campbell order beyond 90 days and this cost trend were to persist, the annual cost would be $279 million or $178,559/MW-year, almost exactly twice the estimate in the report, according to the Grid Strategies analysis.

In fact, DOE mandates to retain retiring fossil power plants could cost U.S. electricity consumers between $3.1 billion and $5.9 billion per year, depending on how many plants are mandated to remain open, says the report, noting that these costs will be broadly distributed across ratepayers in all regions except the Northeastern U.S., with electricity costs increasing by tens if not hundreds of millions of dollars per year in most states.

These large costs are at odds with the stated intent of the April 8 executive order that directed DOE to issue these mandates, which included meeting the “surge in electricity demand driven by rapid technological advancements, including the expansion of artificial intelligence data centers and an increase in domestic manufacturing” and protecting “the national and economic security of the American people,” notes the 14-page report.

Increasing ratepayer costs to subsidize uneconomic power plants undermines the competitiveness of U.S. manufacturing and data centers, as well as inflating the electric bills paid by homeowners and businesses, adds Grid Strategies.

“Households and businesses shouldn’t be paying billions out of pocket to keep aging, costly fossil fuel plants on life support, but that’s the path the Trump administration is taking us down,” said Ted Kelly, director and lead counsel for U.S. Clean Energy at EDF. “This report confirms that the Department of Energy’s unlawful mandates amount to a self-inflicted rate hike in nearly every region of the country. These dirty and expensive fossil plants were slated to close for good reason: they cannot compete with cleaner sources of energy that are more affordable and better for our health.”

The report, entitled “The Cost of Federal Mandates to Maintain Fossil-Burning Power Plants,” also points out that if additional fossil power plants announce or move up their retirement dates in an attempt to obtain the ratepayer subsidies available to plants subject to DOE mandates, the cost could reach nearly $6 billion per year.

Greg Wannier, senior attorney for the Sierra Club, said hard-working families are already facing economic instability due to Trump’s “reckless financial policies,” and such orders will force Americans to pay out of their pockets “to support dirty, aging, and expensive coal plants.”

DOE “should be finding solutions to provide our communities with the most affordable and cleanest electricity, not forcing them to pay exorbitant fees for unnecessary and deadly fossil fuels,” said Wannier.

Since the April 8 executive order took effect, the DOE has issued two 202(c) “emergency” orders mandating the continued operation of large fossil fuel plants slated to retire.

If the abuse of emergency powers continues, and the DOE subjects all 54 power plants scheduled to retire between now and the end of 2028 to such mandates, the cost of electricity will skyrocket in most states, the report says, noting that the only energy emergency in the U.S. is the failure to transition fast enough to clean energy.

“Renewable sources of energy are less expensive than coal for almost every coal power plant in the country,” said Caroline Reiser, senior staff attorney for climate and energy at NRDC. “The Department of Energy’s orders and the president’s executive order are a political takeover of the electricity grid, granting the secretary of energy the authority to override markets, states, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, and the North American Electric Reliability Corporation to bolster uneconomic and polluting fossil fuels.

“The result of this will be higher electricity bills, more pollution in our communities, and a worsening climate crisis,” she added.",https://dailyenergyinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/shutterstock_64949560-2.jpg,N,,2025-08-25 12:16:08.403568

The comment follows mounting reports of dwindling Model Y inventory nationwide where Tesla shareholder and content creator Sawyer Merritt reported that inventory for the new Model Y “is running very low across the U.S. Some areas”

Merritt added on Monday that in Austin, Texas, Tesla‘s webiste is “showing zero new Model Y inventory within a 200 mile radius as people rush to take advantage of the $7,500 federal EV credit before it expires on September 30th.”

The potential price increase comes amid an industry-wide sales push across the US EV industry as the brands look to lock in customer orders before the incentive deadline.

Late last week, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) issued updated guidance clarifying how consumers and businesses can still secure eligibility for federal electric-vehicle tax credits set to expire at the end of September.

In a fact sheet updating frequently asked questions on the “One, Big, Beautiful Bill Act” (OBBBA), the IRS said buyers will be treated as having “acquired” a qualifying vehicle if they enter into a binding written contract and make a payment — such as a deposit or trade-in — before September 30.

That means the $7,500 new clean vehicle credit under section 30D, the $4,000 previously owned clean vehicle credit under section 25E, and the $7,500 commercial EV credit under section 45W can still be secured by contract, even if delivery happens after the deadline.

Separately, in response to an X post asking why Tesla does not list its $99 per month Full Self-Driving (FSD) subscription option across all US vehicle order configurator pages, Jegannathan said: “Yes, will optimize the design to offer both full purchase, subscriptions (with free trial) on the configurator.”

Last month, Reuters reported that the company promoted the longtime engineering executive to lead its sales operations.

Jegannathan has spent nearly 13 years at Tesla in senior infrastructure and security roles, most recently serving as Vice President of IT, AI Infrastructure, Apps, Infosec, and Vehicle Service Operations, according to his LinkedIn profile.

While he has no traditional sales experience, Reuters reported that he has grown closer to Chief Executive Elon Musk in recent months.

The outlet added it could not determine whether his appointment was permanent or interim.

His prior responsibilities included oversight of Tesla’s internal platforms, global cloud infrastructure, cybersecurity operations, and high-performance computing systems used in Autopilot development.

Last week, Tesla also raised the price of the Cybertruck’s most expensive trim — the Cyberbeast — while starting to include the “Luxe Package” as standard.

The Cyberbeast, previously priced at $99,990, now costs $114,990 — a price that includes the Supervised Full Self-Driving (FSD), which can be purchased for $8,000 in the US.

It also includes free lifetime Supercharging and free Premium Connectivity, which offers satellite-view maps, music streaming, among other features, and is usually priced at $99 per year.

She raised concerns about the level of detail in CenterPoint’s vegetation management plan and how the costs to transition from a five-year to a three-year tree-trimming cycle would be recovered.
“I still feel that CenterPoint is using base rates to cover the cost of implementing the resiliency plan, and to me that blurs the lines of what should already be done and what is the purpose of the resiliency plan, which is the ‘above and beyond,’” she said.","The Public Utility Commission of Texas on Thursday approved a slimmed-down version of CenterPoint Energy’s system resiliency plan, ultimately approving about $2.7 billion for strategic hardening investments over the next three years.

Texas lawmakers in 2023 required electric utilities to submit resiliency plans to improve grid reliability. Oncor Electric’s $3 billion plan was the first to be approved, in November, and Entergy’s $137 million plan was approved in January.

CenterPoint’s original resiliency plan, filed in January, came in with a price tag of $5.75 billion. A June settlement cut the ask to $3.2 billion, and at the PUCT open meeting last week more was removed by commissioners.

Commissioner Courtney Hjaltman said she wanted to “remove a few measures that ... seem more about replacing materials that have come to the end of their useful life,” and make changes to how the cost of some vegetation management is recovered.

Hjaltman filed a memo on Wednesday discussing her proposed reductions to the plan. She raised concerns about the level of detail in CenterPoint’s vegetation management plan and how the costs to transition from a five-year to a three-year tree-trimming cycle would be recovered. She said the utility’s proposal looked more like an “augment” to its base vegetation management budget and that “the lack of verifiable details for the individual programs leaves us unable to sufficiently distinguish the resiliency investment.”

“To be clear, I am supportive of [the vegetation management projects] but consumers deserve transparency between increased base budgeting and the unique investments made through these resiliency plans,” Hjaltman said in her memo.

The day of the open meeting, CenterPoint filed a memo responding that “increasing the regulatory asset threshold as suggested would leave the Company unable to collect $30.67 million per year in incremental vegetation management expenses required to transition to a 3-year cycle” during the resiliency plan period.

At the meeting, Hjaltman said she was unconvinced.

“I still feel that CenterPoint is using base rates to cover the cost of implementing the resiliency plan, and to me that blurs the lines of what should already be done and what is the purpose of the resiliency plan, which is the ‘above and beyond,’” she said.

The PUCT voted 3-0 to approve the plan, in line with Hjaltman’s proposed changes. It includes more than two dozen resiliency projects for the 2026-2028 period, the utility said.

”These programs will benefit our customers and communities by avoiding more than 755 million outage minutes and increasing our system’s ability to take a punch from extreme weather events and get back up more quickly after storms,” CenterPoint said in an emailed statement. “We look forward to beginning work this fall.”",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/KUUWFfTagGz2GibDfszzyUSP-cWY-LKjZ72UQZoc8uM/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0yMTYwOTc3NTc1LmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-08-25 12:13:47.869045

This partnership marks a milestone in DBSA’s efforts to expand its influence across vital sectors – energy, oil and gas, municipal infrastructure, ICT, health and manufacturing – by leveraging its growing portfolio of high-impact projects to draw capital and expertise toward sustainable economic growth.

As a development finance institution wholly owned by the South African government, DBSA’s mandate extends beyond its borders. Its mission is to accelerate socioeconomic development across the Southern African Development Community through strategic infrastructure investments. The institution’s effectiveness has been demonstrated in numerous high-stakes projects, including its support for REIPPPP and its leadership in renewable energy deployment, municipal infrastructure, water, transport and beyond.

Among DBSA’s recent flagship ventures is its instrumental role in bringing the Overberg Wind Farm to financial close in March 2025. As South Africa’s largest privately developed wind farm, the project is expected to deliver 380 MW of clean energy, supply approximately 750 GWh annually and cut greenhouse gas emissions by about 0.7 million tons of CO₂ per year – underscoring DBSA’s commitment to catalyzing green energy solutions.

In July 2025, the bank joined hands with China Development Bank to secure a $293 million credit facility aimed at financing cutting-edge infrastructure across Africa, encompassing energy, transport, ICT, water, health and manufacturing projects. Just a few months earlier, in December 2024, DBSA also sealed a €200 million loan agreement with Germany’s KfW to bolster South Africa’s energy transition – targeting renewables, grid upgrades, energy storage and green hydrogen to align with the country’s Just Energy Transition Investment Plan.

These moves reflect a dynamic financial landscape in which DBSA is not only responding to immediate infrastructure needs but proactively structuring continent-wide investments that promise resilient, inclusive and sustainable growth. Its ability to marshal blended finance models, leverage international partnerships and support cornerstone projects across sectors positions it as a leading enabler of Africa’s energy and infrastructure evolution.

“The DBSA is at the forefront of financing projects that not only expand Africa’s energy mix but also strengthen its economic future. Their participation at AEW: Invest in African Energies 2025 ensures that conversations around investment are grounded in practical experience and proven delivery, which is exactly what Africa needs to move from ambition to action,” states NJ Ayuk, Executive Chairman of the African Energy Chamber.

AEW 2025: Invest in African Energies comes at a critical moment when Africa’s energy demand is soaring and the infrastructure financing gap remains vast – estimated at some $100 billion annually. The forum will gather global leaders, investors and policymakers to address bottlenecks and unlock private capital toward transformative projects. For DBSA, it offers a platform to showcase its track record, share insights on blended financing and project delivery, and mobilize further investment opportunities rooted in sustainability and development impact.",https://aecweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Untitled-design-2025-08-25T115240.159.png,N,,2025-08-25 15:03:44.345695

The order, signed by Secretary of Energy Chris Wright, amends the project’s authorization and allows more time for Lake Charles LNG to reach export operations. Once complete, the Louisiana facility will have capacity to ship up to 2.33 billion cubic feet per day of natural gas as LNG.

“On the heels of President Trump’s historic trade negotiations, demand for secure, reliable American LNG is surging,” Wright said. “The Department of Energy is ensuring companies like Lake Charles LNG are prepared meet this global demand while advancing commonsense policies that support American jobs and lower energy costs here at home.”

Tala Goudarzi, principal deputy assistant secretary for the Office of Fossil Energy and Carbon Management, said the extension reflects the administration’s broader priorities. “Granting this commencement extension furthers the Trump Administration’s priority of unleashing American Energy, a radical shift from the last administration, whose actions undermined the progress of Lake Charles LNG for years,” she said.

Originally developed as an LNG import terminal, Lake Charles LNG is being converted into an export facility. The project recently secured long-term offtake agreements with Chevron and Kyushu Electric Power Company.

The U.S. is currently the world’s top LNG exporter, with eight large-scale projects in operation and several more in development. DOE said approvals under the current administration cover more than 13.8 Bcf/d of LNG export capacity, exceeding volumes shipped by the world’s second-largest exporter.

On August 8th, Nebraska Farmers Union (NeFU), Nebraska’s longest ethanol advocate submitted their formal comments to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) on the agency’s proposed rule establishing volume requirements under the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) for 2026 and 2027. NeFU comments expressed support for the volume increases and urged EPA to finalize and adopt without delay.

The proposed rule recommends an increase of roughly 2 billion gallons in the U.S. total renewable fuel volume by 2027 while keeping the conventional corn ethanol volumes at 15 billion gallons, and partially waiving the 2025 cellulosic biofuel volume requirements.

NeFU’s comments also supported biomass-based diesel volume requirements and the use of higher blend ethanol utilization. In part, the letter said:

The 15 billion gallon requirement provides incentives for using higher ethanol blends. Although EPA continues to focus on E15 and E85, there are numerous offerings of mid-level ethanol blends for use in flexible fuel vehicles that it does not appear that EPA includes in its analysis. Further, mid-level ethanol blends can be utilized in non-flexible fuel vehicles, and we urge EPA to take action to allow their use under the Clean Air Act.”

Federal regulators see California's colloquially-known ""smog check"" rule as potentially inapplicable to out of state-registered trucks.
Regulators opened a comment period for input on constitutionality of the ""smog check"" implementation.
The EPA said the regulation’s applicability to non-California-domiciled vehicles could be prohibited by the U.S. Constitution’s Commerce Clause.
“The impact of California’s HD/IM Regulation on vehicles registered out of state and on interstate shipping is undoubtably significant,” EPA said.","The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is proposing to partially halt California’s State Implementation Plan (SIP) relating to emissions controls for non-gasoline-combustion vehicles over 14,000 pounds.

Federal regulators see California's colloquially-known ""smog check"" rule as potentially inapplicable to out of state-registered trucks.

Implementation of the rule could violate the Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution.

Truck owners have been required to conduct emissions tests and pay a $30 compliance fee since 2023.

Regulators opened a comment period for input on constitutionality of the ""smog check"" implementation.

EPA is considering to specifically disapprove of California’s “Heavy-Duty Inspection and Maintenance Regulation (HD I/M),” more commonly known as the Clean Truck Check program, to the extent that it applies to vehicles registered out-of-state or out-of-country.

The EPA said it “has substantial concerns” about California's assurances under the Clean Air Act that the implementation of the out-of-state provisions of the regulation are not prohibited by federal law.

“California was not, and has never been, duly elected by the American people to run our great country,” said EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin in a press release. “The state’s power grab knows no bounds. EPA will not allow California to violate federal law, and we will not sit idly by while, in the name of climate change, they raise the cost of living on all Americans who rely on truck drivers and the products they deliver across the country.”

CARB’s Clean Truck Check program requires heavy-duty vehicles operating in the state to undergo inspections to ensure that emissions control systems maintain the same efficiency as the vehicle ages.

[Related: California puts teeth in emission regs with new 'smog check' system]

Vehicles equipped with on-board diagnostic (OBD) systems can be tested using OBD data, while older non-OBD vehicles are subject to smoke opacity and visual inspections. Vehicle owners are required to have a valid HD I/M compliance certificate with the vehicle while operating in California, which they must present to a CARB inspector and/or California Highway Patrol officer upon request.

The regulation also requires a compliance fee that started out at $30 a year but is tied to California’s Consumer Price Index. The fee for 2025 is $31.18, applicable to both in- and out-of-state vehicles.

The EPA said the regulation’s applicability to non-California-domiciled vehicles could be prohibited by the U.S. Constitution’s Commerce Clause. “The impact of California’s HD/IM Regulation on vehicles registered out of state and on interstate shipping is undoubtably significant,” EPA said. “The HD I/M Regulation adds significant costs to operation of heavy-duty vehicles in California.”

[Related: CARB approves ‘smog check’ regulation for trucks operating in California]

The agency cited a CARB staff report that placed the cost of the HD I/M regulation at $4.12 billion between 2023 and 2050, with a maximum annual cost of $350 million in 2024, largely due to costs related to vehicle testing, repair, and compliance fees. CARB also estimated the total direct costs on a typical California fleet (seven vehicles) to be $772 to $2,180 annually, EPA noted.

The estimated cost for an owner-operator/single-vehicle fleet was pegged at $225 to $701 annually.

The EPA said its concern is that approving the regulation “would delegate to California the ability to enforce the State’s I/M requirements throughout the nation to the extent a vehicle passes through or operates within the State for almost any length of time. As a result, an approval would effectively force regulated entities in other States to comply with California’s HD I/M requirements, rather than the applicable requirements in their respective States, including requirements approved by the EPA pursuant to the [Clean Air Act].”

The agency also raised concerns that the regulation would also infringe on the foreign relation powers vested exclusively to the federal government by the Constitution, as it would apply to vehicles registered in Mexico and Canada that pass through California.

While proposing to partially disapprove of California’s HD I/M regulation to the extent that it applies to non-California-based entities, the agency acknowledged that the extraterritorial reach of the regulation is unusual in the context of an SIP, a ""State Implementation Plan."" The EPA’s response would be the first instance in which the agency has disapproved an SIP on this basis.

As such, EPA is seeking public comment on the proposal, including whether extraterritorial application of California’s regulation would be prohibited by federal law, as well as on any ways in which federal enforcement of California’s HD I/M regulation could conflict with approved SIPs from other states.

Alternatively, EPA proposes to approve the SIP in full if it receives comments that “California’s SIP submission sufficiently demonstrates that implementation of the HD I/M Regulation would not be prohibited by Federal or State law.”

America’s grid is under strain. This summer, extreme heat waves have already driven electricity demand to record highs, prompting the Southeast to declare a power emergency to stave off rolling blackouts. In other regions, utilities were forced to implement rolling blackouts — cutting power to tens of thousands of customers in short intervals to prevent wider grid failures.

As extreme weather grows more frequent and electricity demand from data centers continues to climb, aging infrastructure is being pushed to its limits. But the solution to soaring power bills and blackout risk isn’t only about adding more generation. It’s about making better use of what we already have – right down to our own homes.

Households today are quietly becoming the grid’s most flexible power plant.

Millions of smart thermostats, electric vehicle chargers, and home batteries can shift when and how they use energy — like pre-cooling a residence before a heatwave, or delaying a car charge by an hour. When coordinated intelligently, these distributed energy resources form what’s known as a virtual power plant – a network of homes and businesses that reduce or shift demand in ways that help balance electricity consumption.

What sets VPPs apart is their ability to scale quickly and affordably. Unlike new fossil-fuel generation, transmission lines and distribution infrastructure that require years of permitting, siting and construction, VPPs can unlock new capacity in as little as six to 12 months.

As electricity demand surges, the ability to build capacity in months instead of years is becoming critical to staying ahead of the curve. According to the Brattle Group, deploying 60 GW of VPPs could meet future U.S. resource adequacy needs at a savings of $15–$35 billion over the next decade, compared to conventional assets. For utilities and regulators looking to add capacity while controlling costs and maintaining public support, VPPs offer a strategic, near-term advantage.

We’re already seeing the impact of flexible demand in real-time. In California, it helped prevent blackouts during the 2022 heatwave. In New York, the grid operator is warning of a 446 MW shortfall this summer. But if just 5% of residents each shifted 0.6 kW of load — less than what a microwave uses — New Yorkers could unlock 600 MW of flexible capacity and benefit from a much more reliable grid. No new infrastructure required.

Data makes this possible. Recent pilots show that advanced load forecasting and dynamic load shaping — a strategy that shifts energy usage patterns across time and location to better match real-time grid needs while maintaining customer comfort — can fine-tune these energy shifts. By predicting local peaks more precisely and spreading out demand, utilities are able to keep the AC humming during heat waves.

But making the most of this flexibility depends on participation. Utilities and energy providers are increasingly enrolling smart thermostats, home batteries, EV chargers, and other connected devices into broader demand response and flexibility programs — many of which operate as part of a VPP. These programs make it easy for households to contribute by automating small energy shifts when the grid is under strain. In return, participants can earn rewards, rebates, or bill credits, turning smart devices into a real-time grid resource that benefits everyone. Instead of relying solely on traditional infrastructure, utilities can tap into a growing fleet of connected devices in homes and businesses to help balance the grid in near real time — avoiding outages, lowering costs, and building resilience from the ground up.

Keeping households engaged year after year, ensuring devices stay connected, and building trust in these programs is crucial for scale. A Brattle Group study estimates that widespread VPP adoption in California alone could save consumers $550 million per year by 2035, highlighting the real financial benefits of increased participation. These results offer a compelling blueprint for how other states and the nation at large can unlock similar savings and reliability through smarter, people-powered energy systems.

The good news is that data doesn’t just optimize grid operations; it can also enable a better customer experience.

When well-executed, participation in a VPP is practically invisible to the user, automatically timing EV charging to avoid peak periods or pre-cooling a home with readily-available solar energy midday before energy demand spikes in the evening. When households trust that participation won’t mean discomfort — and when participation helps lower their energy costs — engagement goes up.

A truly resilient and affordable grid won’t be unlocked by building more infrastructure alone, but by making smarter use of what’s already out there. VPPs give utilities the ability to quickly unlock cost-effective capacity by coordinating everyday devices to reduce or shift demand in real time. That agility is key as electrification accelerates and infrastructure timelines extend.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/02P3_d6cjSfhRLgpvW53YYCrH59kZf4QwXNjx4B2Hj0/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9BQ190ZWNoLmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-08-25 12:12:44.795039

Public Staff seeks scrutiny of Duke Energy's big-user deals - Business North Carolina,"Ray Gronberg, Ray Gronberg https:, businessnc.com",,,,,https://businessnc.com/n-c-public-staff-seeks-scrutiny-of-duke-energys-big-user-deals/,"The N.C. Public Staff commented in a filing last week with the N.C. Utilities Commission.
These contracts are “not readily available for Public Staff or [N.C. Utilities] Commission review to ensure adequate ratepayer protections remain,” the Public Staff said.
In that event, the additional power capacity becomes surplus, with Duke’s entire customer base helping foot the bill.
It’s better to “have forward-focused guidelines” up front than to try fixing them after the fact, the Public Staff says.
Existing rates and practices make it difficult to self-supply more than 50 megawatts, if a project owner wants the Duke grid as a backup, the Public Staff says.","North Carolina’s top energy-market watchdog believes increasing demands for electricity from data centers, factories and other large-load business customers will compel Duke Energy to accept more transparency in dealings with such customers.

The N.C. Public Staff commented in a filing last week with the N.C. Utilities Commission.

Duke, and Dominion Energy to a lesser degree in North Carolina, negotiate service contracts with large users on an individual basis, building into them protections for the grid and financial safeguards against the risks of abandoned projects.

These contracts are “not readily available for Public Staff or [N.C. Utilities] Commission review to ensure adequate ratepayer protections remain,” the Public Staff said.

The filing and others like it respond to a commission request issued in June seeking information and advice about “how to fairly and efficiently integrate large electric load additions.”

The issue comes as electricity prices are rising at more than twice the rate of inflation, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Average U.S. power prices have increased $23 over the past five years, partly because the cost of serving data centers needed as artificial intelligence computing explodes.

Duke Energy said in July that it doesn’t “believe any fundamental changes to the core regulatory structures and tools are needed at this time.” Dominion likewise doesn’t see a need to change its “North Carolina rate schedules at this time.”

The Public Staff’s top recommendation is that the next time Duke and Dominion ask for major rate changes, regulators insist that they provide “clarity and certainty” to their treatment of large-load users.

This potential includes additional rate tiers, plus fees to guard against higher costs if a large-load project falls through. That refers to the risk if Duke and its ratepayers build more generators or transmission lines to serve a data center that never gets built or is rendered obsolete sooner than expected.

In that event, the additional power capacity becomes surplus, with Duke’s entire customer base helping foot the bill.

Duke and Dominion build protections for this into their contracts, via minimum-billing provisions and “substantial” termination fees that would force a data center or factory owner to keep paying for power after its failure.

The Public Staff says that because the relevant amortization periods don’t really match up, it worries “the current termination fee structure is inadequate to prevent future cost shifts.”

Richmond, Virginia-based Dominion is pushing for additional large-load rate tiers in Virginia, its home base. It’s better to “have forward-focused guidelines” up front than to try fixing them after the fact, the Public Staff says.

Additional rate tiers would recognize that large-load uses vary considerably, demanding anywhere from 1 to over 1,000 megawatts of power and grid connections commensurate to the task, it says.

Ideally, Duke and state officials would also work to make it easier for large-load customers to supply their own power. Existing rates and practices make it difficult to self-supply more than 50 megawatts, if a project owner wants the Duke grid as a backup, the Public Staff says.

The Public Staff’s filing was one of several filed by Aug. 21, the commission’s deadline for comments on the issue.

The Data Center Coalition — a trade group for major operators like Amazon, Microsoft and Google — said the state has to do more to enable operators to get power from a co-located, third-party generator.

It favors continued cost-of-service pricing, with customer classes established “based on load characteristics” and not a facility’s end use.

The Environmental Defense Fund said some demand-growth projections “may be overstated or infeasible.” This would drive utilities and regulators to approve more gas-fueled power plants that are faster to bring online.

For its part, the state Commerce Department favors a policy “framework that weighs large-load projects based on their alignment with North Carolina’s economic development strategy.”

It’s not opposed to data centers, but worries that utility contracting “doesn’t differentiate” between new users that create a lot of new jobs and ones that are just “high-energy, low-employment applications.”",https://images.businessnc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Utility-lines.jpg,N,,2025-08-25 14:03:51.113732

Of those, 63 petitions received full exemptions, 77 received partial exemptions, 28 were denied and seven were deemed ineligible.

For the 2023 compliance year onward, EPA also announced that it will soon release a draft rule addressing the potential reallocation of renewable fuel volumes associated with the SREs, which may require other non-exempt refiners and importers to assume that compliance obligation.

The Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), established under the Clean Air Act, requires a minimum volume of renewable fuels to be blended into the nation’s transportation fuel supply each year. Refiners and importers can demonstrate compliance either by blending the fuels themselves or by purchasing credits (called Renewable Identification Numbers, or RINs) from other blenders.

Small refineries—those with an average input of less than 75,000 barrels of crude oil per day—may petition for exemptions from their annual RINs obligation if they can demonstrate that they would suffer “disproportionate economic hardship” from complying.

According to NACS Deputy General Counsel Matt Durand, such hardship claims are dubious because refiners of all sizes pass their RFS compliance costs down through the fuel supply chain, thus recouping the price of any RINs they purchased.

""That’s why we advocated for an outright denial of all SRE petitions, although EPA ultimately determined that some still had merit,"" Durand said.

Advocates, scientists, doctors, members of Congress, kids, parents, and other individuals spoke out in a series of hearings last week to let the Environmental Protection Agency know how they feel about a potential sea change in climate and environmental policy: the proposed repeal of the 2009 Endangerment Finding.

In 2009, the EPA found that current and projected concentrations of greenhouse gases threatened the public health and welfare of current and future generations. The finding is the legal underpinning for many EPA greenhouse gas regulations. The EPA announced a proposal to rescind the finding on 29 July at an auto dealership in Indiana. If finalized, the proposed rule would repeal “all greenhouse gas emissions regulations for motor vehicles,” according to the EPA.

Day 1 of public hearings, 19 August, opened with remarks from Aaron Szabo, assistant administrator in the Office of Air and Radiation. Szabo indicated the EPA’s proposal to reconsider the Endangerment Finding was aligned with President Trump’s commitment to “unleash American energy, lower costs for Americans, [and] revitalize the American auto industry.”

The proposal was open for public comment from 19-22 August, and remains open for written submissions.

The following nearly 12 hours of testimonies included a series of comments from state attorneys general, pleas from parents and children concerned about respiratory health, and physicians arguing that the Endangerment Finding protects their patients.

The vast majority of speakers asked the EPA not to revoke the Endangerment Finding, and many said the proposal to do so countered EPA’s mission to protect human health and the environment.

The next day, hearings resumed after additional comments from Szabo and the EPA’s Bill Charmley, director of the agency’s Assessment and Standards Division. Charmley said even after the hearings, anyone could still send the EPA written comments, and that the EPA would provide a written response to the testimonies in the near future.

Representatives from multiple religious organizations provided testimonies against the EPA proposal, arguing that members of certain faiths have a religious responsibility to protect the environment and keep children and vulnerable people safe from the health harms that climate change brings.

Days 3 and 4 included hour upon hour of additional testimonies, still almost entirely against the proposal.

Clean air advocacy groups, such as Moms Clean Air Force, had a strong showing at the hearings. Many parents affiliated with such groups recounted stories of watching their children suffer from asthma attacks, heat-related health problems, and the stress of growing up in a quickly changing world.

By our count, at the end of the four full days of public hearing testimony, we’d heard hundreds of Americans speak out against the EPA proposal and fewer than 20 speak in favor. Those in favor of rescinding the Endangerment Finding included representatives from the American Petroleum Institute, the CO2 Coalition, and auto industry trade groups, as well as Kathleen Sgamma, an oil and gas advocate who was under consideration to lead the U.S. Bureau of Land Management but withdrew.

Orsted reports the project is already 80% complete. Meanwhile, solar stocks moved higher.

The Denmark-based wind power giant said in a press release Friday it will comply with the U.S. directive after the U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management stated the company must stop work on the offshore wind project. Orsted reports that 45 out of 65 wind turbines have been installed.

The company also said it is considering options to continue moving ahead with construction through the second half of 2026. Orsted is in the midst of a capital raising effort. Earlier in August it announced plans for a $9.4 billion rights issue.

The Trump administration's decision to halt the Orsted wind project follow's President Donald Trump claims on Truth Social on Wednesday that states heavily invested in wind power and solar energy are seeing ""record-breaking increases in electricity and energy costs.""

Trump added last week that it is ""the scam of the century"" and that ""we will not approve wind or farmer destroying Solar.""

In May, Norway-based Equinor resumed construction of its wind project in New York after Trump lifted its earlier stop work order amid a compromise to revive a previously canceled natural gas pipeline project through the state.

Friday's move against Orsted's Rhode Island project also comes as Trump in recent days has negotiated an $8.9 billion investment Intel (INTC) common stock after ratcheting up the pressure on the chipmaker. The equity stake will be funded by $5.7 billion in grants that had been awarded to Intel but not yet paid.

The Trump White House employed similar tactics with Nvidia (NVDA), prohibiting the company from selling chips to China. On Aug. 6, President Trump and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang agreed that Nvidia could sell the chips, but that it would pay the government 15% of its H2O China chip sales.

Trump fashioned a similar deal with AMD (AMD), in regard to sales to China of its MI301 chip.

Subsequently, the White House and Nvidia are reportedly negotiating an arrangement for what Huang has described as Nvidia's more advanced follow-on to the H2O chip.

While Orsted stock dropped early Monday, U.S. solar stocks continue to perform.

The 27 stocks in the IBD-tracked Energy-Solar industry group have collectively advanced nearly 17% during August's stock market trade, including a 4.8% collective gain last week.

Solar stocks broadly advanced on Aug. 15 after the Department of the Treasury released guidance which made clear that wind and solar projects can qualify for federal tax credits if they have either begun ""physical work"" or a 5% investment in projects by July 2026. Since the guidance was announced, the 27 stocks have collectively gained 17%.

Heading into Monday's stock market session, residential solar installer Sunrun (RUN) had soared nearly 58% during this month's stock market, on track for a fifth straight monthly advance.

Sunrun broke out on Aug. 15 from a sloppy three-month consolidation, rallying 16.4% to 16.20 last week.

Solar-tracker provider NextTracker (NXT) has climbed 19% this month and is currently in a buy zone, slightly above, a traditional 67.87 buy point, according to MarketSurge charts.

Yet, as macroeconomic pressures, geopolitical tensions, and supply chain bottlenecks reshape the landscape, even the most ambitious players are recalibrating their strategies. Porsche AG's 2025 announcements—abandoning in-house battery production and refocusing on R&D—offer a case study in how supply chain constraints and capital allocation priorities are redefining EV sector valuations and investment opportunities.

Supply Chain Constraints: The Limits of Vertical Integration

Porsche's decision to pivot from battery manufacturing to R&D underscores a critical reality: the EV supply chain is no longer a linear, vertically integrated model but a complex web of interdependencies. The company's Cellforce subsidiary, initially envisioned as a cornerstone of its battery strategy, faced insurmountable challenges. Despite its technological prowess, Porsche concluded that achieving economies of scale in battery production—requiring 40–60 gigawatt-hours (GWh) annually—was unfeasible in a market dominated by Asian giants like Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL) and BYD. These firms, operating at massive scale, have driven down costs through automation and volume-driven efficiencies, leaving European competitors at a disadvantage.

This shift reflects a broader industry trend. Stellantis, Ford, and Northvolt have similarly scaled back or abandoned gigafactory ambitions, recognizing that the capital intensity of battery production—coupled with volatile demand and regulatory uncertainties—makes standalone manufacturing unviable. The result is a bifurcation: while Asian manufacturers consolidate scale, European automakers are pivoting to niche, innovation-driven roles. For investors, this signals a reevaluation of EV sector valuations. Companies that prioritize R&D and strategic partnerships over capital-heavy manufacturing may now outperform those clinging to outdated models.

Capital Reallocation: From Manufacturing to Innovation

Porsche's 2025 capital allocation strategy exemplifies a new paradigm: prioritizing flexibility and technological leadership over scale. By transforming Cellforce into an R&D hub, the company is redirecting resources toward high-performance battery development, collaborating with Volkswagen Group's PowerCo and V4Smart. This approach minimizes exposure to manufacturing risks while maintaining a competitive edge in premium EV markets.

The financial implications are stark. Porsche's operating profit in the first half of 2025 fell to €1.01 billion, down from €3.06 billion in 2024, reflecting the costs of restructuring and tariffs. Yet, the company's electrification rate in Europe hit 57%, exceeding its IPO target, and its all-electric Macan model achieved 60% of deliveries. These figures suggest that Porsche's strategy—focusing on premium, high-margin EVs—can sustain profitability even amid broader sector headwinds.

For investors, this reallocation highlights the importance of capital efficiency. Companies that avoid overcommitting to capital-intensive projects and instead invest in scalable partnerships or niche technologies may see stronger returns. Tesla's stock price trajectory, for instance, has been driven by its ability to balance innovation with operational flexibility—a contrast to peers burdened by manufacturing overreach.

Investment Opportunities in a Reshaped EV Sector

The Porsche case underscores three key investment themes:

Supply Chain Resilience: Companies that adapt to fragmented supply chains—through partnerships, modular designs, or alternative materials—will outperform. For example, firms like Envision Energy, which specialize in modular battery systems, are gaining traction.

Premium Niche Markets: As mass-market EV adoption slows, premium brands with strong R&D capabilities (e.g., Lucid, Rivian) may capture value. Porsche's focus on high-performance EVs aligns with this trend.

Geopolitical Hedging: Tariffs and trade agreements, such as the EU-U.S. deal in 2025, will continue to influence valuations. Investors should favor companies with diversified supply chains and regulatory agility.

Porsche's strategic shift also highlights the risks of overreliance on single markets. Its value-oriented sales strategy in China and price protection measures in the U.S. demonstrate the need for geographic diversification—a lesson applicable to EV stocks globally.

Conclusion: A New Era of Pragmatism

Porsche's 2025 realignment is not a retreat but a recalibration. By embracing R&D, partnerships, and a flexible product portfolio, the company is positioning itself to thrive in an era of uncertainty. For investors, the lesson is clear: the EV sector's next phase will reward adaptability, not just ambition. As supply chains fragment and capital allocation priorities shift, the winners will be those who balance innovation with pragmatism—just as Porsche is doing today.

Global progress on renewable energy JLR’s renewable energy initiatives extend beyond the UK.
In China, its joint venture CJLR has completed a 20 MW extension of its rooftop solar array.
“JLR is proud to have delivered these renewable energy milestones,” says Andrea Debbane, Chief Sustainability Officer at JLR.","According to the International Energy Agency, solar photovoltaic (PV) generation increased by a record 320 terawatt-hours (TWh) in 2023, a 25% increase, reaching over 1,600 TWh.

Reflecting this global trend, Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) is set to inaugurate a substantial solar farm at its Gaydon headquarters in the summer of 2025.

This 26-hectare, 18 megawatt (MW) facility, equivalent to 36 football pitches, will generate up to 31% of the site’s electricity.

This project marks the first of three solar ventures planned across the UK, underscoring JLR's dedication to integrating renewable energy within its manufacturing operations.

Expanding solar capacity across the UK

In addition to this installation, JLR is enhancing biodiversity efforts by planting native wildflowers around solar arrays and restoring pollinator-friendly hedgerows.

This initiative aims to surpass regulatory biodiversity requirements.

At the Electric Propulsion Manufacturing Centre (EPMC) in Wolverhampton, a prominent rooftop solar expansion is scheduled for completion in autumn.

This project will feature over 18,000 solar panels, making it the UK's largest automotive rooftop array.

According to the government's Clean Power 2030 Action Plan, published in December 2024, the UK aims to reach a solar capacity of 45–57 gigawatts (GW) by 2030, approximately 2.5 times higher than the 18.1 GW installed as of March 2025.

The plan outlines the potential for an additional 9–10 GW from rooftop solar installations over the same timeframe.

Building on this governmental framework, the 10.7 MW facility will produce around 9,512 megawatt-hours (MWh) of clean electricity annually, sufficient to power more than 3,500 homes for a year.

The combined rooftop solar capacity will meet nearly 40% of the energy demands at the site, aiding the production of electric drive units and batteries for JLR’s upcoming vehicle lineup.

Future expansions include over 10 MW of solar car ports at JLR’s Halewood site in Merseyside, expected from 2026.

""The UK is a world leader in renewables, so I'm delighted to see JLR is leading the way and helping the UK become a clean energy superpower,” comments Sarah Jones, the UK Industry Minister.

“We’re serious about the benefits of net zero, which is why our modern Industrial Strategy is driving growth into our clean energy sector to attract even more investment and create jobs, backing the Plan for Change.""

This project will be the largest in the UK of its kind, featuring canopy structures and solar walkways to offer electric vehicle (EV) charging points and enhanced access for employees and visitors.

Global progress on renewable energy

JLR’s renewable energy initiatives extend beyond the UK.

In China, its joint venture CJLR has completed a 20 MW extension of its rooftop solar array.

Operational since May 2025, this installation now generates over half of the plant’s monthly electricity.

“JLR is proud to have delivered these renewable energy milestones,” says Andrea Debbane, Chief Sustainability Officer at JLR.

“They are important because they directly reduce our global operational emissions and help move us closer to our net zero goal, whilst delivering tangible value today and for the long-term.

“The delivery of our self-generated renewable energy projects across the UK and China is part of our strategic shift to gain greater control over our energy mix against a backdrop of uncertainty, reducing our reliance on volatile markets and global grid infrastructure.”

The clock is ticking on your chance to lock in serious EV savings and dealer incentives

With the federal EV tax credit, worth up to $7,500, set to expire on September 30, 2025, buyers are facing a rare alignment of urgency and opportunity. Dealers are mass-dropping lease and finance offers to move inventory. If you have even the faintest EV inkling, now is the moment to turn it into action.

The EV tax credit is not a political gesture; it is a direct boost to your wallet. According to Auto Pacific’s 2025 survey, 79 percent of prospective EV buyers are aware of the credit, and nearly one in three say it is the sole reason they’ll buy. With the credit gone, forecasts predict EV adoption will plateau at just 8 percent through 2026 and creep to only 12 percent by 2029, barely half of earlier expectations.

At the moment, lease deals are unprecedented: Volkswagen ID.4 leases can dip to levels you’d expect for gym membership, roughly $100 a month with a modest down payment. Meanwhile, Chevrolet’s Equinox EV leases for about $249 a month; the Honda Prologue ranges between $159 and $229; and Acura’s ZDX hovers near $299. Tesla slashes finance rates, Model Y shoppers can snag around 3.5 percent APR, and Model 3 buyers can score 0 percent when bundling driver-assist upgrades. Polestar is offering incentives up to $15,000 off the Polestar 3, exceeding the tax credit itself.

If you are shopping for an EV now, these deals are your open window. The EV tax credit and dealer incentives combined make models like the ID.4, Equinox EV, and Prologue significantly more affordable. If you delay past September 30, these deals vanish. That said, if you are skeptical of EV infrastructure or unsettled by charging anxiety, waiting might still feel prudent, though more expensive.

What is the long-term significance?

This is where the irony bites: just as EV tech matures and mainstreams, look at robust trucks like Ford’s F-150 Lightning delivering muscle, utility, and innovation, the financial sweet spot disappears. Auto Pacific warns EV adoption could stall.

The company figures that about 10 percent of its total carbon footprint can be addressed with the Renewables Acceleration approach.
Mars plans to apply the renewable energy certificates (RECs) from the clean electricity it buys to cover these activities to its Scope 3 inventory, rather than Scope 2, where calculations related to energy used for Mars’ direct operations are reflected.
What’s next Mars hasn’t negotiated a contract using the Renewables Acceleration method yet, but it’s working on the first deals.","Food and candy maker Mars set a goal in 2021 to match 100 percent of annual electricity use at its offices and factories — roughly 2 terawatt-hours in 2025 — with contracts for clean energy such as solar and wind power.

Now it’s committing to do the same on behalf of suppliers and customers through a new initiative dubbed Renewables Acceleration.

The program, launched in April, will use Mars’ experience in negotiating power purchase agreements to arrange additional contracts that cover the estimated amount of electricity used in the production, distribution and consumption of its goods. Initially, that could be another 6 to 7 terawatt-hours of electricity, three times what Mars is already planning to buy.

The rationale: Many Mars suppliers are too small and inexperienced to procure electricity from solar or wind farms on their own. While many large companies push suppliers to adopt emissions reductions strategies and buy renewables, they aren’t transitioning fast enough at a time when climate experts are calling for a tripling in renewable energy capacity by 2030.

So far, Mars has signed enough clean energy power purchase contracts to cover 58 percent of its own electricity consumption, as of the company’s 2024 environmental update. Extending this idea to the Mars supply chain creates an opportunity to cover electricity related to smaller suppliers it cannot engage directly, said Kevin Rabinovitch, global vice president of sustainability and chief climate officer at Mars. Meanwhile, it will help Mars’ biggest business partners focus resources on investments or process changes to reduce emissions directly.

“The most exciting thing about this is this lets us do something fast at scale that can help contribute to this sort of broader goal of tripping renewables and taking action now,” he said.

How the concept works

Mars came up with the idea for this approach three years ago, as it contemplated new ways to cut Scope 3 emissions, which reflect upstream activities at suppliers (such as growing raw ingredients) and downstream consumption of its products (such as microwaving a rice pouch).

The sustainability team studied product life cycles to calculate the electricity use tied to each phase. The approach doesn’t contemplate other factors that contribute emissions, such as methane production at dairy farms.

For example, here are ways electricity is used for a Mars rice product:

Fertilizer production

Farm equipment, such as irrigation systems

Ingredient processing and packaging

Distribution warehouses

Retail stores and logistics activities

Consumer usage

Mars calculates the amount of electricity related to these functions and activities using greenhouse gas emissions inventory data it already collects for carbon accounting purposes and publicly available government data, and then extrapolating what portion comes from electricity.

The company figures that about 10 percent of its total carbon footprint can be addressed with the Renewables Acceleration approach. That’s where Mars came up with the 7 terrawatt-hours number it’s seeking to address through this approach.

The calculations weren’t easy because you have to “crack open” the data, Rabinovitch said, but many multinational companies have access to these metrics. “I think everyone will agree that doing activity-based footprinting is better than spend-based forecasting because you get more precision, more accuracy, more insight,” he said.

Mars plans to apply the renewable energy certificates (RECs) from the clean electricity it buys to cover these activities to its Scope 3 inventory, rather than Scope 2, where calculations related to energy used for Mars’ direct operations are reflected.

“There’s no functional difference between a manufacturer retiring an [environmental attribute certificate] for a supplier and the manufacturer selling or even simply giving the supplier the REC who then retires it themselves,” Mars said in a white paper explaining Renewables Acceleration. “However there is a huge practical difference in that a manufacturer coordinating REC transfers to thousands of suppliers and customers and millions of customers is incredibly inefficient and adds no climate benefit.”

No precedent

There’s no established methodology for an approach like Renewables Acceleration under existing Greenhouse Gas Protocol reporting guidance, Rabinovitch said, but there’s also no specific restriction prohibiting the approach.

“If you’re looking for the answer from a standard that was written long before you had the idea, it becomes a hurdle to innovation,” he said.

Mars still plans to work directly with suppliers to encourage direct investments in clean electricity and other emissions-reduction activities, such as regenerative agriculture practices or manufacturing equipment upgrades.

While important, initiatives of that nature tend to yield progress slowly, which is one reason to assess approaches such as Renewables Acceleration seriously, said Oliver Hurrey, founder of consulting firm Galvanised. “If you look at the process to get suppliers invested in renewables, it is overly complicated. Are we guilty of over-engineering and not getting on with the things we need to do?” he said.

What’s next

Mars hasn’t negotiated a contract using the Renewables Acceleration method yet, but it’s working on the first deals. In addition, Rabinovitch is advocating the initiative with other large multinational companies that have experience negotiating solar and wind power purchase agreements. He’s seeking feedback and hoping to get other companies interested in embracing the approach.

“It’s probably more the sophisticated buyers, where they already know how to buy renewables,” he said. “They’re comfortable with the rules for that, and they’re comfortable with how to sell [the idea] to their business. The only novelty is you’re now covering a megawatt-hour that’s in Scope 3, as opposed to Scope 2.”",https://trellis.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/trellis_editorial_mars_supply_chain_1470x894.png,N,,2025-08-25 12:11:21.520265

WASHINGTON – U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to disapprove of California’s Heavy-Duty (HD) Inspection and Maintenance (I/M) Requirements as it applies to out-of-state and out-of-country vehicles. The HD I/M requirement in the State Implementation Plan (SIP) submitted by California establishes an I/M program for any heavy-duty vehicle driven in the state—regardless of registration. EPA is proposing to deny these actions due to concerns that this requirement violates the U.S. Constitution’s Commerce Clause and this inconsistency with Federal law also violates Section 110 of the Clean Air Act.

“California was not, and has never been, duly elected by the American people to run our great country,” said EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin. “The state’s power grab knows no bounds. EPA will not allow California to violate federal law, and we will not sit idly by while, in the name of climate change, they raise the cost of living on all Americans who rely on truck drivers and the products they deliver across the country.”

Furthermore, by seeking to apply California’s HD I/M requirement to foreign vehicles, California’s SIP appears to ignore the fundamental principal that powers related to foreign affairs are solely vested by the Federal government.

EPA will not allow California to violate federal law in a manner that foists yet another attack on truck drivers and engine manufacturers who provide the food and products we need to survive. California’s approach appears to be part of a larger strategy to drive out affordable trucks and products based on an extreme climate ideology.

EPA’s proposed partial disapproval and partial approval will be open for public comment for 30 days after publication in the Federal Register, and EPA will consider all comments submitted before taking final action on the proposal.

Background

This proposed disapproval comes on the heels of two complaints filed by the U.S. Department of Justice in federal courts against the California Air Resources Board (CARB) regarding the State’s enforcement of preempted emissions standards through its so-called “Clean Truck Partnership” with heavy-duty truck and engine manufacturers.

In February, Administrator Zeldin announced alongside President Trump and the newly created National Energy Dominance Council, that EPA would transmit to Congress three waiver rules granted by the Biden EPA – California’s Advanced Clean Cars II, Advanced Clean Trucks, and Heavy-Duty Engine Omnibus NOx in order to comply with the agency’s duties under the Congressional Review Act (CRA). In June 2025, the three CRA resolutions disapproving California’s vehicle emission waivers were signed into law following passage in the U.S. House of Representatives and U.S. Senate.

These waivers would have raised costs, restricted consumer choice, and strained the electric grid. By passing the CRA resolutions of disapproval, Congress rejected these mandates and reaffirmed the importance of maintaining a consistent national approach to vehicle standards rather than allowing a single state to impose its radical agenda on the rest of the country.",https://www.epa.gov/sites/all/themes/epa/img/epa-news-releases-og.jpg,N,,2025-08-25 12:13:39.453149

The Grayson site is at 750 N. Carol Malone Blvd. just off Interstate 64 at Exit 172; the Sparta site is at 499 Loves Drive, just off Interstate 71 at Exit 55. Both locations were approved in Oct. 2023 and awarded $650,000 and $625,000, respectively.

“We are proud to bring these stations online with the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet,” said Ryan Erickson, vice president of Love’s Alternative Energy. “These locations bring amenities for a smooth stop, including quick service restaurants and fresh food and beverage options, Wi-Fi and a Mobile-to-Go Zone with the latest technologies, weather-protective canopies, clean restrooms and even a dog park. Grayson and Sparta add to our more than 175 chargers among 38 locations across 14 states.”

KYTC said the plan is to open 46 fast charging stations from 11 developers awarded $31.6 million in NEVI federal formula funds. Each site must have at least four charging ports of 150 kilowatts or more, be accessible to the public 24 hours a day/seven days a week and work with most EV models.

Each developer must fund at least 20% of the construction and operational costs and is required to maintain the operation of the stations for at least five years, as KYTC will not develop, own or operate the stations.

“Having accessible fast charging stations located across the Commonwealth is going to make a real difference for Kentuckians and those visiting our state,” said Kentucky Transportation Cabinet Secretary Jim Gray. “We expect most of the awarded stations to be open by this time next year.”",https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/ev_church_sign_ky_2_0420,N,,2025-08-25 12:15:45.442861

Currently, the state’s six ethanol plants consume approximately 210 million bushels annually, representing 40 to 60 percent of North Dakota’s corn output.
Each bushel produces about 3 gallons of ethanol, 15 pounds of livestock feed, and up to 1 pound of corn oil (USDA NASS, 2024; North Dakota Ethanol Council, 2024).

Special to the Farmer

There may not be a more debated topic among North Dakota’s ag community than carbon dioxide and its various uses. But when it comes down to what is best for the state’s corn farmers, Jeff Zueger says there is no debate about new legislation coming out of Washington, D.C.

Zueger, CEO of Harvestone Low Carbon Energy Partners, which operates the Blue Flint ethanol plant in Underwood and Dakota Spirit plant in Spiritwood, and a director on the North Dakota Ethanol Producers Association (NDEPA) board, discussed the impact of the recent tax bill on AM 1090 The Flag.

The legislation, commonly called One Big Beautiful Bill, passed recently and Zueger says it offers benefits for North Dakota’s corn growers and ethanol producers, along with strengthening the state’s role in renewable energy.

North Dakota’s corn production has expanded significantly over the past 20 years. According to the USDA’s National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS), in 2004, the state harvested 1.05 million acres of corn, yielding 113 million bushels at an average of 108 bushels per acre. By 2023, production soared to 543.4 million bushels from 3.8 million acres, with an average yield of 143 bushels per acre.

And the state’s ethanol industry has been eager to swallow it up. Currently, the state’s six ethanol plants consume approximately 210 million bushels annually, representing 40 to 60 percent of North Dakota’s corn output. Each bushel produces about 3 gallons of ethanol, 15 pounds of livestock feed, and up to 1 pound of corn oil (USDA NASS, 2024; North Dakota Ethanol Council, 2024).

Zueger detailed how the bill will help all these numbers stay strong. “Sure, so for us, there were a couple of really important pieces in the bill, primarily around carbon capture and storage and how we treat U.S. feedstocks, corn in particular, in the ethanol production industry. So we ended up coming out of the final bill with quite a few wins for our industry that we got to walk through,” he said.

The legislation builds on the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 and the Inflation Reduction Act, enhancing tax credits that support sustainable practices. Key components of the bill include the 45Q and 45Z tax credits. Zueger explained, “So 45Q is a tax credit that is tied to sequestration of CO2. So permanently storing carbon dioxide, and or beneficial use of carbon dioxide. So converting carbon dioxide into fuels, converting carbon dioxide into fertilizer. So 45Q previous to the One Big Beautiful Bill had tax credit levels that were lower than they are today.”

The bill increases these credits to $60 per ton for beneficial uses, such as enhanced oil recovery, and $85 per ton for sequestration, incentivizing investments in carbon capture technology.

The 45Z clean fuel production credit, extended through 2029, removes penalties like indirect land use charges that previously disadvantaged U.S. corn.

“And under the One Big Beautiful Bill,” Zueger noted, “it was extended to 2029, which was really good for our industry. And then also get away again, with direct land use. So 45Z clean fuel production credit takes into account farm practices all the way to tailpipe emissions for renewable fuel.”

These changes directly benefit North Dakota’s corn growers. By eliminating indirect land use penalties, which many say unfairly linked U.S. corn production to global deforestation, the bill ensures fair competition with countries like Brazil.

“The other piece that One Big Beautiful Bill did was kind of protect the U.S. feedstocks for things like sustainable aviation fuel and renewable base fuel,” said Zueger. “Up until that bill passed, Brazil was going to eat our lunch as it relates to providing ethanol for feedstock for staff.”

The bill mandates that renewable fuel feedstocks come from the U.S., Canada, or Mexico, figuring to support local farmers and rural economies in towns like Underwood and Spiritwood.

Zueger says the legislation also positions North Dakota to tap into the growing sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) market, saying that if you consider it as a 100 million gallon a year aviation fuel market that could be 50% renewable based, that allows for price strength for farmers wanting to sell their corn.

Despite these opportunities, some landowners remain wary of carbon capture due to concerns about CO2 pipeline safety.

Zueger addressed the issue.

“Well, I think it’s why we’d say that as perhaps you don’t understand the safety elements associated with long-term permanent storage of CO2. So, I think there’s some real benefits with demonstrating carbon capture and storage as it relates to long-term enhanced oil recovery.”",https://dehayf5mhw1h7.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/2327/2024/06/21021310/US-CONGRESS-PHOTO-PEXELS.png,N,,2025-08-25 13:06:24.673717

Energy storage continues to emerge as a critical component of Australia’s energy transition strategy. AEMO’s report reveals various storage durations and their effectiveness in meeting reliability standards, providing crucial insights for developers and policymakers.

Indeed, several different technology combinations in South Australia could be sought to help reduce expected unserved energy (USE) and meet reliability standards by 2030-31.

For instance, AEMO states that 820MW of 2-hour storage would be required to reduce expected USE to meet the reliability standard. In contrast, less than half that capacity is needed if the storage has a duration of 4-hours or more – specifically, 365MW of 4-hour storage would suffice.

The report also demonstrates that longer-duration storage options could provide increasingly efficient solutions: 6-hour duration storage, for example, would require 320MW. In contrast, 8-hour storage would need approximately 315MW to achieve the same reliability outcomes.

According to AEMO, hybrid configurations show even greater efficiency gains. When wind is combined with 4-hour duration energy storage, the requirement drops to 295MW of storage co-located with 590MW of wind generation.

Similarly, solar PV combined with 4-hour storage would require 285MW of energy storage alongside 570MW of solar. The most efficient configuration examined involves a combination of wind, solar and 4-hour storage, requiring 280MW of storage, 555MW of wind and 140MW of solar.

If everyone switched to EVs and gas cars vanished, this is how it’d look

There’s been a big push to get more people driving electric cars in recent years.

As things are currently going, it’s estimated that they’ll account for eight to 10 percent of global electricity demand within a decade.

But let’s look at a hypothetical – what if everyone eventually switched to EVs and gas cars vanished?

How much electricity would be needed in that case?

Various studies have shown that it would put quite the demand on the United States’ total electricity demand.

It could account for somewhere between 13 and 29 percent of all the country’s electricity use.

If all cars bought after 2035 were electric, the electricity needed to charge them would reach over 900 terawatt-hours by 2050.

By way of comparison, Americans use around 4,000 terawatt-hours of electricity per year.

However, it’s not an impossible task to meet.

Power plants often hit maximum capacity at ‘peak demand’, which can be a hot summers afternoon when people are using air conditioners en masse.

The rest of the time, there’s ample power to go around, and a lot of spare capacity if demand was to spike.

Because EVs can be charged wherever they are parked, a full transition to electric driving could take advantage of spare power capacity.

Jessika Trancik, a professor at the MIT Institute for Data, Systems, and Society, said that more chargers need to be installed in places people regularly park.

One such place should be people’s workplaces, as this would give people the opportunity to charge throughout the day.

She said this wasn’t just about convenience.

This would be preferable to everyone charging in the evening, when demands peak, she said.

Other ideal locations would be public street parking, parking lots, garages, and driveways.

“If we do this right, a transition to EVs could do a great deal to slow climate change, without badly straining the grid,” MIT’s report concluded.

What else can we expect?

The EV market is growing faster than most of us can keep up with.

As demand grows and EVs become more widely used, we’ll learn more about these cars.

A recent study has found that they’re getting cheaper to repair as they become the ‘new normal’.

Another discovered that EV batteries actually last longer than we initially thought.

And with one revealing that EVs can easily outlive their gas counterparts, things are looking bright for our EV future.

Here’s hoping we just get the infrastructure worked out.",https://supercarblondie.com/wp-content/uploads/Featured-Image-1-113.webp,N,,2025-08-25 12:15:08.872352

“EV charging is not just plugging in,” Zhou says.","Electric vehicle driver satisfaction is more pronounced when charging stations are located near convenient amenities, and nothing sinks it faster than broken or unreliable chargers, according to a new study by University of Michigan-Dearborn researchers.

The research, a collaboration with Ford Motor Co., analyzed about 17,000 Google Maps reviews of EV charging stations to understand what drives satisfaction and dissatisfaction.

Using ChatGPT-4.0 to sift through real-world, user-written reviews rather than survey responses, the team identified 12 major factors influencing charging station experiences.

Of those, positive mentions of “amenities and location,” such as nearby restrooms, restaurants, or shops, were the strongest contributors to high ratings.

On the other end of the spectrum, negative comments about “reliability and maintenance,” like chargers being out of order or repeatedly malfunctioning, were the most damaging to a station’s reputation.

“Drivers clearly value convenience,” said lead author Zifei Wang, a doctoral student in industrial and manufacturing systems engineering at UM-Dearborn. “But nothing frustrates them more than showing up and finding a charger that doesn’t work.”

While amenities and reliability topped the list, other factors also played important roles. Charging speed and efficiency often made or broke a driver’s opinion — slow charging paired with high prices drew especially harsh criticism. Accessibility, such as the number of available stalls or ease of getting to the site, was another consistent theme.

Some reviewers were willing to overlook certain negatives if other aspects were excellent. One driver praised a station as “a free DC charger” that worked quickly, saying, “What can I say bad? It works and can do 110-120 kW if it’s just your car.”

Others weren’t as forgiving. One reviewer called their experience “absurdly expensive” and complained it was “the slowest charger I’ve ever used,” adding, “I’m a captive consumer since this is my only charging option in my apartment complex.”

The researchers say the heavy influence of negative experiences suggests that fixing problems may be even more important than adding perks.

“Drivers may not mind skipping a coffee shop nearby,” says co-author Feng Zhou, professor of industrial and manufacturing systems engineering at UM-Dearborn. “But if the charger is broken, they won’t come back.”

Most previous studies on EV charging satisfaction have relied on surveys or simulations, often with limited sample sizes. This study set itself apart by analyzing a large volume of actual user reviews from a public platform, offering what the authors describe as “authentic and unfiltered” insight into everyday charging experiences.

The findings offer clear guidance for stakeholders across the electric vehicle landscape, the researchers say.

For charging network operators, reliability and maintenance should be top priorities. Regular upkeep and quick fixes for outages could prevent the most damaging complaints. Choosing locations near food, restrooms and shops could boost ratings and encourage repeat visits.

Policymakers could use the data to target funding and incentives for stations in high-demand areas and promote user-friendly design standards, say Wang and Zhou.

EV manufacturers can play a role too, they say. Integrating features such as real-time charger availability, predictive maintenance alerts, and more intuitive charging interfaces into vehicles could help reduce range anxiety and improve the overall charging experience.

By focusing on the aspects that matter most — and especially by eliminating the most common frustrations — the study suggests the industry could boost user satisfaction and, in turn, support wider EV adoption.

“EV charging is not just plugging in,” Zhou says. “It’s about finding a station, having it work, and having the time you spend there be convenient and pleasant. That’s what keeps people coming back, and what will help the EV market grow.”",https://cdn.dbusiness.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/33/2025/08/UMStudy800.jpg,N,,2025-08-25 12:13:43.860204

The Trump administration's 2024–2025 policies have created a hostile environment for offshore wind in the U.S. Executive orders halting federal permits, regulatory rollbacks, and the termination of tax incentives under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) have paralyzed projects like Revolution Wind and Empire Wind. These actions are part of a broader strategy to prioritize fossil fuels, with the Department of the Interior conducting a sweeping review of offshore wind regulations under the guise of “national security” and “scientific integrity.”

The economic toll is staggering. Over 17,000 jobs tied to offshore wind projects are now at risk, with developers like Ørsted and Equinor facing billions in losses. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) has compounded the crisis by shortening the window for tax credit eligibility, forcing developers to begin construction within 12 months—a timeline incompatible with the administration's permitting freeze.

Global Contrast: EU and China as Renewable Energy Powerhouses

While the U.S. retreats, the EU and China are accelerating their offshore wind ambitions. The EU's Renewable Energy Directive III aims to install 60 GW of offshore wind by 2030, with the UK and Germany leading the charge. China, the world's largest offshore wind market, added 5.1 GW of capacity in 2024 alone, driven by state-backed subsidies and technological innovation.

BloombergNEF's 2025 report highlights that global offshore wind investment hit $2.1 trillion, with the EU and China accounting for 65% of new capacity. Projects like the 1.5 GW Baltica 2 in the North Sea and China's 26 MW Dongfang Electric turbines underscore the sector's scalability and cost competitiveness.

Navigating the Risks: Diversification and Innovation

For investors, the U.S. market's volatility demands a strategic pivot. While domestic offshore wind faces political headwinds, opportunities lie in:

Hybrid Energy Systems: Combining wind with solar, storage, and hydrogen to create resilient, multi-use infrastructure. Projects like the Borssele Wind Farm Zone in the Netherlands demonstrate how integration reduces costs and enhances grid reliability.

Floating Wind and Tidal Energy: Emerging technologies with lower regulatory exposure. Floating solar and tidal projects in Japan and Scotland are gaining traction, offering predictable returns in uncertain policy climates.

Global Diversification: Focusing on regions with stable regulatory frameworks. The EU's streamlined permitting and China's state-driven growth provide safer havens for long-term capital.

Investment Advice: Prioritize Resilience Over Short-Term Gains

The U.S. offshore wind sector remains a high-risk, high-reward bet. Investors should:

- Hedge with Political Risk Insurance (PRI): Mitigate regulatory shocks in volatile markets.

- Target Infrastructure-Ready Projects: Prioritize developments like Dominion Energy's Empire Wind 1, which leverage domestic supply chains and existing infrastructure.

- Monitor Hydrogen and Green Energy Exports: The EU and Asia are likely to subsidize green hydrogen as a strategic export, creating new revenue streams for offshore wind developers.

Conclusion: The Energy Transition Cannot Be Stopped

Despite Trump 2.0's anti-clean energy campaign, the global energy transition is irreversible. While the U.S. lags, the EU and China are building the infrastructure of the future. Investors who adapt—by diversifying geographically, embracing innovation, and hedging against political risk—will thrive in this new era. Offshore wind may face storms, but its long-term potential remains unshaken.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-25 13:06:29.674350

Indianapolis-based manufacturer will pair U.S.-made steel frames with U.S.-made solar cells, offering developers a stronger module and clearer path to the ITC bonus adder

Bila Solar, the Indiana-based solar manufacturer best known for its lightweight polymer modules, is teaming with Origami Solar to bring a steel-framed 550W dual-glass module series to market. The partnership, announced ahead of RE+ in Las Vegas, makes Bila one of the first U.S. panel makers to commercialize Origami’s domestically produced steel frames as an option for solar developers.

Deliveries of the new series are slated for Q2 2026, with both companies showcasing the product on the RE+ show floor this September.

Why steel matters for solar frames

Solar module frames are one of the most overlooked supply chain bottlenecks. Nearly all aluminum frames are sourced from China and Southeast Asia, and the industry has not meaningfully diversified that pipeline in two decades. Origami Solar, winner of the DOE’s 2022 American-Made Solar Prize, has been working to flip that dynamic with a switch to steel.

Steel is not only cheaper than domestic aluminum, but it is also stronger, more recyclable, and supported by a mature U.S. manufacturing base. Origami recently commissioned an automated frame production line in Arkansas with partners Priefert Steel and DAC Robotics, and it has secured a U.S. supply chain of fabricators in Ohio, Texas, and beyond. The company says frames can be shipped to module makers in as little as one to two days, cutting out trans-Pacific shipping risk and embodied carbon.

“America has one of the world’s strongest steel industries,” Origami CEO Gregg Patterson said in previous Solar Builder reporting. “There is simply no reason for the solar industry to accept the enormous risk that comes with imported aluminum frames.”

Bila Solar’s evolving portfolio

For Bila, the Origami partnership builds on its push to diversify beyond its flagship lightweight polymer modules. Those panels, first shown at RE+ 2023, weigh just 17 pounds (0.6 lbs per sq. ft.) and use a structural adhesive mounting method designed for rooftops that can’t support standard arrays. Bila also manufactures a variant with a fiberglass backrail for clamp-based racking systems.

In 2024, the company began producing conventional dual-glass 550W modules in its 157,000-square-foot Indianapolis factory — the first large-scale solar panel facility in Central Indiana — using U.S.-made solar cells sourced from ES Foundry. That addition allowed Bila solar modules to qualify for the 10% domestic content adder under the federal Investment Tax Credit (ITC).

The Origami partnership takes that value proposition a step further. By pairing ES Foundry cells with Origami’s steel frames, Bila’s new 550W line offers an even higher level of domestic content, stronger resilience against tariff volatility, and increased attractiveness for developers and financiers seeking predictable project economics.

“This partnership unites the future of renewable energy with America’s core manufacturing industry,” said Mick McDaniel, vice president and general manager of Bila Solar. “By integrating Origami’s innovative and remarkably stronger steel frames and pairing them with U.S.-manufactured solar cells, we not only offer a stronger, more reliable module but also provide customers with increased domestic content to facilitate access to the 10% domestic content bonus adder.”

Supply chain resilience as a selling point

Global module pricing remains in flux, with import prices rising 0.4% in July alone. Tariffs and shipping uncertainty have only added risk for U.S. developers. Against this backdrop, products like Bila’s new steel-framed series stand out as hedges against volatility.

Origami’s frames offer not only structural advantages but also a 90% reduction in embodied carbon compared to aluminum frames, making them a lower-emission option for developers pursuing ESG goals. Bila’s ability to combine that with U.S.-made solar cells and domestic assembly positions its new line as a high-content product with clear financing benefits.

“Our goal with Origami from the start was to partner with leading manufacturers like Bila Solar to deliver products that push the solar industry towards stronger and more reliable system performance, support U.S. jobs and national energy security, and ensure American innovation remains at the forefront of the renewable energy transition,” Patterson said.

The order was quickly reversed after advocacy from Sierra Club and other environmental organizations, New York Governor Kathy Hochul, and residents who demanded the project to resume so the state can access cheaper and more reliable energy.

In response, Sierra Club Climate Policy Director Patrick Drupp issued the following statement:

“We have a hot tip for Donald Trump: if you’re worried about the rising costs Americans are facing, stop cutting off the cheapest form of energy. Offshore wind has the potential to reliably and affordably power millions of homes across our country, but Donald Trump would rather take this option away from Americans to bolster business for fossil fuels.

The urgency to decarbonise is clear, but the journey is increasingly shaped by political recalibration, regulatory innovation, and the hard realities of global power dynamics.

Governments and regulators have stepped into a more active role in shaping the energy transition. By fostering innovation, supporting emerging markets, and aligning industrial policy with climate goals, they are helping build a more resilient and sustainable energy future. With trillions in annual investment needed to meet climate targets, public institutions are increasingly stepping in to de-risk capital, create enabling environments, and accelerate the deployment of clean technologies.

India’s policy changes exemplify this evolution. The government has introduced viability gap funding for battery storage and green hydrogen, eased land acquisition for renewables, and launched a voluntary carbon market. Further, the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme has significantly boosted domestic manufacturing across sectors including solar PV, electronics, and advanced batteries. As of mid-2025, the solar PLI program alone has enabled 18.5 GW of module capacity, 9.7 GW of solar cell capacity, and 2.2 GW of ingot-wafer capacity to be established. These reforms reflect a broader trend: climate policy is now inseparable from industrial strategy. Clean energy is no longer just about environmental stewardship—it is about economic competitiveness, job creation, and geopolitical leverage.

But the global incentive landscape is shifting. The United States, through the 2025 Reconciliation Bill, is proposing rollbacks to key tax credits from the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and tightening restrictions on foreign entities. These changes have rattled the renewable sector, with developers warning of stalled projects and diminished investor confidence. The bill’s emphasis on domestic sourcing and ‘foreign entity of concern’ rules signals a pivot toward protectionism. Much like India’s ‘Make in India’ initiative, the U.S.’s ‘Make America Great Again’ (MAGA) ethos reflects a shared political ideology of internally focused development. This shift is reshaping the fabric of globalisation and introducing a new geopolitical trend that is deeply influencing energy and industrial policy.

The Chips and Science Act is undergoing a similar transformation. Initially designed to bolster domestic semiconductor manufacturing through subsidies and tax credits, it is now being retooled under the Trump administration to rely on punitive tariffs—up to 100% on imported chips. This shift has spurred domestic investment from tech giants, but it also risks inflating consumer prices and destabilizing supply chains. The move from cooperative industrial policy to coercive trade tactics underscores the growing entanglement of geopolitics with energy and technology.

Global supply chains are being redesigned in response to these shifts. Regulators will play a pivotal role in this transformation, especially as international frameworks like the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) gain traction. These mechanisms aim to level the playing field for domestic industries while ensuring imported goods meet climate standards. As supply chains become more fragmented and geopolitically sensitive, regulatory oversight will be essential to ensure transparency, accountability, and climate alignment.

These tensions are mirrored across the globe. Escalations in Iran and the enduring fallout from the Ukraine war have reshaped energy flows and strategic alliances. Europe has adapted by diversifying gas imports and accelerating renewables. India is balancing domestic coal expansion with solar and hydro investment. Meanwhile, China’s green manufacturing overcapacity continues to depress global prices, prompting calls for trade remedies and strategic decoupling.

In this volatile landscape, regulators must walk a tightrope. Overregulation can stifle innovation; under regulation invites greenwashing and systemic risk. The most effective regimes are adaptive, inclusive, and focused on outcomes—particularly emissions reductions—rather than rigid prescriptions. As technologies mature and climate goals tighten, regulators must evolve from rule-setters to strategic partners.

Trabish, Robert Walton",,,,,https://www.utilitydive.com/news/utilities-load-forecast-flexibility-data-centers-der-esig/758221/,"“It’s really uncertain what is going to materialize.” The report says load forecasting has evolved significantly over the past decade.
It lays out three main steps it describes as best practices: Establish a base load forecast by removing the effects of weather-dependent distributed energy resources and extrapolating trends using historical load data, weather patterns and economic variables.
Adjust for known new loads, such as industrial expansions or data centers.
Adjust for new consumer-adopted technologies, including distributed energy resources such as solar and battery storage, as well as electrification of buildings and transportation, and demand response measures.
“Establishing standardized tools and methodologies will be critical to ensure that utilities and ISOs can effectively plan for the growing role of data centers in bulk power system demand.”","Dive Brief:

Hourly forecasting and greater geographic granularity can help utilities plan load forecasts for an increasingly dynamic grid made up of traditional power plants, intermittent renewables and customer-sited distributed energy resources, according to a recent report by the nonprofit Energy Systems Integration Group.

“The evolving energy landscape — marked by variable renewable generation, unprecedented load growth from electrification (buildings, transportation, data centers, manufacturing), and rising customer-sited DERs (solar, battery storage, electric vehicles) — necessitates a paradigm shift,” the report says. “Traditional forecasting practices are no longer sufficient for this complex, dynamic grid.”

Infrastructure planners are “not very comfortable yet in the certainty of being able to use flexibility,” Julieta Giraldez, director of integrated grid planning at Electric Power Engineers and the report’s lead author, said in an interview. “Most of the utilities, I would say, don’t really include any flexibility in their forecasts, so it’s a big area of future work.”

Dive Insight:

While the report began by focusing mainly on distributed resources, Giraldez said large-load data centers have become “the latest and largest elephant in the room” when it comes to utility planning.

“Most of the data being used in the forecast comes from the customers themselves, but there’s no good approach to do more rigorous ... forecasting, to be able to determine where [data centers] might go and how they might behave,” she said. “It’s really uncertain what is going to materialize.”

The report says load forecasting has evolved significantly over the past decade. It lays out three main steps it describes as best practices:

Establish a base load forecast by removing the effects of weather-dependent distributed energy resources and extrapolating trends using historical load data, weather patterns and economic variables.

Adjust for known new loads, such as industrial expansions or data centers.

Adjust for new consumer-adopted technologies, including distributed energy resources such as solar and battery storage, as well as electrification of buildings and transportation, and demand response measures.

The report cautions, however, that while structured load forecasting can provide a foundation, “inherent uncertainties remain due to evolving technologies, policy shifts, and economic factors.”

“To ensure robust grid planning, uncertainty analysis and scenario planning must complement load and DER forecasting, accounting for a range of potential future conditions and their impact on long-term system reliability,” it says.

In particular, the report calls for greater transparency on key data center parameters.

“Given that a small number of technology companies account for a large share of global AI installations, collaboration between these companies, utilities, ISOs, and researchers is feasible and could facilitate the necessary data-sharing to improve forecasting,” it says. “Establishing standardized tools and methodologies will be critical to ensure that utilities and ISOs can effectively plan for the growing role of data centers in bulk power system demand.”",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/QdCZx8exX-T3GpobgP7Ya8GYvfrzTDGYRZeMeh2lX-c/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9Tb2xhcl9DYWxpZm9ybmlhX3Jvb2Z0b3AuanBn.webp,N,,2025-08-25 11:06:54.695001

Tesla jumped 6% Friday on Fed rate cut signals, leading mega-cap tech gains

Stock still down 15% year-to-date, worst among Magnificent Seven companies

Cybertruck premium model price increased $15,000 to $114,990

Austin robo-taxi pilot continues with safety monitors required

Technical analysts see potential breakout above $338 resistance level

Tesla shares rocketed 6% higher on Friday, closing near $340 as Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s Jackson Hole speech sparked hopes for imminent interest rate cuts. The electric vehicle giant outperformed all major technology stocks during the broad market rally.

Lower interest rates would benefit Tesla by making vehicle financing more accessible to consumers. The company’s historically volatile stock amplified gains as investor risk appetite returned to markets.

Despite Friday’s impressive surge, Tesla remains the worst-performing stock among the “Magnificent Seven” technology giants in 2025. Shares have tumbled over 15% year-to-date, underperforming even Apple’s 9% decline.

CEO Elon Musk previously warned of “rough quarters” ahead as EV tax credits expire in September. The policy change threatens to reduce consumer demand for electric vehicles.

Cybertruck Strategy Shift Raises Questions

Tesla recently increased its most expensive Cybertruck variant by $15,000 to $114,990. The “Luxe Package” includes Supervised Full Self-Driving technology and complimentary Supercharger access.

Standard Cybertruck models remain unchanged at $62,490 and $72,450. The selective price increase suggests Tesla is testing demand for bundled premium services.

Full Self-Driving typically costs $8,000 as a standalone option. The new pricing structure could signal a shift toward package deals rather than individual feature purchases.

Technical Breakout Potential

Fundstrat’s Mark Newton identifies $338 as a critical technical level for Tesla stock. Breaking above this July high could trigger a meaningful breakout pattern.

The stock has approached $338 multiple times recently but failed to sustain higher levels. Newton’s analysis focuses on chart patterns and historical price action rather than fundamental factors.

Tesla gained 2.9% for the week, marking three consecutive weekly advances. Monday premarket trading showed a modest 0.5% decline to $338.25.

Robo-Taxi Reality Check

Tesla’s Austin robo-taxi service launched in June with limited scope and human safety monitors. The pilot program serves selected customers in a restricted geographic area using modified Model Y vehicles.

Musk targets serving half the U.S. population by end-2025, despite Austin representing less than 1% of Americans. The ambitious timeline faces significant regulatory and operational challenges.

Global Tesla sales declined 13% year-over-year in the first half of 2025. The company plans a lower-priced Model Y variant to combat falling demand, though analysts question potential margin cannibalization.

The clock is ticking on your chance to lock in serious EV savings and dealer incentives

With the federal EV tax credit, worth up to $7,500, set to expire on September 30, 2025, buyers are facing a rare alignment of urgency and opportunity. Dealers are mass-dropping lease and finance offers to move inventory. If you have even the faintest EV inkling, now is the moment to turn it into action.

The EV tax credit is not a political gesture; it is a direct boost to your wallet. According to Auto Pacific’s 2025 survey, 79 percent of prospective EV buyers are aware of the credit, and nearly one in three say it is the sole reason they’ll buy. With the credit gone, forecasts predict EV adoption will plateau at just 8 percent through 2026 and creep to only 12 percent by 2029, barely half of earlier expectations.

At the moment, lease deals are unprecedented: Volkswagen ID.4 leases can dip to levels you’d expect for gym membership, roughly $100 a month with a modest down payment. Meanwhile, Chevrolet’s Equinox EV leases for about $249 a month; the Honda Prologue ranges between $159 and $229; and Acura’s ZDX hovers near $299. Tesla slashes finance rates, Model Y shoppers can snag around 3.5 percent APR, and Model 3 buyers can score 0 percent when bundling driver-assist upgrades. Polestar is offering incentives up to $15,000 off the Polestar 3, exceeding the tax credit itself.

If you are shopping for an EV now, these deals are your open window. The EV tax credit and dealer incentives combined make models like the ID.4, Equinox EV, and Prologue significantly more affordable. If you delay past September 30, these deals vanish. That said, if you are skeptical of EV infrastructure or unsettled by charging anxiety, waiting might still feel prudent, though more expensive.

What is the long-term significance?

This is where the irony bites: just as EV tech matures and mainstreams, look at robust trucks like Ford’s F-150 Lightning delivering muscle, utility, and innovation, the financial sweet spot disappears. Auto Pacific warns EV adoption could stall.

If you live in a state following California’s rules, your car options might differ from those in, say, Texas or Ohio, where federal standards apply.","There is a real-life drama unfolding for six major automakers—Ford, Honda, Volkswagen, BMW, Aston Martin, and Volvo—who are locked into California’s strict emissions rules through 2026, thanks to contracts they signed in 2019. This is bad foresight. This isn’t just a story about regulations; it’s about power, promises, and the future of the cars we drive.

California’s muscle: The state that calls the shots

Let’s set the stage. California isn’t just the land of beaches and Hollywood—it’s a regulatory powerhouse in the auto world. Thanks to Section 209 of the Clean Air Act, the Golden State has a unique privilege: it can set tougher vehicle emissions standards than the federal government, as long as the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) gives it a thumbs-up. Why? Decades ago, California started battling smog in cities like Los Angeles, and it’s been a trailblazer in clean air policy ever since. About a third of the U.S. auto market is impacted, including New York, Massachusetts, and Oregon that follow California’s lead, making its rules integral to the future of the automotive industry.

Back in 2019, things got messy. The Trump administration pulled California’s EPA waiver, aiming to enforce one federal standard for fuel economy and emissions under the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) program. This move was like throwing a wrench into the auto industry’s engine. California pushed back hard, and automakers were caught in the crossfire, facing a patchwork of rules. Enter the California Framework Agreements—a deal that would tie six automakers to California’s standards, no matter what happened in Washington.

The deal that locked them in

In July 2019, Ford, Honda, Volkswagen, and BMW stepped up to the plate, signing voluntary but ironclad agreements with the California Air Resources Board (CARB). Aston Martin and Volvo later jumped on board. These Framework Agreements committed the automakers to boosting fuel efficiency by roughly 3.7% annually and slashing greenhouse gas emissions for vehicles sold in California and its allied states, all the way through the 2026 model year.

Why sign on to such a deal? For these companies, it was a calculated move. The 2019 revocation of California’s waiver created a regulatory nightmare—automakers faced the prospect of designing cars for two different sets of rules. By aligning with California, these six sidestepped potential lawsuits, gained a clear roadmap for compliance, and scored some eco-friendly street cred. It was a bet that California’s influence would outlast federal flip-flops. But here’s the thing: these contracts are binding, no matter what the feds do. Even when the Biden administration restored California’s waiver in 2022, these automakers were still on the hook for the 2019 terms.

Why didn’t all brands sign up?

So, why are only six automakers in this sinking boat? Not every company was ready to tie itself to California’s control. Big players like General Motors, Toyota, and Stellantis leaned toward the Trump administration’s push for a single federal standard, hoping to simplify their lives. Others, like the six brands, saw California’s clout—its massive market and growing coalition of states—and decided to play ball. This split has created a fascinating divide in the industry, as well as some potential nightmares

Imagine the auto market as a chessboard. The six signatories are playing a long game, betting on California’s standards becoming the industry benchmark. Meanwhile, their rivals have more flexibility, aligning with federal rules that might be looser or stricter depending on the political winds. This raises a big question: are Ford, Honda, and the others at a disadvantage, stuck with more costly standards? Or are they ahead of the curve, ready for a future where emissions rules only get tougher?

The real-world impact: Costs, cars, and choices

So, what does this mean for the cars you drive? Meeting California’s standards is no small feat. It demands serious cash for research and development for hybrid systems, electric vehicles (EVs), and cutting-edge engines that sip fuel. For Ford, Honda, Volkswagen, BMW, Aston Martin, and Volvo, these costs are locked in through 2026. That could mean pricier vehicles for buyers in California and its partner states, as automakers pass on the expense of compliance to customers.

For you, the consumer, it’s a mixed bag. Cars meeting California’s standards might save you money at the pump with better fuel economy or lower emissions. But upfront costs could sting, especially for budget-conscious buyers. If you live in a state following California’s rules, your car options might differ from those in, say, Texas or Ohio, where federal standards apply. It’s a patchwork market, and these six automakers are navigating it under stricter rules than their rivals.

The big fight: State vs. federal power is next

This isn’t just about cars—it’s about who gets to call the shots for the auto industry. California’s ability to set its own standards has sparked heated debates. Supporters say it’s a vital check on federal inaction, pushing automakers to innovate and clean up the air. Critics argue it’s a bureaucratic headache, forcing companies to juggle conflicting rules and driving up costs. The Framework Agreements tilt the scales toward California, proving its influence even when federal policy wavers.

When the Biden administration restored California’s waiver in 2022, it reaffirmed the state’s clout. But the agreements mean these six automakers are locked in, no matter what happens next. If federal standards get tougher, they might face overlapping rules. If they loosen, their competitors could gain an edge. The outcome will shape the industry for years to come.

The road ahead: What’s next?

As 2026 looms, the auto industry is at a crossroads. California’s pushing hard for zero-emission vehicles, with a plan to phase out new gas-powered car sales by 2035, even though the federal mandate is no longer valid. The six automakers in the Framework Agreements are already gearing up, pouring billions into EVs and hybrids even with lower sales and losses. Ford’s betting on electric vehicles with their new manufacturing processes, Honda’s refining its hybrid tech and continuing its partnership with GM, and BMW, Volvo, Volkswagen and Aston Martin are trying to figure out how to balance electric cars with what car people want. The six brands are caught in a tough position.

If you want an electric vehicle, I suggest you move quickly and buy one before the end of September 2025, where the tax credit for new and used EVs disappears.

President Trump has dismantled the Biden administration’s electric vehicle agenda, scrapping federal EV mandates and slamming the brakes on California’s aggressive zero-emission rules. This is going to hurt the six brands even further. President Trump froze billions in unspent EV charging station funds, and ordered the EPA to roll back emissions standards that would have forced automakers to drastically ramp up EV production. He also moved to block California’s Clean Air Act waivers—special permissions that let the state impose its own bans on new gas-powered vehicles by 2035, rules that more than a dozen other states had adopted. In June, President Trump signed three Congressional Review Act resolutions that killed California’s mandates for passenger cars, heavy-duty trucks, and low-NOx engines, effectively dismantling the largest state-level push for EV adoption in the country. The federal mandate is gone.

What’s next: remove California’s power over the entire country, as this is against the Constitution. This will likely head to the Supreme Court, and the six who side with California may be stuck holding the bag of extra costs that can not be overcome.

We’ll be watching this story carefully. The auto industry’s next chapter is one you won’t want to miss.

Moreover, with NASA and private entities planning for long-duration human missions, reliable and compact nuclear power systems may become mandatory – as they have been with nuclear submarines for decades.
Not everyone has staked the future of nuclear energy on TRISO.
Weakly reactive thorium is deemed a safer, cheaper alternative to uranium in nuclear reactors – and three times more abundant in nature than uranium.
Earlier this month researchers at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory began their review of another advancement in nuclear reactor fuel that may boost performance at power plants and reduce the quantity of spent nuclear fuel.","Most U.S. nuclear power plants are fueled by uranium oxide (urania), which has a sufficiently high fissile density, exhibited good stability, and effectively retained fission products. Urania is also highly resistant to radiation damage, though it does suffer from being harder to extract energy because of its relatively poor thermal conductivity.

While uranium is found in rocks all over the world, uranium production in the Untied States crawled to a near-total halt after 1980 – as did construction of new nuclear power plants – in the wake of an amplified anti-nuclear campaign that continues to this day. Since 1992, most uranium used by America’s aging nuclear power plants comes from Canada (27%), Kazakhstan (25%), Russia (12%), Uzbekistan (11%), and Australia (9%).

The Trump Administration wants to limit U.S. reliance on foreign sources for uranium ore and processed uranium oxide fuel, much of which has come from Russia. Under policy announced in May, the White House sounded the alarm that the nuclear fuel cycle infrastructure has severely atrophied, with only about 5% of fuel used in U.S. reactors coming from domestic sources.

One reason has been the federal regulatory stranglehold on permitting uranium mines, but another is a 1977 federal policy that bars reprocessing of used nuclear fuel for commercial reactors. A Trump executive order seeks to ensure that Americans can mine, process, and refine nuclear fuels – as an issue of national security. A second executive order addresses “immediate measures to increase domestic mineral production,” including uranium.

Many U.S. advanced reactor developers are testing their designs with Tri-structural ISOtropic particle fuel. TRISO, which the DOE has called “the most robust nuclear fuel on Earth,” also has uses in older pebble-bed designs. Industry and government officials see TRISO as a cost cutter for the broader microreactor industry – and for high-energy-using industries.

TRISO is structurally more resilient to neutron irradiation, corrosion, oxidation, and high temperatures than uranium oxides. TRISO fuel consists of tiny, seed-sized particles that can be molded into cylindrical pellets or billiard ball-sized spheres (“pebbles”) for use in either high-temperature gas or molten salt-cooled reactors. As each TRISO particle acts as its own containment system, TRISO can retain fission products under all reactor conditions.

BWX Technologies, in conjunction with the DOE’s Advanced Gas Reactor Fuel Development Program, just completed a new uranium nitride TRISO fuel production line at its technology center in Lynchburg, Virginia. BWX designs and manufactures TRISO fuel for the Defense Department’s Pele program and evaluates TRISO as a fuel for advanced reactors.

BWXT is the first U.S. company to manufacture irradiation-tested uranium oxycarbide TRISO fuel using production-scale equipment. The TRISO production line is co-located with BWXT’s existing uranium processing operations to establish a vertically integrated facility that spans the TRISO fuel cycle from feedstock preparation to uranium recovery and purification.

Another TRISO manufacturer, Oak Ridge-based Standard Nuclear, was the first company chosen by the Department of Energy to establish a domestic nuclear fuel supply chain for testing new reactors. In making the announcement, Energy Secretary Chris Wright said, “Advanced nuclear reactors will be a game changer for the U.S., and with that comes the need to fabricate the fuel for these reactors.”

In addition, TRISO-X, a subsidiary of X-energy Reactor Company, LLC, is manufacturing its own proprietary version of TRISO fuel for the commercial microreactors it is developing in conjunction with the Department of Defense’s Defense Innovation Unit and the U.S. Air Force. X-energy will be using its TRISO-X fuel to power its Xe-100 high-temperature, gas-cooled reactors as grid-scale energy solution for utilities, industrial consumers, and hyperscalers.

TRISO fuels are hardly new fuel technology. TRISO belongs to a broader class of particle fuels proposed in gas-cooled pebble-bed reactors as far back as 1944 – at the birth of the nuclear age – but are only now reemerging as “fuel of the future.”

Research on TRISO began in the 1960s but slowed after the U.S. panicked and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission smothered the industry. Those early designs relied on uranium oxide for the kernel to avoid internal pressure buildup from the formation of carbon monoxide gas.

There is also a strong connection between terrestrial TRISO development and space exploration, as the same principles of fuel stability at extreme temperatures apply. Moreover, with NASA and private entities planning for long-duration human missions, reliable and compact nuclear power systems may become mandatory – as they have been with nuclear submarines for decades.

Not everyone has staked the future of nuclear energy on TRISO.

Clean Core Thorium Energy is testing its patented Advanced Nuclear Energy for Enriched Life (ANEEL) fuel in its advanced test reactor at the Department of Energy’s Idaho National Laboratory (INL). The fuel has reached a burnup level of over 45 gigawatt-days per metric ton, outpacing the capabilities of conventional nuclear fuels used in pressurized heavy water reactors to generate electric power.

ANEEL uniquely combines thorium with high-assay, low-enriched uranium (HALEU) to offer what CCTE says is a safer, more efficient, and proliferation-resistant alternative for existing and future reactor fleets worldwide. Weakly reactive thorium is deemed a safer, cheaper alternative to uranium in nuclear reactors – and three times more abundant in nature than uranium.

Thorcon, founded by former MIT professor Jack DeVanney, has taken its molten salt reactor design, powered by thorium fuel and manufactured on an assembly line in a shipyard, to Indonesia, where it is already building a 500-MW prototype reactor that could be activated by 2029. The plant is based on technology developed by at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in the 1960s – but long abandoned thanks to nuclear fear.

Earlier this month researchers at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory began their review of another advancement in nuclear reactor fuel that may boost performance at power plants and reduce the quantity of spent nuclear fuel. GE Vernova’s Global Nuclear Fuel (GNF) loaded eight assemblies into a commercial reactor for two 24-month cycles and were relicensed and reinserted into the reactor for continued exposure.

The design uses full- and partial-length rods whose fuel pellets contain gadolinium, which absorbs neutrons to improve the utilization of the fissile content throughout the fuel cycle. Company officials are now awaiting the results of PNNL’s examinations of the twice-used rods.

Another possibility for expanding domestic nuclear fuel supply could come from repeal of the longstanding ban (initiated by President Carter) on reusing spent nuclear fuel – which has left 91,000 metric tons in storage around the U.S. A January 2025 Congressional report says that 95% of SNF consists of uranium from fresh fuel and 1% of fissile plutonium produced from irradiated uranium – all of which can be used in new fuel.

The U.S. developed the technology for reprocessing of SNF during World War II and – like France, Russia, and other nations today – operated some of the largest reprocessing facilities in the world. That is, until the anti-nuclear fervor ushered in policies that effectively brought nuclear energy development in the U.S. to a 40-year standstill.

Meanwhile, China has unveiled a fourth-generation fast neutron reactor that utilizes nuclear fuel more efficiently, reducing waste and enhancing energy output. According to Energy-Reporters, “They’ve built a reactor that breeds its own fuel.”

View the original press release on ACCESS Newswire","Green Rain Energy Holdings (OTCID:GREH), an emerging leader in renewable energy and EV charging infrastructure, announced today that it will be entering into a long-term Engineering, Procurement, and Construction (EPC) contract with Wallace Energy, a nationally licensed turnkey EPC provider. This transformative agreement is designed to fast-track the completion of Green Rain's Greece, NY solar farm and to supercharge the rollout of its nationwide EV charging infrastructure pipeline.

The contract will include:

Completion of the Greece, NY Solar Farm: A flagship renewable project that will bring sustainable, low-cost energy to the region while serving as a model for future Green Rain solar projects.

Expansion of EV Charging Nationwide: Leveraging Wallace Energy's turnkey expertise to develop Green Rain's Rochester, NY EV sites, EV hotel projects, and a robust pipeline of high-demand EV charging stations across the country.

Why This EPC Contract is a Game-Changer

EPC contracts streamline the entire development cycle - covering engineering, procurement, and construction - with one partner responsible for delivering a complete, operational project. For Green Rain shareholders, this translates into:

Faster project delivery with clear timelines and budgets.

Lower risk exposure, thanks to Wallace Energy's turnkey model.

Scalability, as Wallace is licensed in over 40 states and can replicate Green Rain's projects nationwide.

Bankability, as lenders prefer EPC-backed projects with single-point accountability.

""This EPC contract represents the beginning of a new growth era for Green Rain Energy,"" said Alfredo Papadakis, CEO of Green Rain Energy Holdings. ""By partnering with Wallace Energy, we're not only completing our Greece, NY solar farm but also building the foundation for a nationwide EV charging network that positions us at the center of the clean energy transition. This is the kind of high-impact execution our shareholders have been waiting for.""

Project Timelines & Market Impact

Greece, NY Solar Farm: Construction is expected to begin immediately following the EPC contract signing, with commercial operations anticipated in Q2 2026. The facility is expected to deliver 20 megawatts (MW) of renewable capacity, generating clean electricity for approximately 4,000 homes annually. Estimated annual revenue from this project could exceed $5 million.

Rochester, NY EV Charging & Hotel Sites: First installations are projected to go live by Q1 2026, with additional phases rolling out across New York State through 2026-2027. Initial deployments will include 150 fast-charging ports, generating an estimated $4-6 million in annual revenue based on current market utilization rates.

Nationwide EV Expansion: Green Rain and Wallace Energy plan to launch EV charging projects in multiple states beginning in mid-2026, scaling to 1,000 charging ports nationwide by 2027. This network is projected to support over 250,000 charging sessions annually and create potential revenue streams in excess of $25-30 million per year once fully operational.

Positioning in a Multi-Billion Dollar Market

Green Rain's expansion strategy comes at a pivotal moment for the clean energy industry:

The global EV charging infrastructure market is projected to surpass $100 billion by 2030, with North America representing one of the fastest-growing regions.

The U.S. solar energy market is expected to expand from $33 billion in 2024 to over $70 billion by 2032, driven by federal incentives, state mandates, and rising consumer demand.

By integrating solar power generation with EV charging infrastructure, Green Rain Energy is uniquely positioned to capture synergistic revenue streams and establish itself as a vertically aligned clean-energy provider.

""Our strategy is clear,"" added Papadakis. ""We are targeting two of the fastest-growing sectors in the energy transition - solar and EV charging - and aligning them under one roof. This dual approach allows us to maximize revenues, reduce costs, and deliver shareholder value at a scale that few small-cap companies can match.""

Stock Dividend Update

In addition to this transformative EPC contract, the Green Rain Energy Holdings Board of Directors has approved a special stock dividend for its shareholders:

Record Date: October 28, 2025

Dividend Terms: Shareholders of record will receive 100 shares of common stock for every 1,000 shares held (pending customary approval by FINRA).

Distribution: No fractional shares will be issued; holdings will be rounded up to the nearest whole share.

This stock dividend underscores the Company's commitment to shareholder value, while also enhancing liquidity in the marketplace. Green Rain expects the dividend to qualify as tax-free to U.S. stockholders for federal income tax purposes.

""This dividend is more than just a reward - it's a signal of confidence in our strategy and our future,"" said Papadakis. ""We are building a company designed to thrive at the intersection of renewable energy and EV infrastructure, and we want our investors to grow with us every step of the way.""

That means if Lake Charles LNG has not exhausted its authorized export volume by 2050, it has until 2053 to export the remaining volumes.
In April 2025 the DOE said it had removed Biden-era restrictions on requests to extend LNG projects’ export commencement deadlines.
On April 17, 2025, Energy Transfer filed a new application seeking to extend its deadline from 2025 to 2031, which has now been approved.
In June, Energy Transfer and Chevron Corp. signed an agreement raising Chevron’s offtake from Lake Charles LNG to three million metric tons per annum (MMtpa) for 20 years.","The Lake Charles LNG project in Louisiana now has until 2031 to dispatch its first cargo, according to an order by the United States Department of Energy (DOE) granting owner Energy Transfer LP’s request to extend the deadline from 2025.

The DOE decision also adds a three-year “make-up period” to the duration of the project’s export term. That means if Lake Charles LNG has not exhausted its authorized export volume by 2050, it has until 2053 to export the remaining volumes.

“Granting this commencement extension furthers the Trump administration’s priority of unleashing American energy, a radical shift from the last administration, whose actions undermined the progress of Lake Charles LNG for years”, Tala Goudarzi, principal deputy assistant secretary of DOE’s Fossil Energy and Carbon Management Office, said in an online statement issued by the department.

“There are currently eight large-scale LNG projects operating in the United States and several additional projects are expanding or under construction”, DOE added. “Under President Trump’s leadership, the department has approved applications from projects that will export more than 13.8 billion cubic feet per day of natural gas as LNG, a volume greater than the world’s second-largest LNG-exporting nation is exporting today”.

Lake Charles LNG is permitted to export a cumulative 851 billion cubic feet a year of natural gas equivalent to countries without a free trade agreement with the U.S., under two DOE orders originally issued 2016 and 2017.

Energy Transfer says the project, a conversion from an existing regasification site, has all authorizations from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. In September 2024, it awarded an engineering, procurement and construction contract to a joint venture between KBR Inc. and Technip Energies NV.

In 2023 the DOE under the Biden administration denied Energy Transfer’s application to extend to 2028 the 2025 deadline for the project to begin exportation.

In April 2025 the DOE said it had removed Biden-era restrictions on requests to extend LNG projects’ export commencement deadlines. A project for which such a request is made no longer must be under construction or demonstrate that circumstances outside its control prevented the start of exportation within seven years.

Instead, the DOE will review requests “on a case-by-case basis”, the DOE said in an online statement April 1, noting the permitting process is already “extensive”.

On April 17, 2025, Energy Transfer filed a new application seeking to extend its deadline from 2025 to 2031, which has now been approved.

In June, Energy Transfer and Chevron Corp. signed an agreement raising Chevron’s offtake from Lake Charles LNG to three million metric tons per annum (MMtpa) for 20 years. In May, MidOcean Energy signed a heads of agreement to shoulder 30 percent of construction costs and be entitled to 30 percent of production. In April, Kyushu Electric Power Co. placed an offtake of one MMtpa for 20 years.

Terminating Virginia’s Solar for All program would be a costly mistake — and Virginia families and small businesses would be the ones left paying the hefty price.
Virginia Energy has invested time, expertise, and resources into developing a program that meets strict federal oversight requirements.
Whether you live in a rural or urban area — the Shenandoah Valley, the Tidewater region, Southwest Virginia, Northern Virginia or Richmond — you deserve access to reliable, affordable power.
Pulling the plug on Solar for All would shortchange Virginia’s families and communities, waste taxpayer dollars, and set back our state’s progress toward energy independence.","Last spring, Virginia won big. After a rigorous and highly competitive application process, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced in April that our state would receive $156 million through its Solar for All program.

That investment, led by Virginia Energy and backed by detailed oversight plans, was designed to help thousands of low-income families and disadvantaged communities across the Commonwealth lower their energy bills, breathe cleaner air, and enjoy the economic benefits of local, homegrown solar power.

Now, as we are developing Virginia’s implementation program, the EPA is pulling the plug. Terminating Virginia’s Solar for All program would be a costly mistake — and Virginia families and small businesses would be the ones left paying the hefty price.

Let’s be clear: Solar for All is a historic investment in energy affordability and economic development for vulnerable communities that need it most. These funds are earmarked exclusively for low-income, rural, and other disadvantaged communities — places where high utility bills already strain household budgets. The program’s design assures that every participating household saves at least 20% on their electricity costs, which translates to yearly savings. That’s money that could go toward groceries, rent, medicine or childcare.

Ending the program would rip the potential for savings away from the families who need them most. The timing could not be worse. Electricity rates in Virginia rose more than 3% from May 2024 to May 2025, and there’s no relief in sight. Surging demand from data centers and record-breaking heat waves are putting enormous pressure on our electric grid. Every month, more Virginians are opening utility bills that feel like a punch to the gut, and volatile natural gas prices make electricity bills unpredictable. Solar for All offers a powerful countermeasure, putting control back into the hands of consumers by generating power right where it’s used and reducing the strain on the grid.

The Trump administration has said it is committed to lowering energy costs for all Americans. If that’s true, there is no justification for eliminating funding for a program that does exactly that — especially one that is already well underway in our state and so many others. Virginia Energy has invested time, expertise, and resources into developing a program that meets strict federal oversight requirements. Partnerships have been formed. Early groundwork has been laid to ensure that every taxpayer dollar produces tangible benefits.

This is a blow to every Virginian who believes that public investments should produce real, measurable returns for the people who paid into them. Without Solar for All, low-income households and communities will remain locked into a cycle of rising utility bills, vulnerable to every market fluctuation and weather event that drives prices higher. Small businesses in rural and disadvantaged communities will have fewer tools to lower operating costs, making it harder for them to survive and thrive.

The stakes are too high to let this happen quietly, and energy affordability shouldn’t be a partisan issue. Virginia’s leaders should be united in opposition to this move. Whether you live in a rural or urban area — the Shenandoah Valley, the Tidewater region, Southwest Virginia, Northern Virginia or Richmond — you deserve access to reliable, affordable power.

Pulling the plug on Solar for All would shortchange Virginia’s families and communities, waste taxpayer dollars, and set back our state’s progress toward energy independence. The EPA should reconsider this misguided plan, and our elected officials must use every tool at their disposal to make sure these dollars stay where they belong: helping Virginians power their homes and businesses at a price they can afford.",https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/IMG_3868-2048x1536.jpg,N,,2025-08-25 11:07:52.766672

,American Energy,2025-08-25 13:50:11+00:00,Capital Press,USDA: National forest energy projects to 'maximize output per acre' - Capital Press,"Gary West, Mateusz Perkowski, www.facebook.com",,,,,https://capitalpress.com/2025/08/25/usda-national-forest-energy-projects-to-maximize-output-per-acre/,"A new USDA directive intends to bolster the efficiency of U.S. energy production in national forests but timber and environmental groups are uncertain of its practical effects.
The policy means to reduce “reliance on foreign energy sources” — such as solar panels manufactured overseas — by prioritizing projects that “maximize output per acre,” according to a statement from USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins.
However, neither Rollins nor the directive point to examples of energy projects that would be favored under the land-use efficiency criteria or where they might be built.
It’s likely that Forest Service officials themselves don’t yet know how on-the-ground projects may be affected, as the directive is basically a reaction to Trump’s statements, Robertson said.
Geothermal and hydrothermal facilities have a higher energy-producing potential than wind turbines despite the lower amount of suitable land, but solar panels have nearly six times more energy potential than the other technologies, the study said.","A new USDA directive intends to bolster the efficiency of U.S. energy production in national forests but timber and environmental groups are uncertain of its practical effects.

The policy means to reduce “reliance on foreign energy sources” — such as solar panels manufactured overseas — by prioritizing projects that “maximize output per acre,” according to a statement from USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins.

“Under this memorandum, we are putting America first, ensuring that every acre of federally managed land is used wisely, balancing the needs for energy security with our responsibility to safeguard natural resources,” Rollins said.

Among other screening criteria, the directive requires that proposed energy projects be compared with “alternative generation technology” that may “deliver a similar amount of effective annual power while using a smaller perimeter,” thus “destroying less natural habitat and displacing fewer species.”

The directive says “higher land-use efficiency” will optimize “the amount of useable energy produced per acre,” leaving more forestland for “multiple uses,” such as timber, recreation and wildlife.

In her statement about the directive, Rollins specifically calls out solar panels as an example of “foreign energy sources” that would “undermine our national security,” implying they’ll be discouraged under the policy because of the amount of acreage required.

However, neither Rollins nor the directive point to examples of energy projects that would be favored under the land-use efficiency criteria or where they might be built.

The U.S. Forest Service, which is overseen by the USDA, did not respond to questions about the directive, such as whether it’s likely to encourage facilities that rely on fossil fuels and in which national forests they may be located.

From an initial read of the memorandum, “any nexus with timber and forestry is unclear,” said Nick Smith, public affairs director of the American Forest Resource Council, a timber industry group focused on federal lands policy.

Given the Trump administration’s track record, “the reasonable assumption is that this directive aims to pave the way for oil and gas production on national forest lands with little or no public oversight,” said Grace Brahler, wildlands director for the Cascadia Wildlands environmental nonprofit.

Regarding where such development might occur and other specifics, “it’s too early to say without more information, and those are great questions for the administration,” she said.

The Oregon Wild nonprofit expects that USDA’s directive is meant to formally implement President Donald Trump’s disparaging comments about wind and solar power, said Arran Roberson, the environmental group’s communications director.

It’s likely that Forest Service officials themselves don’t yet know how on-the-ground projects may be affected, as the directive is basically a reaction to Trump’s statements, Robertson said.

“This memo is simply the latest effort to translate Trump’s social media tantrums, conspiracy theories, and personal grievances —this time aimed at wind and solar—into government policy,” he said.

Currently, renewable energy is under-represented on federal lands compared to fossil fuels production, according to a federal interagency study released early this year, shortly before the Trump administration came into office.

About 11-12% of the oil and natural gas produced in the U.S. is derived from federal lands, compared to about 3% of the energy generated by solar, wind, geothermal and hydrothermal technologies, the report found.

About 43 million acres of federal property is suitable for wind turbines, compared to 44 million acres for solar panels, though the latter technology has a higher energy-producing potential within that area.

Roughly 39 million acres of federal land would be available for hydrothermal and geothermal facilities, which rely on heat from water and rocks, respectively, the study said.

The project has 20-year power purchase agreements to deliver 400 MW of electricity to Rhode Island and 304 MW to Connecticut.
Revolution Wind is already employing hundreds of local union workers supporting both on and offshore construction activities.
Ørsted’s US offshore wind projects have totalled approximately 4M labour union hours to date, 2M of which are with Revolution Wind.
“Today, the US has only one fully operational large-scale offshore wind project producing power.","The project, which is 80% complete, was due to provide 704 MW of power generation to Connecticut and Rhode Island, once completed early in 2026. The project led to investment in Louisiana and New England shipyards, export cables from a South Carolina factory, and spurred a steel supply chain that crossed New York and created hundreds of unions jobs in Providence, Rhode Island.

In a statement, Ørsted’s said its subsidiary Revolution Wind LLC, a 50/50 joint venture with Global Infrastructure Partner’s Skyborn Renewables, received an order on 22 August 2025, instructing the project to stop activities on the outer continental shelf from the US Department of the Interior’s Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM). Among other concerns, the letter from BOEM to the company said it was “seeking to address concerns about national security.” Revolution Wind is complying with the order and is taking appropriate steps to stop offshore activities, ensuring the safety of workers and the environment.

The project commenced offshore construction following the final federal approval from BOEM in 2024. The project is 80% complete with all offshore foundations installed and 45 out of 65 wind turbines installed.

Ørsted said it is evaluating all options to resolve the matter expeditiously. This includes engagement with relevant permitting agencies for any necessary clarification or resolution as well as through potential legal proceedings, with the aim being to proceed with continued project construction towards COD in the second half of 2026.

The company highlighted the fact that Revolution Wind is fully permitted, having secured all required federal and state permits including its Construction and Operations Plan approval letter on 17 November 2023 following reviews that began more than nine years ago. The project has 20-year power purchase agreements to deliver 400 MW of electricity to Rhode Island and 304 MW to Connecticut.

Ørsted also noted that it is investing into American energy generation, grid upgrades, port infrastructure, and a supply chain, including US shipbuilding and manufacturing extending to more than 40 states. Revolution Wind is already employing hundreds of local union workers supporting both on and offshore construction activities. Ørsted’s US offshore wind projects have totalled approximately 4M labour union hours to date, 2M of which are with Revolution Wind.

Ørsted said it is evaluating the potential financial implications of the development, considering a range of scenarios, including legal proceedings, and will advise the market on the potential impact of the order on its plan to conduct a rights issue.

Responding, Connecticut Governor Ned Lamont said, “This political move by the Trump administration will drive up the cost of electricity bills and contradicts everything the administration has told us. It wastes years of state investment in renewable energy designed to diversify our energy supply and lower costs for families and businesses.

“The project, which was on track to be completed early next year, would have powered more than 350,000 homes across Connecticut and Rhode Island while creating good-paying, clean energy jobs. All of that is now at risk.

“We are working closely with Rhode Island to save this project because it represents exactly the kind of investment that reduces energy costs, strengthens regional production, and builds a more secure energy future – the very goals President Trump claims to support but undermines with this decision.”

Also responding to the decision, Oceantic Network chief executive Liz Burdock said, “For the second time, the Trump Administration has taken unlawful action against a fully permitted offshore wind project under active construction. This time one that is nearly complete.

“This dramatic action further erodes investor confidence in the US market across all industries and undermines progress on shared national priorities such as shipyard revitalization, steel and port investments and energy dominance.

“In fact, halting work on Revolution Wind will drive up energy costs for consumers, idle Gulf Coast vessel operators that have invested hundreds of millions of dollars in new or retrofitted vessels, and jeopardize the livelihoods of union workers. Just days ago, the Trump administration released documents showing it was unable to justify its previous stop-work order. Today’s action is no different.

National Ocean Industries Association president Erik Milito said, “Revolution Wind is nearly complete, representing years of planning, billions in private investment, and significant progress for America’s offshore energy supply chain. Any pause or uncertainty at this stage could ripple across jobs, contracts, and communities already benefiting from the project.

“These projects are not only about energy. They advance priorities of the administration by restoring American manufacturing, strengthening shipbuilding, modernizing ports, and building the reliable power needed to support data centres and AI innovation.

“Today, the US has only one fully operational large-scale offshore wind project producing power. That is not enough to meet America’s rising energy needs. We need more energy of all types, including oil and gas, wind, and new and emerging technologies. Offshore projects take years of investment before delivering results, and stable, consistent policy is essential to keep that progress moving.”

Leading industry analyst Philip Totaro said, “I am curious as to which of the supply chain companies that are involved with the Revolution Wind project supposedly represent a national security risk to the US? Is it the companies based in the US? The UK? Companies in EU member countries like Denmark, Spain, France or the Netherlands? Or perhaps Worley, based in Australia, but with a US subsidiary, similar to most of the EU companies as well. The industry must demand accountability.”",https://dvzpv6x5302g1.cloudfront.net/AcuCustom/Sitename/DAM/169/Revolution_Wind_first_turbine_cropped1_Thumb.png,N,,2025-08-25 11:09:10.043502

The Anchor Center for Blind Children, Colorado’s only nonprofit dedicated to serving young children who are blind or visually impaired, now boasts a robust 128-kilowatt rooftop solar array.

The project in Denver’s Central Park neighborhood was fueled in part through clean-energy incentives, including local grants, Xcel Energy credits and Inflation Reduction Act tax credits.

David Henry, co-owner and senior director of business development for Namaste Solar, the employee-owned cooperative behind the project, said savings in energy bills should free up a substantial portion of Anchor’s operating budget.

""Over the course of about 30 years, it’s going to save them a million dollars,"" Henry pointed out. ""That’s going to allow them to redirect funds to other initiatives to help continue to support all the work they do for young blind children.""

Meghan Klassen, executive director of the center, said because they are 95 percent privately funded, the solar investment is a lifeline. The center serves children from birth to age 5, a time critical for brain development, and has won national recognition for its early intervention programs, therapy and family coaching.

Klassen noted families are frequently at a loss when they first learn about their child’s diagnosis. They do not know where to turn, and do not know what their lives will look like. She stressed Anchor provides wraparound services for children and their families.

""We have a multidisciplinary team of therapists and educators that really meet every child where they are and try to make sure that every child is going to have the most independent and full life possible,"" Klassen explained.

Federal clean-energy incentives are being rolled back by the Trump administration under a policy it calls ""energy dominance."" While state and local incentives are likely to remain, Henry emphasized people who want to claim the 30 percent Federal Investment Tax Credit for residential solar will need to act soon.

,EVs,2025-08-25 13:37:51+00:00,Southern Alliance for Clean Energy (SACE),How Federal Funding Sparked Electric School Bus Production in the Southeast,Serena Golden,,,,,https://cleanenergy.org/news/how-federal-funding-sparked-electric-school-bus-production-in-the-southeast/,"The number of electric school buses on the road has skyrocketed from 415 to more than 5,100 since 2020.
That’s 265,000 students riding electric school buses to and from school each day.
The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) and the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) have shaped this surge in Southeast electric school bus manufacturing.
As of July 2025, the Clean School Bus Program has funded 8,500+ electric school buses in over 1,200 school districts, benefiting about 30,000 students in the Southeast.
Federal investment from BIL and IRA has turned the Southeast into a surprising hub for electric school bus production, creating hundreds of new jobs and accelerating the shift to zero-emission transportation.","The Southeast may not be the first place that comes to mind when you think of electric vehicles. But when it comes to making electric school buses, the region has quietly become a powerhouse. Two legacy diesel school bus manufacturers — Blue Bird in Fort Valley, Georgia, and Thomas Built Buses in High Point, North Carolina — are now responsible for a significant share of America’s electric school buses, thanks in part to federal investment during the Biden administration.

Blue Bird and Thomas Built have each been making school buses for decades, deeply rooted in their respective communities. Blue Bird was founded in 1927 and has been a mainstay in Fort Valley for generations. Thomas Built Buses, founded in 1916, has operated in High Point for over a century.

That longevity meant both companies already had the factory capacity, trained workforce, and supplier networks needed to pivot toward electric production once the money was there to make it happen.

Federal Funds as the Catalyst

In 2024, Blue Bird was awarded $80 million from the U.S. Department of Energy, funded through the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), to transform a shuttered diesel motorhome plant into a 600,000-square-foot electric vehicle manufacturing facility. The investment is projected to retain roughly 2,000 existing jobs and create 428 new manufacturing positions. The construction process will also create 250 construction jobs in a federally designated disadvantaged community.

The number of electric school buses on the road has skyrocketed from 415 to more than 5,100 since 2020. That’s 265,000 students riding electric school buses to and from school each day. Blue Bird has already delivered its 2,000th electric school bus, with models operating in 41 states and multiple Canadian provinces.

The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) and the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) have shaped this surge in Southeast electric school bus manufacturing. The Clean School Bus Program, a BIL-funded initiative, authorizes $5 billion over five years for the EPA to replace diesel buses with low- and zero-emission models. As of July 2025, the Clean School Bus Program has funded 8,500+ electric school buses in over 1,200 school districts, benefiting about 30,000 students in the Southeast.

IRA has provided manufacturing tax credits, supply chain incentives, and clean energy investment support to EV manufacturers. The $80 million Blue Bird expansion is one direct example of IRA dollars at work on both ends of the chain.

In High Point, Thomas Built Buses expanded its workforce in 2022 by adding a second shift, creating 280 new jobs to ramp up production of both diesel and electric models, including its flagship electric bus, the Saf-T-Liner C2 Jouley. The Jouley offers up to 138 miles of range — enough for a full day’s worth of typical school bus routes.

As manufacturers scale up their production, authorized dealers can be an important liaison between the manufacturer and the end user, educating them on the benefits of new technology. Roy Parks, Western Regional Sales Manager for Carolina Thomas, the authorized dealer for Thomas Built in North Carolina, said his team plays a hands-on role in helping districts adopt electric school buses. The relationships between Carolina Thomas and the school districts are built on trust and collective investment.

“We’re kind of the boots on the ground. We’re the ones that deal with them day in and day out… We support them. We sell them the buses. We do training for their service techs,” Parks said.

In mountain communities like Transylvania County in western North Carolina, Thomas Built’s electric school buses are redefining what’s possible in rural Appalachia. When Transylvania County decided to use its Volkswagen settlement funds to purchase electric school buses, Carolina Thomas was eager to test out the buses in a rural, mountainous setting with longer school bus routes.

“We felt like Transylvania, with its hills, the length of its routes, the climate… would be a good testing ground to see how it performed in that particular application,” Parks said.

For Carolina Thomas, it’s about truly understanding the needs of each district. Early deployments in Transylvania County taught valuable lessons about matching bus specs, chargers, and route profiles.

“We kind of have a saying at Carolina Thomas — it’s from conception to completion.”

– Roy Parks, Western Regional Sales Manager, Carolina Thomas

Benefits and Operational Shifts

According to Parks, districts are seeing both environmental and operational gains. Electric school buses don’t have a tailpipe, which means they don’t emit particulate matter and nitrous oxide. These pollutants can contribute to respiratory disease, heart disease, cancer, and other health problems. Lowered school bus emissions have even been shown to correlate with improved school performance.

“It’s a lot cleaner, you’re reducing the carbon footprint, it’s zero emissions,” Parks said. “The one thing that a lot of drivers say once they get in it is it’s just such a consistent, smooth ride.”

Electric school buses also have the potential to function as resiliency hubs during emergencies, providing air conditioning, electricity, and even Wi-Fi to communities after severe weather events.

He noted that maintenance savings, such as no oil changes and fewer filters, can be substantial, with some reports suggesting 50% to two-thirds lower daily operating costs for EVs, depending on geography and weather.

“It’s more cost-effective to operate it day-to-day, compared to a diesel bus, and that’s cost savings for the state as well as the local districts,” Parks said.

Federal incentives through the EPA’s Clean School Bus Program have helped districts nationwide order more of these buses.

The Impact of Federal Funding & Risk of Losing it

Despite clear wins in clean school bus manufacturing, recent months have brought turbulence. In mid-2025, the EPA froze roughly $1 billion in reimbursements for 3,400 electric school buses due to political and administrative disputes. Nearly 500 school districts faced delays or funding gaps, forcing some to postpone purchases or rely more heavily on state-level programs. The current administration also failed to release the most recent annual allocation of Clean School Bus funds, an announcement that was anticipated at the beginning of 2025.

“The public funding has just been critical. It’s been the reason that this has gotten off the ground,” Parks said.

Without a stable federal funding pipeline, the push for electric school buses could stall, especially in less affluent districts that can’t front the costs.

What Happens Next?

Blue Bird aims to bring its new EV facility entirely online, creating more than 400 new jobs and boosting production capacity well beyond its current levels.

Thomas Built continues to refine its electric lineup, with new-generation models like the 2025 Jouley and potential future long-range options.

Policymakers and industry leaders face a choice: secure and expand funding to meet climate and public health goals, or let our nation’s children continue to breathe in toxic tailpipe emissions on their ride to school.

Federal investment from BIL and IRA has turned the Southeast into a surprising hub for electric school bus production, creating hundreds of new jobs and accelerating the shift to zero-emission transportation. But sustaining that progress will require steady policy support, continued investment in manufacturing and charging infrastructure, and a commitment to ensuring these benefits reach every community, not just those that can afford to wait out funding freezes.",https://cleanenergy.org/wp-content/uploads/THOMASWORKERS03-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-08-25 11:06:20.024621

The Bucks County Commissioners on Wednesday approved $67,193 for equipment that will allow the county’s consumer protection weights and measures team to test EV charging stations.

“We all know a lot of folks out there now are driving EVs. However, nobody is inspecting the stations for safety, for accuracy, that you get what you’re paying for,” said Mike Bannon, who heads the Bucks County Consumer Protection and Weights and Measures Department. “We inspect gas stations to make sure when you buy a gallon of gas, you actually get a gallon of gas. Now we’re going to start checking to make sure when you buy a kilowatt of energy, you’re getting a kilowatt of energy.”

While every gas pump in Bucks County undergoes annual inspection to verify accuracy, no similar oversight exists for EV charging stations.

The county’s existing weights and measures team will conduct the new inspections.

“We’ve got a great team, trained people that go out and inspect gas stations on a regular basis. Now, they’ll be doing EV stations and it’s exactly the same thing,” Bannon said.

He noted his team has the authority to shut down chargers if problems or safety issues are found.

“Good job … it’s a good idea,” said Commissioner Gene DiGirolamo, a Republican.

The equipment will be purchased from Tesco, a Bristol Township-based company that provides similar equipment nationwide.

County officials noted the benefit of supporting a local business.

“The really cool part about it is the company that’s providing the equipment is a Bristol Township business that provides for the whole United States,” Bannon said. “We’re very excited to do business with them.”

The new inspection program comes as Bucks County prepares to install its own EV charging infrastructure.

The county is receiving funding through the Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission to install 16 chargers on county property, including in county parks.

“We want to make sure our chargers are working properly,” said Commissioner Bob Harvie, a Democrat. “If you’re coming to Core Creek Park and you want to plug in to an EV charger, we want to make sure that you’re getting the charge you think you’re paying for.”

Harvie noted the project has been in development for several years.

According to PennDOT data from last year, there are more than 63,000 electric vehicles in the state and 274,800 hybrid vehicles, which use electric and gas motors.

The inspection program will begin once the equipment is delivered and staff complete any necessary training.

“It’s a new field, and we’re very excited to be part of it and to kind of go out and roll out this program,” Bannon said.

Let’s work together to continue supporting rural Missouri’s Constitutional right to farm by supporting energy development.
Because I am not only a clean energy advocate, but someone whose family still farms their land in Webster County.","This month marks over two hundred years since Missouri’s first Constitution was ratified. Back then, agriculture, mining, and trade were the cornerstones of our territorial economy. While much has changed, one thing remains constant: Missouri’s land and natural resources continue to shape our economic future—driving growth, creating jobs, and laying the foundation for prosperity.

Missouri takes pride in its agricultural legacy and deep commitment to Constitutional freedoms. For generations, Missourians have cultivated the land with the belief that individual rights, including the right to manage and use one’s own property, are essential to rural prosperity and personal liberty. The right to farm, choose what to grow, and make decisions that benefit your family and land is at the heart of our state’s identity and was the basis for our 2014 Right to Farm Constitutional Amendment. These values of independence, hard work, and local control shape the way we live and the policies we support.

That very amendment includes a right to produce energy on your acreage. Energy development in Missouri goes hand in hand with Missouri’s tradition of protecting private property rights. The freedom to decide what you farm on your land, whether beef, soybeans, or megawatts, supports rural Missourians’ desire for self-reliance and self-determination.

Developing Missouri-made energy is an economic win for both farmers and localities. Land leases for solar create long-term income for generational farms, protecting them from droughts, a volatile traditional crop market, and other economic factors that may force their hand in selling their farms. Annually, renewable energy projects provide about $22.1 million in land lease payments to Missouri producers and landowners. This translates into real wins. Solar keeps tractors running, funnels dollars into local businesses, and allows young families to stay rooted in communities. These voluntary projects are crucial to expanding opportunities for farm families while protecting their way of life.

These benefits aren’t hypothetical. It’s happening all over our state. My team at Renew Missouri recently highlighted the story of a fourth-generation farmer named Bill in Cooper County. After decades growing wheat, soybeans, and corn, Bill leased part of his land for solar, diversifying his income through reliable, consistent land-lease payments. The panels will be designed to blend with surrounding fields, maintaining both aesthetics and agricultural identity. As a result, Bill is renewing the economic stability of his farm and continuing traditional planting on the majority of his land while proudly contributing to Missouri’s energy security.

“Our ability to use the property more efficiently has improved, and that means we can devote some land to meeting energy needs,” he said. “As times change, we still look at how economic opportunities have changed. I am open to how we use the property… I think this is the best thing to do.”

By protecting a landowner’s right to farm, we are allowing farmers the opportunity to harvest a crop that preserves the land’s rural character while simultaneously providing critical homegrown power resources for Missourians across the state.

Let’s work together to continue supporting rural Missouri’s Constitutional right to farm by supporting energy development. Because I am not only a clean energy advocate, but someone whose family still farms their land in Webster County. My family, as well as all others, deserve the right to do with their land as they see fit.",https://themissouritimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/OpEdWeb2.jpg,N,,2025-08-25 12:11:41.395387

The combination of policy volatility and demand uncertainty has made long-term capital investments in battery manufacturing increasingly risky propositions.","The Battery Retreat: When European Dreams Collide with Global Realities

REUTLINGEN, Germany — Porsche AG announced that it will abandon in-house battery cell production and convert its Cellforce subsidiary from a manufacturing operation into a research and development center, affecting approximately 200 of the unit's nearly 300 employees. The German luxury automaker cited ""reasons of volume and lack of economies of scale"" for ending its pursuit of independent battery cell production, according to company statements. Porsche framed the decision as a ""realignment of battery activities"" driven by slower-than-expected growth in electric vehicle demand and deteriorating market conditions in China and the United States. Cellforce, originally established to produce high-performance battery cells for Porsche's electric sports cars, will scrap its expansion plans for manufacturing and instead focus exclusively on cell and system development. The affected employees will face job cuts handled ""in a socially responsible manner,"" with potential placement opportunities available at Volkswagen Group's battery arm, PowerCo.

The strategic retreat represents a significant reversal for Porsche's vertical integration ambitions and underscores broader challenges facing European automakers attempting to build independent battery supply chains. Despite the manufacturing pivot, Porsche emphasized that electrification remains central to its product roadmap, citing a 57% electrification rate in Europe during the first half of 2025. This decision illuminates the harsh economic realities confronting European battery manufacturing, where ambitious technological visions increasingly collide with the unforgiving mathematics of global scale economics.

When Scale Becomes the Only Truth That Matters

The Arithmetic of Abandonment

Economies of scale in battery manufacturing is the principle where increasing production volume significantly lowers the per-unit cost of each battery. This cost advantage is the primary reason for building massive ""gigafactories,"" as their large-scale, automated production lines are designed to drive down manufacturing costs and make electric vehicles more affordable.

Inside Cellforce's modern facilities, advanced machinery stands ready to produce high-performance battery cells that will now never roll off production lines. The company's internal analysis, shared with employees during tense all-hands meetings, revealed what industry veterans had quietly suspected: scaling to a ""viable cost position"" proved impossible given global volume constraints and deteriorating market conditions in China and the United States.

The mathematics are unforgiving. Without achieving the 40-60 gigawatt-hour annual production thresholds that define competitive battery manufacturing, even premium automakers cannot compete with Asian giants who produce at massive scale. Porsche discovered what other European manufacturers have learned through painful experience—that technological sophistication cannot overcome the fundamental economics of volume manufacturing.

Did you know: As gigafactories scale from tens to hundreds of GWh, lithium‑ion battery cell costs follow a steep learning curve—each doubling of cumulative production typically cuts per‑kWh cost by about 20–30%, a pattern consistent with Wright’s Law and reinforced recently by rapid EV-driven volume growth, factory automation, and supply-chain maturation; recent industry trackers show pack prices falling from around $139/kWh in 2023 toward roughly $115/kWh in 2024, implying ongoing cell-level declines as scale, high line utilization, and chemistry shifts like LFP continue to push costs down toward materials-driven floors.

""The scale economics bite harder than anyone wants to admit,"" confided a Brussels-based industry consultant familiar with multiple European battery projects. ""Premium positioning and advanced technology cannot overcome scale disadvantages when you're ultimately producing a commodity.""

The human cost of this strategic recalibration extends beyond individual career disruptions. The nearly 200 employees facing elimination represent accumulated expertise in battery chemistry, manufacturing engineering, and systems integration—knowledge that took years to develop and will be difficult to recreate. Many joined Cellforce specifically because they believed in building European technological sovereignty.

""We came here to be part of something transformational,"" said one former Cellforce engineer who spoke on condition of anonymity. ""Instead, we're watching the dream get downsized into a PowerPoint presentation about 'strategic realignment.'""

Porsche has promised ""socially responsible"" transitions, including potential redeployment within Volkswagen Group's PowerCo unit. Yet for workers who invested their careers in the promise of European battery independence, these assurances feel insufficient compensation for the collapse of a shared vision.

Europe's Battery Dreams Meet Global Reality

Porsche's retreat echoes across a continent where ambitious visions of technological sovereignty increasingly confront the unforgiving economics of global competition. The pattern has become depressingly familiar: European manufacturers announce bold battery manufacturing plans, governments provide substantial subsidies, and then reality intrudes with devastating clarity.

Stellantis paused gigafactory plans in Germany and Italy. Ford downsized its Michigan facility from 35 to 20 gigawatt-hours. Most dramatically, Northvolt—once heralded as Europe's battery champion—collapsed into bankruptcy, leaving a trail of stranded assets and shattered expectations.

""The European battery strategy assumed that premium positioning and advanced technology could overcome scale disadvantages,"" noted a senior consultant who has advised multiple failed European battery ventures. ""What we've learned is that in commodity manufacturing—which battery production ultimately becomes—scale and cost efficiency matter more than technological sophistication or political ambition.""

The numbers tell the story with brutal precision. European battery projects need to achieve 40-60 gigawatt-hours annually to reach competitive cost positions. Without that scale, even premium brands cannot justify the enormous capital investments required. Asian manufacturers, operating at massive scale with established supply chains, continue gaining market share through aggressive pricing that European startups cannot match.

This industrial reality has forced European policymakers to confront uncomfortable truths about the limits of subsidy-driven industrial policy in creating globally competitive manufacturing ecosystems.

Strategic Pivot Toward Innovation

Rather than complete abandonment, Porsche's move represents a strategic pivot toward what industry observers describe as a more sustainable approach to battery technology development. By converting Cellforce into an independent R&D unit, the company preserves valuable engineering expertise while avoiding the capital-intensive path of manufacturing scale-up.

This approach allows Porsche to continue developing specialized battery technologies for high-performance applications—where the company's premium positioning could justify higher costs—while leveraging partnerships for volume production. The expertise developed at Cellforce could support broader Volkswagen Group initiatives through integration with PowerCo and other battery-related ventures.

Industry analysts suggest this model—maintaining technological leadership through research while partnering for manufacturing—may become the template for other premium automakers facing similar scale economics challenges. The approach preserves innovation capability while reducing capital risk in an increasingly competitive and volatile market.

Market Dynamics Driving Change

The timing of Porsche's decision reflects broader shifts in global EV market dynamics that have complicated the business case for independent battery manufacturing. Slower-than-expected EV adoption rates, particularly in luxury segments, have reduced volume projections that once justified massive manufacturing investments.

Simultaneously, trade tensions and tariff uncertainties have created additional complexity for companies attempting to build regional supply chains. The combination of policy volatility and demand uncertainty has made long-term capital investments in battery manufacturing increasingly risky propositions.

Chinese battery manufacturers have continued gaining market share through aggressive pricing and improved technology, making it increasingly difficult for new entrants to establish competitive positions without substantial scale advantages.

These market dynamics have forced automotive companies to reassess whether vertical integration in battery manufacturing represents strategic advantage or unnecessary risk concentration.

Investment Implications and Forward Outlook

For investment professionals analyzing the automotive transition, Porsche's decision signals several important trends that could reshape capital allocation across the sector. The move suggests that specialized technology development may offer better risk-adjusted returns than manufacturing scale-up for premium automotive brands.

Companies maintaining focus on R&D and strategic partnerships while avoiding heavy manufacturing investments may demonstrate more resilient business models during periods of market volatility. This approach allows for greater strategic flexibility as battery technologies continue evolving and market conditions remain uncertain.

The consolidation trend in European battery manufacturing could create opportunities for established Asian manufacturers to expand their market positions through acquisition or partnership arrangements. Investors may find value in companies positioned to benefit from this consolidation rather than those attempting independent scale-up.

Energy storage applications may offer alternative growth paths for battery technology companies as demand patterns in that sector prove more predictable than automotive applications. The expertise developed for automotive batteries often translates effectively to stationary storage systems with different scale economics.

The Road Ahead

Porsche's strategic retreat from battery manufacturing while maintaining R&D capabilities suggests a maturing industry recognition that technological leadership and manufacturing scale represent different strategic challenges requiring different approaches.

The company maintains that electrification remains central to its product strategy, citing a 57% electrification rate in Europe during the first half of 2025. However, the path toward electrification increasingly involves partnerships and specialization rather than vertical integration across the entire value chain.

For European policymakers, Porsche's decision represents both challenge and opportunity. While it demonstrates the limitations of subsidy-driven industrial policy in creating globally competitive manufacturing, it also highlights the potential for maintaining technological leadership through focused R&D investment.

The broader automotive industry appears to be settling into a more realistic assessment of the battery value chain, where technological innovation and manufacturing scale are increasingly recognized as distinct capabilities requiring different strategic approaches and capital allocation decisions.

AspectSummaryCore EventPorsche pivots from in-house battery cell manufacturing (Cellforce) to an R&D-focused model, signaling a broader industry shift.Industry TrendA 2024-25 ""right-sizing"" of EV/battery capital expenditure (capex) across automakers (OEMs) and cell manufacturers.Root Causes1. Softer Demand: Growth rate has decelerated from 2021-22 projections.

2. Policy Shock: U.S. tax credit expiration (Sept 2025) and tariff volatility create uncertainty.

3. Scale Economics: EU-made cells are uncompetitive below 40-60 GWh/site.

4. Tech Timing Risk: Next-gen batteries (e.g., Li-S, high-Si) are not yet ready for giga-scale.Key Examples• VW/PowerCo: 240 GWh by 2030 goal abandoned; capex now milestone-gated.

• Stellantis/ACC: Paused plants to re-work cost targets.

• Ford: Downsized Michigan plant from 35 to 20 GWh.

• Panasonic/LGES/Samsung SDI: Trimming capex, guiding for sluggish demand.

• Northvolt: Collapsed; assets now a salvage operation.Strategic Implications1. Europe Consolidates: Shift from volume hubs to ""capability hubs"" (R&D, pilot lines) and strategic import blending.

2. Profit Pool Migration: Temporary shift to hybrids, ESS (Energy Storage Systems), and premium niches.

3. Scale Wins: Large incumbents (Asian cell makers) get stronger; sub-scale EU players are risky.

4. Policy Volatility = Alpha: Trading opportunities around credit expirations and tariff headlines.Tactical Advice (OEMs)• Kill sub-scale manufacturing dreams.

The Revolution Wind project was originally one of the bright spots in an earnings call by Ørsted on Aug. 11.","PROVIDENCE — The Trump administration decided to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory on Friday, announcing it was ordering a halt to construction of the Revolution Wind offshore wind farm with just a year left before completion of the multi-year project.

Acting director of the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM), Matthew Giacona, demanded Ørsted cease construction on the project Friday, saying the federal Department of the Interior needed time to address concerns that have arisen since Trump was inaugurated in January.

(BOEM originally approved the 13,700-acre lease of the Revolution Wind area in early 2020 during the first Trump administration).

“In particular,” wrote Giacona, “BOEM is seeking to address concerns related to the protection of national security interests of the United States and prevention of interference with reasonable uses of the exclusive economic zone, the high seas, and the territorial seas…”

Rhode Island officials decried Trump’s order as undermining state efforts to expand its energy supply and provide jobs for the local economy. In a statement issued over the weekend, Gov. Dan McKee said the stop-work order would endanger hundreds of local union jobs, and a valuable supply of renewable electricity for 350,000 homes.

“At a time when we should be moving forward with solutions for energy, jobs, and affordability, the Trump administration is choosing delay and disruption,” said McKee. “We are working with our partners in Connecticut to pursue every avenue to reverse this decision. Revolution Wind is key to Rhode Island’s economic development, energy security, and long-term affordability for our residents.”

Attorney General Peter Neronha characterized the stop-work order from Trump as “bizarre,” and noted that with half the state’s renewable energy portfolio expected to come from Revolution Wind, achieving state climate goals may be impossible.

“The Revolution Wind project is absolutely essential to meeting Rhode Island’s clean energy goals,” said Neronha. “Nearly half of the state’s clean energy portfolio, 400MW to be precise, is slated to come from Revolution Wind upon the project’s completion next year. Without Revolution Wind, our Act on Climate is dead in the water.”

Environmental groups, long bullish on the offshore wind project, also took Trump to task.

“It’s un-American,” said Christian Roselund, campaign lead for Yes to Wind. “It risks putting hard-working men and women out of a job and sabotaging our ability to contain sky-high energy costs. Rhode Islanders want this project to succeed because it means good-paying jobs, lower energy bills, and a cleaner, more resilient future.”

Revolution Wind, along with nearby Sunrise Wind and SouthCoast Wind, were seen as likely safe targets from the Trump administration’s efforts to undermine offshore wind projects. All three offshore wind farms had final major federal permits already in hand by the time Trump was sworn into office.

Even without a hostile administration in Washington, the East Coast’s wind projects had a rocky few years. Inflation and supply chain interruptions from the pandemic meant build times and material costs skyrocketed since 2020, with projects like SouthCoast Wind opting to pay a financial penalty, cancel power purchase agreements and re-bid in the future.

The “Big Beautiful Tax Bill” passed by the Republican Congress makes the math that much worse. Tucked inside one of the legislation’s provisions was an expiration date on the federal tax credits that make the financials for offshore wind work. Developers have until the end of 2027 to get their offshore wind farms online or risk losing out on those federal tax credits. Revolution Wind was likely to meet that deadline, but other projects off New England’s shore were unlikely to become operational by 2027.

The stop-work order is also a big blow to the Ocean State’s environment. Electricity consumption in Rhode Island accounts for 18.6% of all greenhouse gas emissions produced in the state. Cleaning up where residents and businesses source their electricity from is a key plank in curbing building emissions too, which combined account for around a third of all emissions statewide.

Rhode Island has also less than five years left on the clock to meet the next benchmark goal of the Act on Climate. The bill, which became law in 2021, mandates the state reduce its emissions by 45% below 1990 levels by the end of this decade.

The Revolution Wind project was originally one of the bright spots in an earnings call by Ørsted on Aug. 11. Executives of the Danish energy multinational announced they needed another $9.4 billion to finish the nearby Sunrise Wind project, after plans to sell its stake in the offshore farm fell through. Revolution Wind, meanwhile, which started construction in 2023, was approaching its final runway with around 45 of its turbines and all of the foundations for the turbines installed.

“We have continued making good progress and remain on track for commissioning in the second half of 2026,” said Ørsted CEO, Rasmus Errboe, on the Aug. 11 call. “We have made progress on the construction of the onshore substation, as well as the installation of monopoles and turbines.”

The company at the time estimated the 704-megawatt project was about 80% complete, and less than a year away from becoming operational, and becoming eligible for federal tax credits now set to expire by the end of 2027.",http://ecori.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/1_BIWF.jpg,N,,2025-08-25 12:11:47.947345

By Joshua Burd

New Jersey’s pioneering community solar program is poised for a massive expansion under a bill signed into law Friday by Gov. Phil Murphy.

The measure, S4530/A5768, authorizes another 3,000 megawatts of capacity under a framework that has brought rooftop solar panels to warehouses across New Jersey while bringing clean energy to thousands of New Jersey households. That would roughly quadruple the capacity that has been built or earmarked to date by the state Board of Public Utilities since it effectively launched the program in late 2023, bringing solar energy to another 450,000 New Jersey residents, including 250,000 low-income families.

Murphy signed the bill alongside another measure, A5267/S4289, which calls for using incentives to vastly accelerate the construction of energy storage facilities across the state.

“Today, we are taking immediate and far-reaching steps to lower energy costs for every household in New Jersey,” Murphy said. “By accelerating the process for bringing new sources of energy online and rapidly building new energy storage facilities, we will meet growing demand while also making life more affordable for our state’s families. As part of this process, we are going to create good-paying, union jobs and build a cleaner, more resilient future for every New Jerseyan.”

According to the governor’s office, S4530 directs the BPU to open registration by Oct. 1, 2025, for the additional 3,000 megawatts of community solar projects. That’s likely to spark participation by warehouse owners throughout New Jersey that, under the existing program, can lease their rooftops to solar developers.

Solar companies then sell that energy directly to the grid, rather than those inside the building, with at least 51 percent of the power going to low- and moderate-income residents. That’s paved the way for solar capacity in the state to increase from 2.4 to 5.2 gigawatts since Murphy took office in 2018, officials said, with solar currently powering the equivalent of more than 600,000 homes.

“I want to thank Governor Murphy for his leadership in advancing clean power solutions for New Jersey,” BPU President Christine Guhl-Sadovy said. “This legislation addresses real problems. More New Jerseyans will get access to the benefits of expanded community solar programs — one of the best ways for residents to lower their utility bills while contributing to clean energy in the Garden State. And large-scale battery storage will strengthen our electric grid and keep the lights on when we need it most. This is how we build a grid that works for everyone.”

Murphy signed the bills last week during a ceremony at the IBEW Local 269 office in Lawrenceville, standing alongside legislative sponsors, local leaders, union members and advocates. He did so as officials reiterated their criticism of regional grid operator PJM, alleging mismanagement in connection with the energy cost crisis.

The prime sponsors of S4530/A5768 are Sens. Vin Gopal and John McKeon and Luanne Peterpaul, Marge Donlon and Robert Karabinchak of the state Assembly. The prime sponsors of A5267/S4289 are Sens. Bob Smith and John Burzichelli and Assemblymen Wayne DeAngelo, Dave Bailey Jr. and Kevin Egan.

“Community solar has delivered real benefits for working families across New Jersey, but our current limits on project development are holding back its full potential,” Gopal said. “This bill modernizes the program to meet today’s needs, cutting red tape, creating savings and accelerating our clean energy transition. At a time of rising electricity costs, we should be making it easier, not harder, to build local solar projects that lower bills and reduce strain on our grid. This is an opportunity to deliver immediate value to consumers while helping New Jersey meet its clean energy goals. With smart policy and strong investment, community solar can help power our future, affordably and equitably.”

Smith, chair of the Senate Energy Committee, added: “As projected energy demand and electricity costs rise, it is more important than ever to invest in innovative technology that will both enhance the stability of our grid and enable cost savings for New Jersey residents. By incentivizing and procuring the creation of transmission-scale energy storage we will enable a wider application of clean energy that can charge and store energy at low-cost hours then discharge at high-cost, high-demand hours, thus lowering overall costs and smoothing demand spikes on the grid. This legislation will help keep New Jersey at the forefront of investments in new, clean energy technology, even as the current federal administration seeks to sabotage our environment and our renewable future.”",https://re-nj.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/cropped-Screen-Shot-2021-06-28-at-8.45.51-AM-32x32.png,N,,2025-08-25 14:03:37.265133

Those components are made at GM’s plant in Lockport, NY, which was recently retooled to support EV drive manufacturing.
“But, there’s more to do.” Continental Takes the Temperature As EV motors and drives evolve, Tier One suppliers are investing in technology to improve performance and reduce costs.
Manufacturing locations for electric motors and drives are determined based on market demand and regional requirements.
According to Ahmad, three pillars support the evolution of EV traction motors and drives: cost, volume flexibility and strategic localization.","Most e-motors use a permanent magnet (PM) synchronous motor. However, other configurations, such as asynchronous induction motors and electrically excited synchronous machines, are also used, depending on performance, cost and design goals.

These motors are tightly integrated with electronic control systems that regulate power flow, motor speed and torque based on real-time vehicle demands. Increasingly, automakers and suppliers are combining these functions—motor, power electronics and gearbox—into compact e-axle units that simplify assembly and reduce cost and weight.

According to a recent study conducted by IDTechEx, 85 percent of electric vehicles currently use PM motors, 12 percent use induction motors and 3 percent use externally excited synchronous motors.

Traditional traction motors remain the dominant technology in battery-electric vehicles, because of their high-power density and efficiency across a wide range of applications. But, alternatives like wound rotor synchronous motors (WRSM) and induction motors are gaining importance as OEMs look for greater flexibility, supply chain resilience and sustainability.

“Permanent magnet motors offer some of the best cycle efficiency ratings according to the WLTP [Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure] and have powered the bulk of EV fleets from top-tier manufacturers,” says James Edmondson, vice president of research at IDTechEx. “Their high power density enables compact packaging and lower overall weight—critical advantages when trying to extend vehicle range without increasing battery size or cost.”

However, this efficiency comes at a price: reliance on rare-earth materials like neodymium and dysprosium, which are primarily sourced from China. This has triggered concerns about supply chain stability and long-term pricing volatility.

“Improving a motor’s efficiency could reduce the battery capacity needed within a vehicle, saving money on battery costs,” explains Edmondson.

While PM motors tend to be more efficient across the WLTP test cycle, WRSMs can outperform them at higher speeds, making them attractive for specific drive cycles and long-haul applications.

BMW and Renault are among the OEMs exploring WRSM adoption in next-generation platforms, seeking to cut back on rare-earth dependency without a significant performance tradeoff.

According to Edmondson, induction motors are another magnet-free option that offer advantages in terms of cost and simplicity. “While they lack the high continuous power output of PM motors, they’re effective for short bursts of acceleration and serve as auxiliary units in dual-motor EV configurations,” he points out.

When not in use, induction motors contribute no rolling drag, making them a practical choice for secondary drive systems.

Still, material sourcing remains the key concern driving innovation. As the United States and other nations push domestic EV manufacturing agendas, the need for locally available, sustainable alternatives to rare earths is growing.

Companies such as Proterial (using ferrite magnets), Niron Magnetics (developing iron nitride technology) and Passenger (working with strontium ferrite and manganese aluminum carbon alloys) are investing in alternative materials that could reduce the industry’s dependence on China-dominated supply chains.

Despite these efforts, rare earth-based magnets continue to outperform alternatives in terms of efficiency and power density.

“PM motors still offer the best tradeoff of size, weight and energy consumption for most high-volume applications,” claims Edmondson.

Automakers and suppliers continue to face a growing engineering dilemma: how to deliver top-tier motor performance while mitigating cost and supply risks tied to rare-earth materials.

As regulators pressure OEMs to improve sustainability across vehicle life cycles, the gap between magnet-based and magnet-free motors may narrow. Ultimately, there is no one-size-fits-all answer for EV traction motor design. Selection depends on factors such as speed profiles and geographic considerations.

Nevertheless, several American and German manufacturers are tackling the challenge.

A General Approach to Motors

General Motor’s motor and drive strategy hinges on a deeply integrated combination of modular design, digital development and in-house manufacturing.

The use of advanced simulation tools, scalable platforms and purpose-built assembly processes enables GM to adapt across its vehicle lineup. That’s why it’s focusing on developing a modular, scalable drive unit architecture that underpins the company’s Ultium EV platform.

At the heart of this strategy are traction motors and integrated drive units. These assemblies—critical to propulsion performance—are designed with flexibility, manufacturability and integration in mind.

“We have a modular architecture,” says Norman Peralta, GM executive chief engineer for global electric propulsion systems. “We have developed three different motors, and they are used in multiple applications across our whole EV portfolio.”

This approach allows GM engineers to use the same hardware across different types of vehicle platforms. For instance, a front-wheel-drive crossover, a rear-wheel-drive performance car and an all-wheel-drive pickup truck might share motor designs or configurations.

“The hardware’s the same, but the software might be different,” explains Peralta. “You can create a lot of different combinations with this modularity.”

Each drive unit integrates an electric motor, power electronics and gearbox into a compact assembly that is built in-house. GM produces front and rear units with differing capabilities and dimensions depending on the application.

“We design everything together—the gearbox, the electric motor and the inverter,” says Kris Keary, chief engineer for car and crossover SUV drive units and power electronics at General Motors. “We look at everything from efficiency, performance, manufacturability, serviceability and mass—and we’re doing that as a system.”

Virtual tools enable GM engineers to build digital twins of the motor and drive units, simulate how they fit and function in a vehicle, and optimize the design for manufacturing before a single part is produced.

“We use tools to simulate torque ripple, vibration and noise,” explains Keary. “We use electromagnetic simulation tools to design the motors and multi-body dynamics to simulate the drive units.

“We have a vertically integrated strategy,” says Keary. “We wind our own motors, and we build our own stators and rotors.”

Ultium motors feature a bar-wound stator construction, which enables high slot fill and excellent thermal performance. The bar winding—also referred to as hairpin winding—is shaped and inserted with high precision. Those components are made at GM’s plant in Lockport, NY, which was recently retooled to support EV drive manufacturing.

Once the motor and inverter are produced, they are mated in final drive unit assembly, a process GM has worked to standardize.

“We’re trying to make things that are scalable and repeatable,” notes Keary. “That includes how we assemble them, how we test them and how we validate them.

Throughout this process, engineers rely on early and continuous feedback from their virtual tools.”

“Before we even build a part, we’re modeling the structural integrity of our drive units,” adds Peralta. “We’re looking at bearing life, gear mesh, lubrication and temperature effects. That allows us to get the architecture right before we even start cutting metal.”

According to Keary, final assembly operations are designed for both flexibility and automation. “We’re really using a modular system of assemblies,” he points out. “If we need to swap in a different gear ratio or motor configuration for a different application; we can do that with minimal rework.”

Thermal management is another area where virtual development and assembly planning intersect. Because the drive unit integrates motor and power electronics, GM engineers had to find ways to efficiently cool both components within a single housing.

“We’re doing thermal analysis across the whole system,” says Keary. “That includes coolant flow through the motor, the inverter and the gearbox.”

The inverter itself is a critical piece of the puzzle. GM develops its own power electronics hardware, integrating it tightly with the motor.

“That tight integration of motor and inverter gives us really good control over performance and thermal behavior,” claims Peralta.

The inverter, built with silicon carbide or silicon depending on the application, is validated alongside the motor and gearbox as a complete system. GM assembles these inverters internally and then mounts them directly to the drive unit.

“We do full end-of-line testing,” says Keary. “We run them with load, measuring torque, current and voltage. That gives us complete confidence before it goes into a vehicle.”

GM’s investment in flexible tooling and automation ensures that each component—from stator winding to final drive unit assembly—can meet volume and quality targets.

“We use automated systems for hairpin insertion, welding and quality checks,” explains Keary. “We’ve worked closely with our manufacturing engineering teams to make sure everything is repeatable and scalable.”

At the vehicle level, the modular nature of Ultium drive units allows engineers to pair components across multiple platforms. A single platform can support both front-wheel drive and all-wheel drive variants simply by adding or removing drive units.

“You can take the same motor and inverter and just change the software,” says Peralta. “That gives us tremendous scale.”

This modular, vertically integrated approach has enabled GM to control its supply chain and manufacturing processes, in addition to accelerating the rate at which new vehicles can be brought to market.

“Because we do everything together—from the motor to the gearbox to the inverter—we’re able to validate and manufacture much faster,” claims Keary.

Orbis Electric Wheels Around

Orbis Electric is a start-up company in California that has developed in-wheel axial flux motors that use electric and hybrid power train technology to deliver a slimmer and lighter device. It has several customers that are currently testing the technology in passenger and commercial vehicles.

HaloDrive is designed around a modular four-part architecture with breakthrough innovations like an injection-molded plastic stator and a tunable gearset. This system delivers strong levels of performance, efficiency and configurability, while maintaining high torque and power density with greater thermal stability. It’s designed to reduce vehicle weight and improve range by 20 percent.

“Our vision with HaloDrive is to significantly advance how businesses transition to electrification by removing electric motor barriers such as deployment costs, material and manufacturability risks, and performance limitations,” says Chance Claxton, CEO of Orbis Electric. “With HaloDrive, we offer a high-performance axial flux motor that is not only highly efficient and powerful, but also environmentally sustainable.”

“Our approach with HaloDrive is about creating a motor that not only meets the immediate electrification needs across a range of industries, but is also compact and efficient enough to position businesses for future energy and sustainability standards,” adds Marcus Hays, chief technology officer at Orbis Electric. “We can achieve exceptional performance while also mitigating risks tied to rare-earth materials, ensuring consistent availability and pricing stability.

“Axial flux motors offer significantly greater power and torque density per kilo than other types of permanent magnet motors,” explains Hays. “Our company has been advocating for motors positioned within the wheel openings.”

In-wheel motors are visually distinguishable by a pancake-like form factor, which, due to their exceptionally thin profiles, offer numerous mounting locations.

“Despite these performance advantages, the inherently complex electromechanical internal architecture of axial flux motors requires a significant price premium, which until now has limited their broad adoption,” says Hays.

“[We] can deliver in-wheel motors that weigh no more than conventional wheel assemblies that are motor-less,” claims Hays.

“With AI now fully integrated into our computer-operated simulation studies, we are able to analyze thousands and thousands of permutations within a comparatively short period of time,” Hays points out. “This enables us to ensure that every possible decimal point of improvement in material and operational efficiency can be realized prior to production.

“Cooler motors are not only more energy efficient, but demand less of the surrounding equipment, including storage batteries, inverters, radiators and cooling systems,” says Hays.

Seemingly small gains—even a 1 percent improvement in efficiency—compound and lead to significant improvements in range, cost and sustainability. Reducing the volumetric content of metals such as copper and rare-earth magnets is crucial for the company’s long-term goal.

“We use two-thirds less of these materials than our competitors, while delivering two times the power and torque,” notes Hays. “But, there’s more to do.”

Continental Takes the Temperature

As EV motors and drives evolve, Tier One suppliers are investing in technology to improve performance and reduce costs. For instance, engineers at Continental AG recently developed a rotor temperature sensor (eRTS).

The device enables direct temperature measurement on the rotor, giving e-motors more control over key aspects of power train engineering, potentially unlocking material savings and improved performance. It opens new possibilities for optimizing both magnet configuration and motor cooling.

For PM motors, the ability to measure temperature precisely at the rotor enables engineers to significantly narrow the tolerance range they must design for. That tighter band of uncertainty gives them a choice: either improve performance or reduce the amount of dysprosium required in the magnets.

“In one case, OEMs can reduce the dysprosium content thanks to the smaller tolerance range now needed,” says Franck Nieceron, electronic group leader for development e-mobility sensors at Continental. “This leads to material savings in both cost and environmental impact.”

Alternatively, engineers can maintain their current rare-earth usage and stretch the operating temperature range of the motor, thereby enhancing performance under demanding conditions.

The potential impact on motor cooling is also notable. Direct rotor measurement could enable future designs that rely less on aggressive cooling strategies, although it’s still too early to quantify savings in that area.

“It will potentially allow for reduced cooling requirements, but so far there is no evaluation of savings,” explains Nieceron. “For rotor balancing, integrating the eRTS sensor requires drilling a cavity in the rotor for the sensing unit, a process that could impact existing manufacturing workflows.

“In case an imbalance is an issue that must be handled, it is possible to place a corresponding weight symmetrically opposite or to adjust the rotor mass accordingly to achieve overall balance,” says Nieceron.

While full standardization is not yet feasible, due to the varied nature of electric motor architectures, the core concept of the mote-transducer unit placed on the stator is already defined.

“We have successfully tested the concept and the savings,” Nieceron points out. “We are ready to develop the system with car manufacturers. The standardization and integration will follow once serial production comes closer.”

Given the diversity in EV motor designs, including differences in shape, operating speeds and thermal environments, Continental doesn’t expect to deliver a one-size-fits-all solution.

Instead, Nieceron says the goal is to adapt the eRTS architecture with only minor modifications to suit different customer requirements and inverter protocols.

Beyond integration mechanics, the eRTS system also offers strategic implications for sourcing materials.

By reducing the rotor temperature tolerance range from 59°F to 37°F, the sensor enables tighter performance control and allows OEMs to use less dysprosium.

“The reduction of dysprosium will permit us to reduce dependency on rare-earth elements and secure the sourcing of magnets,” says Nieceron. “Even a few grams of savings per magnet could lead to substantial cost reductions, given current market prices and projected demand from accelerating global electromobility trends. The resulting savings significantly exceed the cost of the sensor.”

Looking ahead, Continental also sees opportunities to combine the eRTS with the existing eRPS (Electric Rotor Position Sensor) to streamline EV drive unit design.

By fusing temperature sensing and rotor position tracking into a single product, the company hopes to simplify integration, reduce parts count and shorten assembly time.

According to Nieceron, the dual-function approach supports both cost optimization and vehicle performance enhancements. “This goes in the direction of improving car performance and reducing cost,” he explains. “Combining these two functionalities into one product will help improve costs and reduce the number of components, which in turn simplifies integration.”

Volkswagen Goes Vertical

Volkswagen AG is pursuing a vertically integrated approach to electric drive manufacturing in a bid to optimize performance, cost and supply chain resilience.

Rather than relying entirely on third-party suppliers, the company is producing key components of its electric power trains—including motors, inverters and transmissions—at its global network of factories.

“We want to keep the whole system in our own hands,” says Lars Hentschel, head of electric drives, systems and components at Volkswagen.

Developing electric drive systems in-house allows the automaker to tightly align motor and inverter designs with vehicle-level requirements, such as braking behavior, torque control and power management in relation to battery voltage.

“This is a good way to design a product that is optimized for [our] specific demands,” explains Hentschel. “It also avoids the limitations of optimizing individual components in isolation.

“If you work only with suppliers, you typically define requirements for one specific component and get a local optimum,” adds Alexander Krick, Ph.D., head of technical development for e-drives, inverters and transmissions at Volkswagen Group Components. “What we do instead is optimize all relevant components—battery, inverter and e-motor—together, to reach a global optimum.”

Volkswagen Group Components serves as an internal Tier One supplier within the company, manufacturing power train systems across several global locations. Manufacturing locations for electric motors and drives are determined based on market demand and regional requirements.

According to Krick, a full EV drive system, including motor, inverter and gearbox, can be assembled from approximately 150 components vs. up to 1,500 individual parts for a traditional internal combustion engine (ICE) power train.

“Electric drives are much simpler than ICE power trains, but it is the key component responsible for efficiency,” says Krick, adding that a high degree of automation is essential to achieve stringent quality goals.

Volkswagen uses a highly automated process to mass-produce motors. The most complex element, the stator, begins with a laminated steel core made from 0.2-millimeter thick sheets, which are stamped and prepared with slot insulation to electrically isolate the copper hairpins inserted in the next stages.

The insulated copper hairpins are inserted into the stator slots, shaped and positioned into a configuration referred to internally as a “basket.” That is joined with the stator core, followed by a series of fully automated steps, including widening, twisting and laser welding, to form all electrical connections.

To stabilize and secure the stator windings for a lifetime of operation, the assembly undergoes a “dipping and trickling” process, where a liquid resin is applied and then hardened through controlled heating and cooling.

“This ensures the hairpins are fixed in place,” explains Krick. “Otherwise, movement during operation could lead to insulation issues and electrical failures.”

Rotor assembly follows a parallel path. Magnets are inserted and fixed with similar hardening techniques to withstand high rotational forces, and then magnetized and dynamically balanced.

Once both stator and rotor are complete, they are assembled with the inverter and gearbox into a single drive unit housing, then shipped to VW’s final assembly plants.

“We first integrate the battery, then the power train and gear shafts,” says Hentschel. “The mechanical integration must be exact, but we also ensure all electrical connections and software [systems] are in place. Everything must be running before a car leaves the factory.”

“An ICE always needs intake systems, cooling and exhaust treatment—complex systems that only work together in the car,” notes Hentschel. “An electric drive just needs voltage, which is easy to simulate.”

That simplicity makes e-drives more straightforward to validate independently from the full vehicle, helping streamline development and integration. Volkswagen is also deploying artificial intelligence to support predictive quality on its production lines.

“We have dedicated AI systems on the shop floor that can predict whether a component’s deviation will lead to acoustic or performance issues down the line,” explains Krick.

These models are trained using correlations between individual part measurements and end-of-line test results. They improve continuously with more data.

“We look at virtual models, tolerances, gaps and electrical characteristics from the earliest stages,” says Hentschel. “If we don’t account for key parameters during simulation, we risk problems once the tolerances shift in the factory.”

ZF Focuses on Sustainability

Tier One supplier ZF is leaning into its expertise in e-motor technology and applying new manufacturing strategies to meet growing demand for EV motors. It’s doubling down on localized production, advanced design tools and flexible manufacturing to stay ahead in a competitive and complex market.

“[We have] a long history of e-motor technology development for both hybrid systems and pure EVs,” says Sal Ahmad, head of strategy and product line electronics for e-mobility at ZF North America. “More recently, we’ve made progress in our ‘local for local’ strategic footprint, with production capability that allows us to eliminate most geopolitical issues.

“We have designs that have been adapted to specific markets,” Ahmad points out. “[Our] traction motor range spans from 50 to 400 kilowatts, with applications across automotive, commercial vehicles and micromobility segments. Digital innovation is also reshaping [our] product development process.

“Advanced software tools like digital twins and AI are improving validation and testing,” notes Ahmad. “The primary benefits are reduced development time and requirement evaluation.”

Digital twins enable full 3D simulation of manufacturing processes even before assembly lines are physically built, which in turn supports process optimization and reduces time to market.

ZF’s flex manufacturing strategy was designed to accommodate unpredictable shifts in electrification timelines.

“[It] allows us the flexibility that the current market requires to pivot with evolving market demand,” says Ahmad. “Technology and volume flexibility is a key element, due to the uncertainty around electrification timing.

“We must be able to offer our customers a full range of propulsion solutions, including ICE, HEV, PHEV and BEV technologies for both the passenger vehicle and commercial vehicle segments,” explains Ahmad.

According to Ahmad, three pillars support the evolution of EV traction motors and drives: cost, volume flexibility and strategic localization. Each is essential for scaling production while maintaining competitive pricing in global markets.

One of today’s biggest challenges is reducing dependence on rare-earth materials.

“This supply chain vulnerability threatens the stability and resilience of local manufacturing ecosystems,” warns Ahmad. “In the long run, the industry needs to diversify supply sources for rare-earth materials and develop magnet-free technologies.”

To address this issue, ZF engineers have developed a separately excited synchronous motor (SESM). It transmits energy for the magnetic field via an inductive exciter inside the rotor shaft. This makes the motor compact, with maximum power and torque density.

Compared to traditional SESM systems, the inductive exciter can reduce losses for the energy transmission into the rotor by 15 percent. In addition, the CO2 footprint in production, which arises with PM synchronous e-motors due to magnets that rely on rare-earth materials, can be reduced by up to 50 percent.

Torque density is also significantly increased, because of an innovative rotor design. The space-neutral integration of the exciter into the rotor means that there are no axial space disadvantages. In addition, an increase in power density in the rotor leads to an improvement in performance.

Beyond materials strategy, Ahmad believes that efficiency optimization remains a central objective. “It impacts vehicle range, battery life and overall performance,” he points out, adding that sustainability is no longer optional.

“Sustainability practices have become an essential hygiene factor that the market and regulators demand,” concludes Ahmad.",https://www.assemblymag.com/ext/resources/issues2/2025/09-sep/aem/aem0925motor3-forweb.jpg?height=635&t=1755787062&width=1200,N,,2025-08-25 11:06:49.514633

Virtual power plants (VPPs) hold the potential to reshape the energy system

German VPP developer sonnen enters Canadian market

“As more Californians instal home batteries, programmes like DSGS will be an important opportunity to tap into those batteries to improve energy affordability, enhance system reliability, and advance decarbonisation goals.”

Launched by the California Energy Commission in 2022, DSGS pays customers to discharge stored energy from residential and commercial batteries during periods of high demand or grid stress.

This “distributed power plant” approach helps avoid costly and polluting fossil fuel peaker plants, improves energy affordability, and reduces the risk of rolling blackouts during heatwaves and wildfires.

As part of its research, The Brattle Group reviewed a recent battery dispatch demonstration event in July that delivered over 500MW to the grid – roughly half the peak electricity demand of San Francisco.

The report explains how there was a visible reduction in net load, with the average reduction of 539MW representing roughly 1.9% of CAISO’s net peak demand during the event.

Mary Powell, CEO of Sunrun, said: “Brattle’s report confirms the incredible power of the massive distributed power plant we have built.

“Aggregating home generation and storage produces a reliable, flexible energy resource that dispatches at the same scale as multiple peak generation plants to help meet soaring electricity demand.”

Colby Hastings, senior director of Residential Energy at Tesla Energy, noted that, “This 539MW VPP (virtual power plant) test event demonstrates how distributed assets can reliably support the grid at scale and reduce costs for all.

“With more than 1.8GW of residential battery capacity already installed in California, the untapped potential is significant. Establishing a permanent pathway for these resources is critical, and we look forward to advancing this work with our customers, partners, utilities, regulators, CAISO, and the legislature.”

Looking ahead, the report recommends that the value of the DSGS programme could be maximised by increasing flexibility in event triggers, integrating the programme’s capabilities more fully into state resource planning initiatives, and optimising dispatch patterns to deliver additional grid services.",https://www.smart-energy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/energy-smart-homes.jpg,N,,2025-08-25 10:00:24.475288

RRC Polytech is bringing down costs for Canadians and helping them get ahead by continuing to grow its critical role in Canada’s low-carbon transition, along with its capacity to train the workforce of today and tomorrow.

An established research leader in clean energy, EV and battery technology and sustainable construction, RRC Polytech is unleashing the power of pan-Canadian collaboration to make housing more affordable, catalyze change in the construction sector and create new jobs in the skilled trades.

With support from a $11.3 million investment from the Government of Canada’s Sectoral Workforce Solutions Program, RRC Polytech is joining its Canadian Colleges for a Resilient Recovery (C2R2) partners in a national green construction training initiative to upskill and reskill Canadians to build and retrofit homes and buildings that reduce energy consumption in pursuit of the ambitious targets of net-zero emissions by 2050 and a net-zero electricity system by 2035.

Home to Manitoba’s only Building Efficiency Technology Access Centre, RRC Polytech will use the funds announced last week to drive economic growth while helping Canada meet its climate and housing goals by working with its industry and academic partners to develop and deliver practical, innovative training in sustainable construction.

“This nation-wide training initiative is the latest example of how RRC Polytech’s flexible learning model and vast applied research facilities and expertise — combined with our commitment to foster collaboration with industry, communities and government — uniquely positions us to not only support but to lead the low-carbon transition,” says Fred Meier, RRC Polytech’s President and CEO.

Net metering is a billing structure where utilities credits owners of solar arrays for the electricity they send to the grid.
(Read: What is solar net metering?)
Before 2014, NREL found that around 84% of U.S. households lived in states with statewide net metering requirements.
Net metering is largely viewed as an administratively simple and acceptable default rate for residential solar adopters, NREL said.","Rooftop solar causes impacts consumers without solar by less than a dollar per monthly electric bill in most states, found a new qualitative analysis by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL).

NREL launched the study due to many states revising net metering policies following arguments between stakeholders over whether net metering increases costs for residents without rooftop solar.

Net metering is a billing structure where utilities credits owners of solar arrays for the electricity they send to the grid.

(Read: What is solar net metering?)

Before 2014, NREL found that around 84% of U.S. households lived in states with statewide net metering requirements. However, in recent years, NREL said several states and regulators have replaced net metering with alternative compensation structures that have reduced solar bill savings from what was previously paid with net metering.

These rate revisions have curbed solar adoption in the U.S., NREL said. NREL estimated the share of households living in net metering states had fallen from 84% before 2014 to about 57% by the end of 2023.

(Read: States take closer look at value of solar, net metering policies)

Because proponents for revising net metering argue that it can affect non-solar consumer’s electric rates, NREL analyzed the relationships between state solar deployment levels, potential electricity rate impacts on solar nonadopters and the timing of revisions to net metering policy. For simplicity, NREL used “revisions” to refer to states that once required net metering but later implemented alternative compensation structures. It also excluded states that implemented revisions that affected solar compensation while retaining retail-rate net metering, such as New York and North Carolina.

NREL found that the potential rate impact is less than $1 per month for a typical residential electricity customer in 38 of the 44 states, including 9 of the 12 states that have revised net metering. Only in California, Connecticut and Hawaii did net metering increase regular customers’ bills, an increase of roughly 3% to 15% of the typical bill on average. NREL noted that all three of these states offer bill assistance programs that partly insulate low-income customers from these potential rate impacts. California may be an outlier, with an exceptionally high estimated rate impact due to rate structure impacts that are largely unique to that state, NREL said.

In all 30 states with a solar deployment rate below 3% of households, net metering is unlikely to be associated with an increase in rates of more than $1 per month per customer without solar, the report said. Among states with a solar deployment rate between 3% and 7% of households, NREL estimated that each customer’s bills were impacted by less than $1 per month in two-thirds of the states, and from $2 to $6 per month in one-third of states.

NREL’s estimates exclude rooftop solar’s social and environmental impacts, “which do not directly affect electricity rates but could affect the perceived value of rooftop [solar] and of rate structures that enable its deployment.”

NREL said 12 states have replaced net metering with alternative rate structures that reduce solar adopter bill savings. Of these 12 states, nine did so when residential deployment was 3% or less. Additionally, NREL found that prior to its replacement, net metering likely only impacted each customer’s bill by less than $1 per month.

NREL said rooftop solar’s impacts on utility cost recovery can be mitigated and managed through rate design that effectively forecasts solar adoption and the changing use patterns of solar adopters. However, in practice, NREL said, the under-recovery of forecasted revenues from solar adopters may cause rate designers to reallocate utility cost recovery among customer classes. Some stakeholders argue this reallocation of costs increases the rates of customers without solar, NREL said. These potential cost allocations are often called “cost shifts,” however, NREL chose not to use this term because “the under-recovery of revenues for costs allocated to PV adopters may or may not ultimately drive a cost shift in the sense that PV adopters do not pay for a service provided on their behalf.”

Net metering has been a key enabler of residential solar adoption in the U.S. because solar adopters realize long-term electricity bill savings, NREL said. Net metering is largely viewed as an administratively simple and acceptable default rate for residential solar adopters, NREL said.

“The timing and nature of net metering revisions are ultimately policy decisions based on balancing state-level priorities and considerations and the potential costs and benefits of different rate structures,” NREL said.

NREL said its qualitative methods did not account for rooftop solar’s broader social and environmental benefits because they do not affect electrical rates specifically. “Still, the estimated social and environmental benefits of rooftop [solar] can be substantial,” NREL said.

A Tennessee department head is hopeful that new guidance for a federal program supporting the growth of electric vehicle charging networks may ultimately allow the state to proceed with $21 million in contracts that have been frozen since February.

The National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Program (NEVI) allocated $88 million to Tennessee over five years to fund EV charger installation along major interstates and Hwy. 64, which runs from Memphis to Pelham roughly along Tennessee’s southern border. The Tennessee Department of Transportation (TDOT) awarded $21 million of the funding to 10 applicants in January 2024 to install 30 new charging locations, each with ports to charge several vehicles, but the contracts were not executed before the federal program’s pause.

Those contracts would complement the state’s own EV charging infrastructure grant program, part of an overall push to support EV adoption. Tennessee’s EV manufacturing industry has grown over the last several years – often supported by state incentives to bring hundreds of jobs to rural communities – giving the state an economic interest in the vehicles’ success. Ford’s new BlueOval City facility in rural West Tennessee recently delayed mass production of its full-size electric truck until 2028 as the company refocuses on the production of cheaper, smaller models in Kentucky.

The $5 billion NEVI program has officially been on ice since February 2025, when the U.S. Federal Highway Administration officially suspended funding to comply with President Donald Trump’s executive order to pause federal grants supporting electric vehicles and clean energy.

Multiple states have challenged the Trump administration’s ability to freeze the funds in federal court. Tennessee is not among them.

U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean P. Duffy recently released interim guidance for the program intending to “streamline applications, provide states with more flexibility, and slash red tape,” according to the federal transportation department.

States can reapply for funding under the new requirements over the next 30 days.

Tennessee program makes progress on EV chargers while frozen federal projects languish

Tennessee Department of Transportation Director Beth Emmons said the department is reviewing the new guidance and updated requirements and “hopes to have a path forward with this program by the time the guidelines become official.”

The program’s deployment has been slow. Less than 400 charging ports funded under NEVI are complete and open for use, according to a dashboard maintained by EV States Clearinghouse. The federal government allocated $3.3 billion to states for fiscal years 2022 through 2025. Of the 38 states that have issued awards under previously approved plans (which must now be resubmitted), 16 states have at least one operational station. States have awarded a total $544 million.

The revised guidance went into effect on Aug. 13, and the Federal Highway Administration is accepting comments on the rule changes through Aug. 27.

“If Congress is requiring the federal government to support charging stations, let’s cut the waste and do it right,” Duffy said in a statement released Aug. 11. “The Biden-Buttigieg Administration failed to deliver EV chargers despite their promises … While I don’t agree with subsidizing green energy, we will respect Congress’ will and make sure this program uses federal resources efficiently.”

Changes include scrapping language regarding serving “rural, underserved, and disadvantaged communities,” “equitable distribution,” and opportunities for minority- and women-owned small businesses. The guidance also removes requirements for states to “address consumer protections, emergency evacuation plans, environmental siting, resilience and terrain considerations.”

Charging industry coalition welcomes changes, nonprofit says new requirements are another stall tactic

Charge Ahead Partnership, a coalition supporting a nationwide EV charging network, welcomed the new guidance.

Slow uptake by states in NEVI’s first three years was due to “requirements within the original guidance that slowed down deployment,” according to a coalition statement released Aug. 13.

“The ultimate goal of the NEVI program is to expand the nation’s EV charging infrastructure, and these updated guidelines will make that outcome more likely,” Charge Ahead Partnership Executive Director Jay Smith said. “A streamlined NEVI program will make it easier for the mom-and-pop gas station on the corner, along with national retail chains, to offer EV charging.”

The coalition is particularly optimistic about guidance encouraging states to prioritize applicants who will serve as the site host and charging provider, a move they say will cut down on time that would otherwise be spent searching for a site, and allow for simpler accountability.

The Sierra Club, one of several nonprofit groups that have joined legal challenges against the funding freeze, contends that the new guidance is “unnecessary” and serves only to further delay EV charging buildout as states reapply for funds.

“It’s ironic that this guidance was sold as cutting red tape, yet all it has accomplished is more than half a year of needless delay,” Sierra Club Clean Transportation for All Director Katherine Garcia stated in a news release.

“While the Trump administration has moved away from anti-EV rhetoric in this guidance in response to federal litigation filed by over a dozen states, Sierra Club, and other nonprofit organizations, it is still illegally withholding billions Congress dedicated to EV charging.”

Separate state program continues charger rollout

In the meantime, Tennessee’s separately funded Fast Charge TN program has supported EV charger installation in a 400-mile loop connecting Nashville, Knoxville, Cookeville and Chattanooga.

The state program is powered by money from the Volkswagen Diesel Settlement Environmental Mitigation Trust, electricity revenues from TVA and cost share from grant recipients. It aims to position an EV charger every 50 miles along Tennessee interstates and highways.

Under Fast Charge TN’s first round, 35 charging sites are operational and 18 more are under development.

The Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation, which oversees the Fast Charge TN program, announced on Friday that it will extend its application period for the second round of funding through Sept. 19 at 4 p.m.

This round will prioritize charging locations in areas that the department anticipates will not be served by the NEVI program.",https://media.zenfs.com/en/tennessee_lookout_articles_119/7b4f0ee31780b0d465b4b5ddfc785451,N,,2025-08-25 12:15:58.559893

For investors, this transition presents both opportunities and risks, particularly as supply chain vulnerabilities and regulatory shifts reshape the automotive and energy sectors. The UK, a key player in this transformation, is leveraging fiscal reforms, infrastructure investments, and strategic industrial policies to position itself at the forefront of the EV revolution.

Policy Shifts and Fiscal Realignment

The UK's 2025 policy updates signal a pragmatic approach to EV adoption. The removal of tax exemptions for EVs—replacing them with a £10 first-year charge and a £195 annual surcharge—reflects a shift in fiscal priorities. These funds are being redirected to infrastructure projects like the EV Chargepoint Grant, which supports home charging for renters and flat dwellers. Meanwhile, the Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) mandate, requiring 52% of new car sales to be zero-emission by 2028, is being met with a flexible credit-borrowing system, allowing manufacturers to balance short-term challenges with long-term compliance.

Globally, the EU's tightening CO₂ fleet-average targets and the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) are creating a regulatory mosaic that demands adaptability. For instance, the IRA's $115 billion in clean energy investments since 2022 has spurred domestic battery and EV manufacturing, with U.S. production capacity projected to meet 60-67% of projected ZEV sales by 2035. These policies are not just reshaping markets—they're redefining supply chains.

Supply Chain Resilience: A New Frontier

The EV supply chain remains a critical battleground. The UK's reliance on imported batteries and raw materials—compounded by geopolitical risks and transport bottlenecks—has prompted a £2.5 billion R&D investment and a £1.2 billion annual skills fund under its 2025 Industrial Strategy. This push for domestic production of high-value components, such as batteries and advanced semiconductors, is mirrored globally. For example, Northvolt's gigafactories in Sweden and Britishvolt's UK operations are scaling lithium-ion production, while sodium-ion and lithium iron phosphate (LFP) technologies are gaining traction as alternatives to reduce mineral dependency.

However, challenges persist. The UK's public charging infrastructure, though growing by 29% year-on-year, still lags in regions like Northern Ireland. A £400 million fund aims to address this disparity, but bottlenecks in grid connectivity and raw material sourcing remain. Investors must weigh these risks against the potential of firms that prioritize supply chain diversification and innovation.

Corporate Adaptation: Governance and Innovation in Action

UK automotive firms are recalibrating their strategies to align with regulatory and market demands. Jaguar Land Rover and Nissan are transitioning production lines to electric platforms, supported by government grants and private investment. Luxury brands like McLaren and Aston Martin are electrifying high-performance models, leveraging the UK's heritage in automotive excellence. Meanwhile, Chinese entrants such as BYD and Omoda are disrupting the market with competitively priced EVs, forcing traditional OEMs to accelerate innovation.

In the energy sector, companies like BP Pulse and Pod Point are expanding ultra-rapid charging networks, while Enel X integrates smart-grid technology to optimize renewable energy use. These firms are not just building infrastructure—they're embedding themselves into the energy transition's fabric.

For investors, governance and regulatory alignment are paramount. The UK's DRIVE35 program, which allocates £2 billion to build a competitive EV manufacturing sector, underscores the importance of firms that collaborate with policymakers. Similarly, CA Auto Finance's tailored EV finance packages and A Better Drive's streamlined retail models highlight the need for agility in addressing consumer adoption barriers.

Strategic Investment Opportunities

The EV transition offers a spectrum of investment avenues:

1. EV Manufacturers: Firms like Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) and Volkswagen (ETR: VOWG_p) are scaling production, but investors should also consider niche players like McLaren (LON: MCW) and emerging Chinese brands such as BYD (SHSE: 601127).

2. Battery Producers: Northvolt (NASDAQ: NVT) and Britishvolt are key players in the UK's domestic battery push, while LFP specialists like CATL (SHSE: 300750) offer exposure to alternative chemistries.

3. Charging Infrastructure: BP Pulse and Enel X are expanding rapidly, with the latter's integration of V2G services adding a revenue stream.

4. Energy Integration: Companies like Enel X and Next Kraftwerke (FRA: NKW) are pioneering grid flexibility solutions, aligning with the UK's V2G ambitions.

Risks and Mitigation

While the EV transition is inevitable, risks abound. Supply chain disruptions, such as the recent cancellation of $6.9 billion in U.S. clean energy projects, highlight the fragility of current strategies. Additionally, policy shifts—like the UK's phased tax reforms—could alter market dynamics. Investors should prioritize firms with diversified supply chains, strong R&D pipelines, and regulatory foresight.

Conclusion: Aligning with the Future

The EV transition is not just a technological shift—it's a reconfiguration of global industries. For investors, the key lies in identifying firms that combine governance, innovation, and regulatory alignment. The UK's strategic investments in R&D, skills, and infrastructure, coupled with global policy momentum, create a fertile ground for long-term growth. By focusing on companies that address supply chain resilience and leverage emerging technologies, investors can navigate the EV transition with confidence.

The DOE said it is establishing the Defense Production Act (DPA) Consortium and will seek voluntary agreements with US companies.

Under the consortium, voluntary agreements will allow industry consultation to develop plans of action to ensure that the nuclear fuel supply chain capacity for mining and milling, conversion, enrichment, deconversion, fabrication, recycling and reprocessing is available to enable the continued reliable operation of the nation’s reactors.

The DOE said its office of nuclear energy will be working with industry participants in the coming weeks to identify participants as well as near and long-term goals. The first meeting of the consortium is on 14 October 2025.

“There are major gaps in our nuclear fuel cycle infrastructure that leave the United States heavily dependent on foreign sources of enriched uranium,” said acting assistant energy secretary Mike Goff.

He said that by using the Defense Production Act, the DOE will be able to take swift action to bring all parties to the table to “accelerate our path toward a more secure and independent energy future.”

The Defense Production Act, enacted in 1950, grants the president authority to ensure the supply of materials and services essential for national defence. It has been expanded to include domestic emergencies and public health crises.

Recent executive orders issued by Donald Trump included an order for the energy secretary to prioritise agreements for the procurement of low-enriched uranium (LEU) and Haleu fuel.

FAQs About Ucore's Louisiana Rare Earth Project

What specific rare earth elements will the Louisiana facility process?

The facility will focus primarily on heavy rare earth elements (HREEs), with particular emphasis on terbium and dysprosium. These elements are critical for high-performance permanent magnets used in defense and advanced technology applications, where their unique properties enable miniaturization and operation in extreme environments.

How does the RapidSX™ technology differ from conventional rare earth processing?

RapidSX™ technology accelerates the traditional solvent extraction process through proprietary column design and process innovations. This reportedly achieves separation speeds 10-20 times faster than conventional methods while requiring a smaller physical footprint and reducing solvent consumption. The technology maintains the chemical selectivity advantages of conventional solvent extraction while addressing its major operational limitations.

When is the Louisiana facility expected to begin production?

While specific production timelines depend on various factors including construction progress and equipment delivery schedules, the current Phase 2 implementation focuses on construction, commissioning, and early production readiness. According to Ucore's groundbreaking ceremony announcement, initial operations could commence following the completion of this phase, with capacity expansion continuing in subsequent development stages.

How will the facility source its rare earth feedstock?

Ucore is developing a multipronged approach to feedstock sourcing, likely including supply agreements with existing rare earth miners in North America and potentially from international sources aligned with U.S. security interests. The company's long-term strategy includes potential integration with its own Bokan-Dotson Ridge project in Alaska, which contains significant heavy rare earth resources.

What impact could this project have on rare earth prices and availability?

By establishing domestic processing capacity for heavy rare earths, the project could help stabilize North American supply and potentially moderate price volatility. While the initial production volumes may represent a small percentage of global capacity, the strategic importance of these materials means even limited domestic production capabilities provide significant supply chain resilience benefits for critical applications.

How does this project fit with broader U.S. critical minerals policy?

The Louisiana SMC aligns directly with evolving U.S. policy priorities aimed at reducing dependence on foreign sources for critical minerals. The substantial DoD funding reflects recognition of rare earth processing as a strategic capability rather than simply a commercial activity. The project demonstrates the practical implementation of policy objectives through US production executive order and Trump's critical minerals order, creating targeted investment in technological solutions.

Switching to a hybrid pickup would reduce that by 23%, while a fully electric pickup represented a 75% drop.","Drivers can now compare the greenhouse gas emissions of different vehicles based on size, usage, powertrain type and even location

Choosing a more electrified vehicle will reduce drivers’ greenhouse gas emissions, regardless of where they live in the contiguous United States, according to a new study from the University of Michigan.

The analysis is the most comprehensive to date, the authors said, providing drivers with estimates of emissions per mile driven across 35 different combinations of vehicle class and powertrains. That included conventional gas pickups, hybrid SUVs and fully electric sedans with dozens of other permutations.

In fact, the team created a free online calculator that lets drivers estimate greenhouse gas emissions based on what they drive, how they drive and where they live.

The work, which was published in the journal Environmental Science & Technology, was supported by the State of Michigan Department of Labor and Economic Opportunity and the U-M Electric Vehicle Center.

“Vehicle electrification is a key strategy for climate action. Transportation accounts for 28% of greenhouse gas emissions and we need to reduce those to limit future climate impacts such as flooding, wildfires and drought events, which are increasing in intensity and frequency,” said Greg Keoleian, senior author of the new study and a professor at the U-M School for Environment and Sustainability, or SEAS.

“Our purpose here was to evaluate the cradle-to-grave greenhouse gas reduction from the electrification of vehicles compared with a baseline of gasoline-powered vehicles.”

In addition to helping drivers understand their emissions, Keoleian and colleagues said this information will be valuable to the automotive industry and policymakers.

While EVs are driving into headwinds from a federal policy standpoint, the industry is committed to electrification, Keoleian said. As an example, Ford Motor Co. recently announced plans for a more affordable electric vehicle platform in what it called a “Model T moment” for the company.

“The government is backing off incentives, like the electric vehicle tax credit, but the original equipment manufacturers are heavily invested and focused on the technology and affordability of EVs,” said Keoleian, who is also a co-director of the U-M Center for Sustainable Systems, or CSS. “EVs are becoming the dominant powertrain in other parts of the world and manufacturers recognize that is the future for the U.S.”

The research team at U-M also included CSS/SEAS research specialists Christian Hitt and Timothy Wallington, as well as postdoctoral fellow Maxwell Woody and Alan Taub, professor in materials science and engineering. Taub is also the director of the U-M Electric Vehicle Center. Hyung Chul Kim, a research scientist at Ford, was another collaborator and Elizabeth Smith is the lead author, who worked on the project as a master’s student at U-M before graduating in May.

A high trim level lifecycle analysis

In their “cradle-to-grave” analysis, Keoleian and colleagues studied emissions numbers not just from driving vehicles, but also from making and disposing of them. In doing so, they considered an array of factors: powertrains, vehicle class, driving behavior and location.

The powertrains included conventional internal combustion engines, hybrid electric, plug-in hybrids, and fully electric, or battery electric. Vehicles with these powertrains are abbreviated ICEV, HEV, PHEV, and BEV, respectively. For vehicle class, they considered pickups, sedans and sport utility vehicles (they considered “generic” versions of these vehicles produced in 2025, which are representative of new vehicles in the marketplace).

Driving behavior included familiar factors such as highway vs. city driving, but also more modern considerations, like location of the vehicle and how often drivers of PHEVs were driving on battery power vs. gasoline.

Location affects emissions in two ways, Keoleian said. First, all vehicles—especially BEVs and PHEVs—use more fuel at lower temperatures and have lower range in locations with lower temperatures. Second, power grid emissions vary by location, so charging EVs in a county with a cleaner grid would emit less greenhouse gas.

In addressing all these variables in a single study, the researchers could make comparisons of emissions from different vehicles in an apples-to-apples way. This enables a detailed comparison of, say, a gasoline-powered pickup in Perry County, Pennsylvania, with a fully electric compact sedan in San Juan County, New Mexico.

In addition to these detailed comparisons, the work also afforded important big-picture takeaways. The study showed for the first time that BEVs have lower emissions over their lifetime than any other vehicle type in every county in the contiguous U.S. On average, ICE pickup trucks were the highest emitters at 486 grams of carbon dioxide equivalent—a measure of greenhouse gas emissions—per mile. Switching to a hybrid pickup would reduce that by 23%, while a fully electric pickup represented a 75% drop.

Another eye-catching stat came in the team’s analysis of how emissions changed while a pickup was hauling weight. A BEV pickup truck carrying 2,500 pounds still emitted less than 30% of an ICE pickup with no cargo.

Overall, compact sedan EVs had the lowest emissions at just 81 grams of carbon dioxide equivalent per mile—less than 20% of the per mile emissions of a gas-powered pickup. The lowest emission vehicle class was the compact sedan BEV with the lowest range, 200 miles. The emissions associated with producing batteries for vehicles with longer ranges bumped up their lifetime greenhouse gas contributions.

That also highlights another big take-away from the study, Keoleian said. Besides electrifying your ride, picking the smallest vehicle that suits your purposes will also reduce emissions.

“The thing is really matching your vehicle with your needs,” Keoleian said. “Obviously, if you’re in the trades, you may need a pickup truck. But you can get a battery electric pickup truck. If you’re just commuting to work by yourself, I’d recommend a sedan BEV instead.”

With the team’s online calculator, people who are interested in vehicle emissions can get answers personalized for their situations.

Meta will purchase the so-called renewable energy credits associated with the project as the social media company works toward its goal of carbon neutrality.
Silicon Ranch declined to disclose the exact size and location of the solar project beyond saying it will follow industry standards.
The agency does not measure how much acreage solar projects take up in the state.
Ott said, luckily, Orangeburg County has an ordinance in place with rules for how solar projects can be built.","Funding from Facebook is helping to pay for a $100 million solar project in central South Carolina that otherwise would have cost power companies too much to build.

Power companies expect to ink similar deals on future solar projects in the state, particularly as construction delays and tariffs drive up prices and Congress rolls back federal tax credits incentivizing these projects, according to Cole Price, executive vice president of member services at Central Electric Power Cooperative.

Similar to how angel investors helped Facebook get started, the social media platform and other tech companies are filling a similar role for the solar industry.

Facebook’s parent company, Meta, signed a contract last week with solar developer Silicon Ranch, of Nashville, and Columbia-based Central Electric Cooperative for the 100 megawatt project.

The companies’ agreement with Meta comes a year after the social media giant announced it was building a massive, energy-intensive data center near Aiken to keep its online operations humming.

Data centers gobble up energy. Should SC block them from getting special deals?

“We’re grateful to Central for supporting our energy goals in South Carolina and thrilled to expand our relationship with Silicon Ranch, who shares our commitment to have a positive impact in the communities where we locate,” Head of Global Energy at Meta Urvi Parekh said in a statement.

‘If not for Meta’

Silicon Ranch will finance, build, own and operate the new solar project. They’ll hook into state owned power-company Santee Cooper’s grid, which in turn will deliver the power to all 19 rural electric cooperatives across South Carolina.

That includes Aiken Electric Cooperative, which serves Meta’s $800 million data center under construction in Graniteville’s Sage Mill Industrial Park.

“This announcement is another step forward for this transformative project,” said Gary Stooksbury, CEO of the Aiken cooperative.

Meta will purchase the so-called renewable energy credits associated with the project as the social media company works toward its goal of carbon neutrality.

Once electricity enters the grid, it is impossible to know where each megawatt comes from — power from solar, gas, wind and coal become jumbled together in the power lines that zigzag across the state. So these credits, which companies sell separately and in addition to the actual energy that shows up on customers’ monthly power bills, allow their purchaser to claim ownership of the underlying social and environmental benefits of clean energy.

Developers put the money generated from the sale of those credits toward purchasing land and building the solar array, which in this case will be located some 50 miles east of Meta’s data center. Through this deal, Meta is buying down the solar project’s cost of construction, making it financially feasible.

“If not for Meta, this renewable resource would not make sense,” said state Sen. Russell Ott, D-St. Matthews, who confirmed the solar project would be located near the small town of Cordova, just outside Orangeburg.

Silicon Ranch declined to disclose the exact size and location of the solar project beyond saying it will follow industry standards. That puts its footprint somewhere between 800 and 1,000 acres.

The company is expected to receive property tax breaks for the project but details of that deal were not immediately available. Orangeburg County officials did not respond to messages from the SC Daily Gazette.

Both the solar array and the data center are expected to be completed in 2027.

Rural solar concerns

This marks Silicon Ranch’s fourth renewable energy venture with Central Electric and its 18th deal with Meta totaling $22.5 billion across four states. It’s Meta’s first in the Palmetto State.

“I’m hoping this is a good deal for everyone,” Ott said. “We need to make sure any solar project built does not inflate bills for the rest of customers.”

Elsewhere in South Carolina, Silicon Ranch is developing a 200-megawatt solar farm on 2,000 acres in inland Georgetown County’s Lambertown community.

SC’s state-owned utility enacts higher rates for data centers, large users

That project, similar to other larger solar developments in rural areas across the country, has faced opposition from nearby residents. About 150 people signed a petition in 2022 opposing the project, citing loss of agriculture and timber land, loss of wildlife habitat and aesthetic impacts on the rural landscape.

Utility-scale solar accounted for more than 1,500 megawatts of power in South Carolina as of July 31, 2024, according to data from the state’s utility watchdog. The agency does not measure how much acreage solar projects take up in the state.

Ott said, luckily, Orangeburg County has an ordinance in place with rules for how solar projects can be built. For those counties that don’t have rules, legislators set them at the state level to address these concerns as part of a massive energy package passed in May.

Those rules require, for any project that takes up 13 or more acres, that solar panels be positioned 50 feet from the road and 200 feet from any homes, churches or schools. Trees and vegetation must be planted that will grow at least two feet higher than the tallest solar panel. Developers must also put up six-foot-high fences.

“I’m not opposed to solar but I want to make sure it is done the right way,” Ott said of the rules.

Silicon Ranch, according to its announcement, will plant pasture grasses and flowering plants beneficial to bees and other pollinators under and around its solar array.

Google announces $3.3B investment in SC data centers, 200 new jobs

Rising costs and expiring credits

Officials in Georgetown County also dinged Silicon Ranch for construction delays that put that project more than a year behind schedule. The company cited permitting issues, as well as supply delays that have plagued solar companies nationwide.

According to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, developers across the U.S. pushed back 19% of planned projects in 2023, a slight improvement over the 23% of projects delayed the year before.

With those delays have come slightly higher prices. Solar cost about $1,600 per killowatt to construct in 2022, a 1.7% increase compared to a year prior, according to federal data.

Meanwhile, the GOP megalaw signed by President Donald Trump last month ends tax credits for wind and solar projects years earlier than planned under Biden’s hallmark clean energy package of 2022.

The program offered a 30% federal tax credit tax on investments. It also included separate credits based on the amount of energy produced – 3 cents per kilowatt hour.

Under changes in the “big, beautiful” law, those projects must be up and running by the end of 2027 to qualify.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Meta-Aiken-Data-Center_Aerial_2-2048x1152.jpg,N,,2025-08-25 08:01:37.285797

It's ""a level of precision critical for reliable EV range estimation,"" per the summary.
For Huaiyin's part, the findings are evidence that battery and EV makers could benefit from improved state-of-charge monitors.
""This technology promises to … accelerate our transition to sustainable transportation and energy systems,"" the experts wrote, per EurekAlert!.","Nothing can ruin a good electric vehicle road trip like a faulty charge gauge that leaves you stranded.

The answer to that travel woe could come from China, where experts are creating better EV state-of-charge monitors, according to research published by EurekAlert!.

Precise accuracy has been a challenge for EV and larger storage packs due to the ""dynamic nature of battery behavior,"" experts from Huaiyin Institute of Technology said in the summary. Their research included a ""novel approach"" using gas-liquid dynamics and an advanced filtering algorithm that helps track and predict data called the Kalman filter.

""The feat … can deliver extended EV range confidence,"" Interesting Engineering wrote.

The team listed four key improvements. First, the error rate was tested at just 1.6%. It's ""a level of precision critical for reliable EV range estimation,"" per the summary.

Second, the team's monitor can correct significant errors in just five seconds. Other gauges take around 100 seconds to self-correct. Third, the state-of-charge measurement remains accurate as the battery ages, resulting in just a 2.5% error rate when the pack drops to 60% of its original capacity. Lastly, the invention is especially reliable with ""sparse data … demonstrating exceptional stability,"" per the experts.

The breakthrough could also increase fast-charging ability and promote better battery health. The team intends for the device to enhance motorists' trust in the key gauge, reducing so-called range anxiety and encouraging more people to switch to cleaner rides.

What's more, the tech is intended to be applicable for emerging battery chemistries, making for a universal device, per EurekAlert!.

EVs are already reliable, cleaner alternatives to exhaust-fuming gas-guzzlers. The U.S. Department of Energy reported that model year 2024 EVs set a median range record, at 283 miles, which is more than the average American's commute. Kelley Blue Book listed the daily travel log for most people at less than 40 miles, for reference. Certain models are capable of far greater distances than even the median. And batteries that can charge in under five minutes are in development.

The efficient rides save motorists about $1,500 a year in gas and maintenance costs, along with preventing thousands of pounds of harmful tailpipe gases, per DOE data. Harvard research published in 2021 reported that decreased exhaust was linked to fewer air-pollution-related deaths.

The benefits can be extended with home-based solar, as the free energy can be used to charge vehicles. Tax breaks worth thousands of dollars for both EVs and solar panels expire on Sept. 30 and Dec. 31, respectively. EnergySage is a trusted resource for home solar quotes, pro installer referrals, and advice that can save you thousands on panel installation.

As far as better gauges, it might be a while before improved tech from China arrives stateside. Tariffs that span multiple administrations have limited the availability of Chinese EVs and related products to American consumers. Business Insider and Reuters reported that the levies are in part designed to foster the growth of a domestic supply chain for key electronic components. The measures also shield American automakers from competing with cheaper imports.

For Huaiyin's part, the findings are evidence that battery and EV makers could benefit from improved state-of-charge monitors.

The company, specialized in supercomputers and high-performance digital infrastructure, is subject to an acquisition agreement of 64% of its capital by the American company Marathon Digital Holdings (Mara) for an amount of 168 million euros. This operation raises questions about the preservation of high-value technological assets within the national framework.

The ministry specified that the case was still under review and had not been definitively closed. EDF, fully owned by the French state, together with the Agence des participations de l’État (APE, the French State Shareholding Agency), are currently leading discussions linked to this agreement. The official signing between Mara and EDF Pulse Ventures, the group’s venture capital arm, took place on August 11, but several suspensive conditions remain to be validated.

Three scenarios considered by the authorities

According to information provided by the Ministry of Economy, three scenarios are now being considered: the cancellation of the sale, the search for a new investor, potentially European, or the continuation of the initial agreement with Mara. In the latter case, the operation would be subject to the foreign investment control procedure in France (IEF), managed by the General Directorate of the Treasury.

The ministry emphasizes that this procedure could lead to a justified blockage of the transaction if certain national interest or technological sovereignty criteria were deemed compromised. At this stage, the process remains suspended, pending a strategic reassessment by the stakeholders involved.

A technology subsidiary considered non-strategic, yet sensitive

Exaion develops high-performance computing centers used in various sectors, including the digital industry. Although it does not fall within the scope of entities classified as strategic such as EDF or defense companies, the firm holds technological expertise considered potentially critical for the future.

The ministry indicated that, even without strategic status, certain technologies developed by Exaion could justify maintaining partial or complete sovereignty over the company. This dimension is taken into account in the current evaluation of the case by the French authorities.

Strengthened foreign investment control

EDF stated in a press release that the agreement remained subject to several regulatory conditions, including foreign investment control, which applies to this type of operation involving sensitive technologies. In this respect, the Treasury Department is actively monitoring the file to ensure compliance with the legislation in force.

Why strategy can often fail with utilities For today’s power utilities, especially those governed by elected boards or serving highly engaged communities, leadership and board perspectives can vary widely.
This creates organizational inefficiencies, where operational teams invest time and money in projects that lack support or do not align with true strategic priorities.
The hidden cost of misalignment: A case of data center growth Across the United States, power utilities are currently seeing an unprecedented surge in requests from data operations (hyperscalers, edge data centers, data miners, etc.).
Consider an example where a utility board in the northeastern United States enthusiastically supported new data operations to stimulate economic development.","Power utilities today are confronting a perfect storm of explosive demand, aging assets and unpredictable policy shifts, making strategic alignment more critical and more challenging to achieve than ever before. A surge in demand from large, energy-intensive loads, such as data operations, electric vehicle manufacturing and hydrogen production facilities, complicates forecasting and challenges existing planning processes. Simultaneously, aging grid assets, some nearing or exceeding their design lives, are increasingly vulnerable. These technical challenges are compounded by heightened regulatory scrutiny, decarbonization goals and shifting policy around energy affordability, reliability and sustainability. The unique circumstances companies are operating in today make it essential for executive teams to proactively address and shape company strategy.

In today’s dynamic environment, strategic planning must be an essential capability of the executive team. It requires a deliberate, structured approach that is grounded in alignment at the top, provides clarity in execution, resourcing and goals, and sustains leadership attention for frequent assessment and adaptation. Despite the best intentions, strategic initiatives can miss the mark if they lack this foundation.

Why strategy can often fail with utilities

For today’s power utilities, especially those governed by elected boards or serving highly engaged communities, leadership and board perspectives can vary widely. One board member may be exclusively focused on affordability, while another may advocate for decarbonization and renewables integration. These different viewpoints can be a strength in the development of the company strategy, but without an intentional process that drives alignment, they can often create confusion and slow progress.

Common symptoms of executive misalignment include:

Decision-making paralysis, where little progress is made on strategic priorities

Conflicting interpretations leading to diluted execution, as different leaders act on their own interpretations of “the strategy”

Wasted effort, as incomplete or poorly supported initiatives don’t move the needle

Frustration at all levels, as priorities seem to shift and unifying objectives remains unclear

Misalignment is not always the result of disagreement or differences in opinion. It often stems from a lack of consistent and transparent engagement with company leadership. Without a forum to discuss trade-offs, assumptions and risks, organizations will produce strategic plans that look good on paper and likely include “something for everyone” but fail to guide strategic action. This creates organizational inefficiencies, where operational teams invest time and money in projects that lack support or do not align with true strategic priorities.

The hidden cost of misalignment: A case of data center growth

Across the United States, power utilities are currently seeing an unprecedented surge in requests from data operations (hyperscalers, edge data centers, data miners, etc.). While each opportunity promises economic development, they also present seismic shifts in demand profiles, reliability risks and strain on infrastructure. Misaligned planning efforts in this scenario could lead to serious adverse outcomes.

Consider an example where a utility board in the northeastern United States enthusiastically supported new data operations to stimulate economic development. Some executives advocated for “accelerated service” and proposed quick solutions such as backup gas generation and temporary interconnections to fast-track the load and ensure the opportunity was captured. Meanwhile, operations and engineering executives were advocating to prioritize system reliability through capital investment in upgrades and refurbishing aging infrastructure. Ultimately, the utility caved to pressure from the potential new customer and moved forward with the “accelerated service” plan to capture the data operation. Leadership received initial acclaim in the press and with policymakers for enabling “efficient economic growth,” but as the data operations came online, issues arose:

Peak demand surges: Record summer heat coincided with ramping data operation activity. System balancing became fragile, and rolling outages were narrowly avoided using emergency market purchases

Backfeed and grid instability: Temporary interconnections caused unanticipated backfeed in parts of the grid, and the system operator initiated emergency curtailment protocols

Capital cost overruns: Deferred grid upgrades eventually proceeded to address the realization of reliability issues, but the cost was significantly higher due to rushed design work and inflation of material and equipment costs

Public trust and regulator friction: Reliability issues and overspending spurred the state commission to launch an investigation into whether the utility misrepresented system readiness and cost exposure

This scenario reveals an important insight. This utility didn’t fail because it lacked foresight but because its strategic vision was fragmented.

What should utilities do differently?

To successfully navigate an evolving landscape, strategic planning must be treated as a deliberate, structured process and not a one-time document. That process begins with a clear understanding of what strategy is and what it must do:

Diagnose the current state – Why will the status quo no longer work? What disruptions, risks, or opportunities demand a new path?

Establish guiding principles and assumptions – What parameters, trade-offs and guardrails will shape the strategy? What values or priorities are non-negotiable?

Prioritize and sequence strategic inputs – What actions or initiatives will move the strategy forward? In what order and with what resources?

Create alignment through dialogue – How will leaders debate, communicate and sustain a shared understanding of the strategy? What forums or rhythms ensure that alignment holds over time?

Executives and boards must shift from treating strategy as a static plan to a living framework that evolves with conditions and is continuously tested for alignment, clarity and impact.

Tools and tactics for strategic alignment

The following practices are worth considering to create alignment and increase the effectiveness of strategy development and execution:

Structured executive interviews: Conduct confidential discussions with leadership to understand strategic perspectives, identify divergent views and surface areas of friction

Strategic alignment assessment: Measure how aligned executive leadership is by comparing strategic perspectives across functions, business units, etc. This comparison should be used as a foundation to facilitate discussion and debate that creates alignment around strategic priorities and performance gaps

Facilitated retreats or strategy workshops: Create forums away from the daily office grind where leaders can work through differences in real time and build alignment

Performance scorecards: Develop metrics that track progress against strategic priorities

Regular strategic check-ins: Frequently revisit the strategy to ensure it remains aligned with evolving regulatory, financial and system conditions

While Monday’s fuel cost is higher than a week ago, it is approximately the same as a month ago, when the average price for regular gas was $3.16 per gallon. In August, gas prices fluctuated but primarily stayed between $3.13 and $3.16 per gallon. It’s a pattern that has existed all summer as fuel costs have avoided the seasonal gas price hike that traditionally happens after Memorial Day Weekend in May during the summer driving season.

A positive sign on gas prices this month is that they are much cheaper than a year ago, when the average price for a gallon of gas was $3.353, according to AAA. Most experts claim that this year’s affordable fuel costs have to do with the price of crude oil, which currently sits at $63.92 per barrel (at the time of publication of this article). Currently, August’s gas prices are at its lowest for an August since 2020, when it was $2.272, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

In July 2024, the average price for a gallon of regular gas was $3.60. In 2023, fuel costs were higher at $3.712 per gallon. In July 2022, gas prices were near record highs, the second-highest in the country’s history, at $4.668. Comparatively, in July 2021, the average cost for gas was $3.23.

Additionally, regarding gas prices, most analyses suggest a $3 per gallon cost as a reasonable price point in today’s market for evaluating fuel cost affordability in the country. With the price of gas decreasing in recent months, the number of states averaging less than $3 per gallon has increased. However, the number of states with gas at this price point has fluctuated over the summer.

On June 30, there were 21 states with statewide average gas prices under $3. In early July, the number of states at this threshold dropped to 20. In mid-July, it increased again to 22 states. On the penultimate day of July, it was back to 23 states, the most states with average gas prices under $3 per gallon since summer began. As of mid-August, there are now 22 states with average gas prices under $3 per gallon. On Monday, that total again dropped to 20 states.

,American Energy,2025-08-25 10:35:04+00:00,STLPR,How Ameren hopes to attract huge data centers and protect customers in Missouri - STLPR,"Kate Grumke, www.stlpr.org, kate-grumke",,,,,https://www.stlpr.org/health-science-environment/2025-08-25/ameren-missouri-huge-data-centers-protect-customers,"In the meantime, Missouri’s biggest utilities, including Ameren, are working to write new rules to govern how large data centers operate in the state.
Essentially, they are writing terms of service for when large data centers move into their areas and buy their electricity.
Ameren is proposing these requirements for data centers: Sign contracts for a minimum of 15 years of service.
Why this is important Extreme energy use Data centers represent a potentially unprecedented increase in energy use, according to Ameren.
Companies that are building huge data centers, like Amazon and Google, have officially joined the cases in Missouri meaning they will weigh in during proceedings.","In St. Charles this month, crowds of people opposing a proposed large data center showed up to public meetings to voice their concerns.

They decried the secretive nature of the project, whose owner still hasn’t been revealed, and its potential impact on water quality.

The residents were also worried that their energy bills might go up because of the data center’s potentially huge demand for electricity. The developer pulled the proposal for now but says it will be back.

In the meantime, Missouri’s biggest utilities, including Ameren, are working to write new rules to govern how large data centers operate in the state. Advocates hope the new policies could also protect regular utility customers, like the ones who showed up in St. Charles.

What’s happening

Two of Missouri’s largest utilities, Ameren in the east and Evergy in the west, are both in the middle of Large Load Customer Tariff cases before Missouri’s utility regulator, the Public Service Commission. Essentially, they are writing terms of service for when large data centers move into their areas and buy their electricity.

This process was spurred, in part, by the Missouri legislature passing a new utility law in March. SB4 requires large utilities to write tariffs, which are effectively terms of service, for customers requesting more than 100 megawatts of energy, to make sure that existing customers' rates don’t reflect any “unjust or unreasonable” cost.

In filings before the PSC, Ameren representatives write that they are trying to balance two goals: attracting these new data center businesses and doing it in a way that minimizes risk.

“We need to have a framework where we can actually get some assurance about their commitment to the region before we make the investments in some of the infrastructure we need to serve them,” said Steve Wills, senior director of regulatory affairs for Ameren Missouri.

To attract the businesses, the utilities are offering to build new power plants to meet their large energy demands, write clear policies for large customers and create subscription programs for renewable energy.

To minimize risk, the utilities are making rules to protect other customers from footing the bill if the data centers don’t actually move in, or if they leave early. Ameren is proposing these requirements for data centers:

Sign contracts for a minimum of 15 years of service.

Commit to buying a minimum level of energy that is 70% of what they are contracted for.

Post collateral or have a minimum credit rating to come in.

Give two years' notice before terminating their agreements and would have to pay exit fees that would cover their minimum demand obligations for at least five years or the rest of their contract.

Ameren also wants data centers to sign Electric Service Agreements that would be approved by the Public Service Commission, giving state regulators a say over the terms of these data center agreements.

Why this is important

Extreme energy use

Data centers represent a potentially unprecedented increase in energy use, according to Ameren.

“They're really unique in terms of their service characteristics,” Wills said. “And by unique, I mean, it's really just the size of them. They're very, very large.”

In 2024, the largest individual Ameren customer had a peak electricity demand of 32MW. The company is writing these policies for customers requesting 100MW or more.

These rules will likely apply mostly to large data centers, but there is a possibility that other large industrial customers might need this level of service.

In its filings, Ameren said it already has large energy customers knocking at its doors, and some have taken steps to commit their business. The company has five projects that would fall under this Large Load Rate Plan, totaling 2,270MW of demand, and that have taken steps to commit to build.

That level of new energy demand will necessitate new energy sources, like power plants. So Ameren would need to build.

In most cases, costs for new power plants and other infrastructure are spread out among all customers through rate increases. But in this case, the investments are so large, the utilities need to make sure the data centers foot the bill for infrastructure that is only going in because of their demand.

“We're going to do everything that we possibly can to reasonably ensure that these customers are paying their fair share, and that we're not unjustly passing costs on to other customers,” said Rob Dixon, Ameren’s senior director for economic, community and business development.

If the rules are set up well, there is a possibility that these huge new customers could lower costs for everyone, said Geoff Marke, chief economist with Missouri Office of Public Counsel, the ratepayer advocate before the Public Service Commission.

“Over time, in theory, it should lower the overall bills for customers if it's done correctly,” Marke said. “It's really an economy of scale argument more than anything, and an argument for utilities period is bigger is better in terms of being able to spread out cost and investments.”

Speculative nature

The speculative nature of data centers represents a uniquely risky situation for utilities and their customers, said Jeremy Fisher, the Sierra Club’s principal adviser for climate and energy.

As companies shop around for data center locations, they’re asking utilities for information in multiple places. Fisher said the Sierra Club is tracking 23 utilities that have announced 700 gigawatts of demand in their economic development pipelines, which would represent more power than the U.S. currently uses.

“It is ridiculous to imagine that the data center sector is going to consume more electricity than all Americans consume today,” Fisher added.

Even if they do move in, data centers could ultimately need less energy than they are signaling now. Fisher said there are two factors that could lead to less demand — artificial intelligence could become significantly more efficient, and the companies could end up not succeeding in their market.

Marke said there have been examples in Missouri of large businesses going under and leading to increased energy costs for all customers, like in the case of an aluminum smelter in New Madrid. He worries that could happen with AI, too.

“The AI, the data centers themselves, are part of a competitive marketplace,” said Marke. “So there's no guarantee that each data center, each vendor, AI application, is ultimately going to be successful.”

If data centers don’t end up needing all the energy utilities think they do, it could leave those energy providers without a use or a way to pay for new, expensive power plants. That’s where these large load tariffs could provide protections.

“One of the really positive things about having a large load tariff is that it ensures that the utility isn't building generation and transmission infrastructure on spec, but actually relying on a real market signal before it invests,” Fisher said.

Climate implications

These cases will also potentially have big implications for the greenhouse gas emissions that are driving climate change because energy generation is the second-largest source of those emissions in the U.S.

The huge increase in energy use could be “effectively a rollback of our climate progress as utilities increasingly invest in gas and existing coal to meet those requirements,” Fisher said.

In testimony before the Public Service Commission, Ameren officials repeatedly emphasize that data center customers want renewable energy to power their operations. Dixon wrote that 35% of Ameren’s largest customers have sustainability goals, and large data center operators like Amazon and Google also prioritize renewable energy.

That spurred Ameren to propose four new subscription programs for large load customers to pay extra to receive wind, solar or nuclear energy.

But at the same time, Ameren has announced it will build two new natural gas plants in the coming years and more after that. Natural gas is cleaner than coal but still relies on fossil fuels and contributes to climate change.

Wills said natural gas is needed to fill in the gaps when renewable sources like solar and wind aren’t on.

“You really need to capitalize on the strengths of every different technology that's out there,” Wills said. “And so the natural gas generation is what we call dispatchable, which means it's available on demand.”

In testimony, Ajay Arora, Ameren’s senior vice president and chief development officer, said the company’s plan is to get 70% of its energy from sources that can be turned on immediately, like natural gas or nuclear. The remaining 30% would come from renewables like wind and solar.

What’s next

As both large load rate cases make their way through the regulatory process, outside parties are weighing in on the initial proposals from the utilities and sharing opinions on what they should look like.

Companies that are building huge data centers, like Amazon and Google, have officially joined the cases in Missouri meaning they will weigh in during proceedings. The Sierra Club and Renew Missouri have also done the same. And the case will include input from the Office of Public Counsel, which represents customers in Missouri.

These outside parties will push back, asking for changes in the policies. For example, in Evergy’s case, Marke with the Office of Public Counsel has testified that these data centers should be subject to studies that look at energy efficiency, water use and how data centers might disturb the flow of electricity in the area before and after they are built.

“Right now, I would argue that a lot of this isn't very transparent,” Marke said. “So getting that information out there, making that a priority on the front end, allows us to go ahead and benchmark it, allows us to better plan our finite resources moving forward.”

Much like with a case in a court, briefs will be filed, evidentiary hearings will be held, and eventually the Public Service Commission will approve plans.

Evergy’s case could be on the PSC’s agenda at the end of this year, and Ameren’s will likely come up in the beginning of next year.

What happened: Last week, the Interior Department’s Bureau of Ocean Energy Management said it must review the Danish company’s project, citing “concerns related to the protection of national security interests.” All offshore foundations and 45 out of 65 turbines are already installed, and the project was on track to produce electricity next spring. Once fully operational, the project would power 350,000 homes in Connecticut and Rhode Island.

Freezing wind is in the economic forecast

Nearly $19 billion worth of renewable energy projects have been canceled this year, a 2,149% increase from last year, according to the Financial Times, citing Atlas Public Policy data. And that’s how the Trump administration wants it:

Last week, on Truth Social, President Trump posted, “We will not approve wind or farmer destroying Solar.”

In April, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum temporarily halted New York’s $5 billion Empire Wind project, led by Equinor, but changed course after fierce lobbying from Gov. Kathy Hochul.

How’s business? The Oceantic Network, a trade group for the renewable energy industry, criticized the Trump administration’s move to halt the Rhode Island project for putting American jobs at risk, saying in a statement that Revolution Wind “sparked investments in Louisiana and New England shipyards, the purchase of export cables from a South Carolina factory, and spurred a steel supply chain that crossed New York and created hundreds of union jobs in Providence, Rhode Island.”

It’s also another blow to Ørsted, whose financial health was already declining. Before this news, it was trying to raise $9.4 billion to improve its balance sheet, as doing business in the US got a whole lot tougher in the past year.","https://cdn.sanity.io/images/bl383u0v/production/d0594bd488a9ccfc42b300794ebb2616e0e1e27c-8136x5424.jpg?rect=0,576,8136,4271&w=1200&h=630&q=70&fit=crop&auto=format",N,,2025-08-25 07:04:47.558952

The National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Program (NEVI) allocated $88 million to Tennessee over five years to fund EV charger installation along major interstates and Hwy.
Those contracts would complement the state’s own EV charging infrastructure grant program, part of an overall push to support EV adoption.
Less than 400 charging ports funded under NEVI are complete and open for use, according to a dashboard maintained by EV States Clearinghouse.
This round will prioritize charging locations in areas that the department anticipates will not be served by the NEVI program.","A Tennessee department head is hopeful that new guidance for a federal program supporting the growth of electric vehicle charging networks may ultimately allow the state to proceed with $21 million in contracts that have been frozen since February.

The National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Program (NEVI) allocated $88 million to Tennessee over five years to fund EV charger installation along major interstates and Hwy. 64, which runs from Memphis to Pelham roughly along Tennessee’s southern border. The Tennessee Department of Transportation (TDOT) awarded $21 million of the funding to 10 applicants in January 2024 to install 30 new charging locations, each with ports to charge several vehicles, but the contracts were not executed before the federal program’s pause.

Those contracts would complement the state’s own EV charging infrastructure grant program, part of an overall push to support EV adoption. Tennessee’s EV manufacturing industry has grown over the last several years – often supported by state incentives to bring hundreds of jobs to rural communities – giving the state an economic interest in the vehicles’ success. Ford’s new BlueOval City facility in rural West Tennessee recently delayed mass production of its full-size electric truck until 2028 as the company refocuses on the production of cheaper, smaller models in Kentucky.

The $5 billion NEVI program has officially been on ice since February 2025, when the U.S. Federal Highway Administration officially suspended funding to comply with President Donald Trump’s executive order to pause federal grants supporting electric vehicles and clean energy.

Multiple states have challenged the Trump administration’s ability to freeze the funds in federal court. Tennessee is not among them.

U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean P. Duffy recently released interim guidance for the program intending to “streamline applications, provide states with more flexibility, and slash red tape,” according to the federal transportation department.

States can reapply for funding under the new requirements over the next 30 days.

Tennessee program makes progress on EV chargers while frozen federal projects languish

Tennessee Department of Transportation Director Beth Emmons said the department is reviewing the new guidance and updated requirements and “hopes to have a path forward with this program by the time the guidelines become official.”

The program’s deployment has been slow. Less than 400 charging ports funded under NEVI are complete and open for use, according to a dashboard maintained by EV States Clearinghouse. The federal government allocated $3.3 billion to states for fiscal years 2022 through 2025. Of the 38 states that have issued awards under previously approved plans (which must now be resubmitted), 16 states have at least one operational station. States have awarded a total $544 million.

The revised guidance went into effect on Aug. 13, and the Federal Highway Administration is accepting comments on the rule changes through Aug. 27.

“If Congress is requiring the federal government to support charging stations, let’s cut the waste and do it right,” Duffy said in a statement released Aug. 11. “The Biden-Buttigieg Administration failed to deliver EV chargers despite their promises … While I don’t agree with subsidizing green energy, we will respect Congress’ will and make sure this program uses federal resources efficiently.”

Changes include scrapping language regarding serving “rural, underserved, and disadvantaged communities,” “equitable distribution,” and opportunities for minority- and women-owned small businesses. The guidance also removes requirements for states to “address consumer protections, emergency evacuation plans, environmental siting, resilience and terrain considerations.”

Charging industry coalition welcomes changes, nonprofit says new requirements are another stall tactic

Charge Ahead Partnership, a coalition supporting a nationwide EV charging network, welcomed the new guidance.

Slow uptake by states in NEVI’s first three years was due to “requirements within the original guidance that slowed down deployment,” according to a coalition statement released Aug. 13.

“The ultimate goal of the NEVI program is to expand the nation’s EV charging infrastructure, and these updated guidelines will make that outcome more likely,” Charge Ahead Partnership Executive Director Jay Smith said. “A streamlined NEVI program will make it easier for the mom-and-pop gas station on the corner, along with national retail chains, to offer EV charging.”

The coalition is particularly optimistic about guidance encouraging states to prioritize applicants who will serve as the site host and charging provider, a move they say will cut down on time that would otherwise be spent searching for a site, and allow for simpler accountability.

The Sierra Club, one of several nonprofit groups that have joined legal challenges against the funding freeze, contends that the new guidance is “unnecessary” and serves only to further delay EV charging buildout as states reapply for funds.

“It’s ironic that this guidance was sold as cutting red tape, yet all it has accomplished is more than half a year of needless delay,” Sierra Club Clean Transportation for All Director Katherine Garcia stated in a news release.

“While the Trump administration has moved away from anti-EV rhetoric in this guidance in response to federal litigation filed by over a dozen states, Sierra Club, and other nonprofit organizations, it is still illegally withholding billions Congress dedicated to EV charging.”

Separate state program continues charger rollout

In the meantime, Tennessee’s separately funded Fast Charge TN program has supported EV charger installation in a 400-mile loop connecting Nashville, Knoxville, Cookeville and Chattanooga.

The state program is powered by money from the Volkswagen Diesel Settlement Environmental Mitigation Trust, electricity revenues from TVA and cost share from grant recipients. It aims to position an EV charger every 50 miles along Tennessee interstates and highways.

Under Fast Charge TN’s first round, 35 charging sites are operational and 18 more are under development.

The Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation, which oversees the Fast Charge TN program, announced on Friday that it will extend its application period for the second round of funding through Sept. 19 at 4 p.m.

This round will prioritize charging locations in areas that the department anticipates will not be served by the NEVI program.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-97/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/charging-station001-1024x6831756116263.jpg?h=199d8c1f&itok=igveZ6Qw,N,,2025-08-25 07:04:53.697393

As electric vehicle adoption rises, more Americans will need to clean out their garages.
They are one of three main electric vehicle charging types.
Not owning your own home then “presents a substantial complication to installing EV charging,” Abuelsamid said.
Cox initially estimated July EV sales to be the second-best month ever, with sales over 130,000 vehicles representing a 20% year-over-year increase.","Not owning your own home presents a substantial complication to installing EV charging, according to Telemetry.

Installing in-home chargers can cost on average $2,000.

As electric vehicle adoption rises, more Americans will need to clean out their garages.

This, according to a Michigan-based strategic communications agency's first 2025 EV Charging Market report, is because home charging systems are crucial to courting higher EV sales, and a surprising number of car buyers lack access to a 240-volt outlet close enough to where their car is parked.

While the majority of American homes can support such an outlet, the agency, Telemetry, found that one-third of American homeowners with garages can’t park there.

“You can have a charger outside your garage, or if you don’t have a garage at all, you can get chargers that are mounted outside, they aren’t that much more expensive,” said Sam Abuelsamid, vice president of market research for the agency. Abuelsamid is an analyst with over 11 years of experience conducting similar reports.

""Or, you can adjust your behavior at home and move your stuff,” he added.

The study, compiled by Telemetry using a combination of proprietary forecasting, government data resources from the U.S. and Canada, external industry analysis and journalistic citations, also found:

Direct-current fast chargers make up less than 3.85% of chargers in private networks across the U.S. and Canada and can cost up to $70,000 to install.

Telemetry’s Light Duty Vehicle Forecast projects that EVs are set to represent between 20% and 44% of all new vehicle sales in North America by 2035, a range of 33 million to 57 million EVs.

If electric vehicles rise to reach that market range, a low of 4.7 million and a high of 31.9 million homeowners would need to install at-home chargers by 2035.

The National Renewable Energy Laboratory estimated 42% of homeowners park near existing electrical access that can be modified to work with a Level 2 charger, Telemetry said Aug. 20, noting that the number surges to 68% if homeowners opt to clear out their garage.

Level 2 chargers are found at most public charging stations and are considered the best for at-home charging systems too. They are one of three main electric vehicle charging types. A Level 1 charger, is similar to plugging in a lamp, and takes roughly 20 hours to charge 120 miles. Level 3 fast chargers, meanwhile, can charge an electric vehicle most of the way in less than a half hour.

Financial, structural hurdles

Other findings of the study indicate that electric vehicle ownership still favors Americans who own their homes. Home charging makes up 80% of all electric vehicle charging today, which makes sense, as over 80% of all EV owners own their homes.

“The vast majority of people do not buy new cars and nearly 90% of all EVs on the road were built in the past seven years,” Abuelsamid said. “The people that are buying new cars tend to be a little more affluent.”

Roughly three out of four southeastern Michigan occupied housing units — homes and apartments where people live — had access to a garage or carport in 2023, according to the American Housing Survey of the Census Bureau. But one in four renter households in Michigan spent more than half of their income in 2023 to cover housing costs, which includes rent and utilities.

Not owning your own home then “presents a substantial complication to installing EV charging,” Abuelsamid said.

Data from the U.S. Census Bureau notes that owner-occupied housing in the city of Detroit was 54% in 2023, the latest data available, to 137,567 out of a total 255,857 units. Across Michigan, the owner-occupied housing rates are higher, reaching 73.7% in 2023.

Residential charging remains a challenge for roughly 23% of Americans who rent multifamily residences, such as apartments, according to Telemetry. Of the 20% of new EV purchasers who live in multifamily homes, just 11% report parking near charging access at their residence.

Even for those who own their own homes, the cost of upgrading electrical access for vehicle use may be prohibitive, Abuelsamid pointed out. Older homes may run on limited 100 amp circuit breakers, and the preferred voltage use for adequate home charging can be a substantial drain.

For those with very short commutes, Abuelsamid said, plugging into a standard 120-volt outlet, which adds maybe a mile or two an hour, “might be all you need.”

For those who need more range, upgrades to a home's electrical system could be necessary, and even more expensive if the circuit breaker isn't close enough to where you plan to charge the car.

“If it’s in close proximity to your garage or where you’re going to park, it’s relatively straightforward,” Abuelsamid said. “But if your breaker panel is on the opposite end of your house, that could add hundreds of dollars to the cost of installation just for the wire. If you have to upgrade your panel, now you’re talking potentially thousands of dollars to do that.”

EV sales are soaring

Despite these barriers, Telemetry estimated U.S. EV market share will more than double in 10 years. That is, over 40% of all new vehicle sales a decade from now could be electric, comprising 20% of total sales compared with today’s less than 10%. In the U.S., there are about 305 million registered vehicles, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.

EV sales surged this summer due to the upcoming expiration of the $7,500 EV tax credit after President Donald Trump slashed clean vehicle tax credits under what has been called the “One Big, Beautiful bill.”

Cox Automotive cited an uptick in sales last month as car buyers raced to take advantage of discounts to reach some of the highest new and used EV sales on record. Cox initially estimated July EV sales to be the second-best month ever, with sales over 130,000 vehicles representing a 20% year-over-year increase.

EV adoption is moving slower than automakers anticipated and hasn’t meaningfully grown industrywide outside the current spike, according to Lenny LaRocca, U.S. auto leader at KPMG, the audit, tax and advisory firm.

Even with some of the new launches, “EVs are not at price points the mass market is really excited about, and range anxiety is still a main hurdle to adoption,” LaRocca told the Free Press. “For longer trips, an EV is not the preferred choice right now. Without a reliable network of charging, it really limits the market.”

Across public and private networks in the U.S. and Canada, Telemetry expects installing the proper EV charging equipment to reach the demand expected in 2035 will cost $132.6 billion to $143.1 billion in today’s dollars.

Private homeowners can be expected to pay around $45.4 billion to $50.4 billion of that total, assuming an average of $2,000 per installed charger, the Telemetry study also found.

Intersect’s community benefits spending, she said, is “going directly to highly reputable nonprofits” and community-based organizations that will focus on western Fresno County.
Intersect Power and the Fresno County Fire Protection District said they are still negotiating fire mitigation measures.
Even so, the fire protection district said it will need to build four new stations and hire additional staff as more large clean energy projects are built.","The fallowed farmland — too dry, salty and barren to grow crops — stretches across a remote, sunbaked expanse crisscrossed by rutted dirt roads.

Soon, roughly 15 square miles of these retired agricultural fields in western Fresno County will hold one of the world’s largest solar and battery energy storage projects — a behemoth capable of powering some 850,000 homes for four hours.

The Darden Clean Energy Project, approved by the California Energy Commission in June, is the first development to be fast-tracked under a 2022 state law that allows large renewable energy projects to be reviewed and permitted without sign-off from county and municipal governments.

The Opt-In Certification Program, as it is called, is meant to sidestep the kind of local pushback that can drag on for years. And the Darden project’s approval was touted by Gov. Gavin Newsom as a major victory in helping the state meet its ambitious climate goal of using 100% clean energy by 2045.

But in rural western Fresno County — where energy firms have planned multiple large-scale battery and solar projects — many residents feel blindsided. They have raised serious questions about who benefits and who gets left behind when major projects are fast-tracked.

Espi Sandoval, a board member for the nonprofit Rural Communities Rising, a western Fresno County advocacy group, said the impoverished, mostly Latino area has long been exploited by corporate agriculture and now is playing catch-up as it finds itself suddenly at the forefront of California’s energy transition.

“We’re forgotten by the government. Now we’ve got this private sector coming in with these huge solar panel farms,” said Sandoval, who has lived in western Fresno County since 1972. “I don’t want to see the same exploitation of our people.”

Within a few miles of the Darden site are several tiny farmworker towns, including Cantua Creek, Five Points and Three Rocks (also known as El Porvenir). The solar and lithium-ion battery project will be built within a census tract where more than a third of residents live in poverty — double the rate in Fresno County as a whole.

The nearby towns struggle with poor drinking water and air quality, extreme heat and lack of access to opportunity, dozens of environmental justice groups and community advocates wrote in a letter to Newsom and the Energy Commission as the project was being considered.

In its oversight of the Darden project, they wrote, the state “has the potential to either set the stage for an equitable, just transition or, conversely, to continue patterns of disinvestment in low-income communities of color.”

The Darden project’s owner, IP Darden I, a subsidiary of San Francisco-based Intersect Power, is set to become the second-largest property tax payer in Fresno County, behind Pacific Gas and Electric. Intersect will pay at least $232 million to the county over the next decade, according to an economic impact report by the company.

The project also is projected to generate tens of millions of dollars in local sales tax, including through the purchase of construction equipment and materials, according to Intersect Power. The company said it will create more than 1,200 construction jobs while it is being built and 16 full-time operational jobs once it’s up and running.

Maria Pacheco, the mayor of Kerman, a small city northeast of the Darden site, wrote in a letter to the Energy Commission this spring that the project’s jobs and tax revenue will be transformative for the San Joaquin Valley. They will help provide “essential services and infrastructure improvements, directly benefiting the often-underserved west side,” she wrote.

The stakes are big near Darden, including for Newsom’s plans to expedite other clean energy projects. The Opt-In Certification Program requires environmental reviews to be completed within 270 days of a project application being deemed complete.

Eight other projects, from Imperial County in the south to Shasta County in the north, currently are pursuing approval through the opt-in process. And after significant local pushback, a developer that has been planning to build a lithium-ion battery storage facility on the site where Morro Bay’s iconic smokestacks stand pulled out of the municipal permitting process this spring, indicating it might pursue the state’s fast-track program.

As part of the fast-track process, Intersect Power was required to enter into at least one so-called “community benefits agreement” with a local organization and to provide tangible benefits to the region.

Intersect Power agreed to donate $2 million to local groups over the next 10 years and $5 million over the life of the project.

In a statement to The Times, Elizabeth Knowles, the head of community engagement for Intersect, said the company has been meeting with residents, schools and other local stakeholders since 2023. Intersect’s community benefits spending, she said, is “going directly to highly reputable nonprofits” and community-based organizations that will focus on western Fresno County.

Much of the initial $2 million will be split among Fresno-based nonprofits that work to build housing and reduce asthma and hunger. An Intersect donation to the nonprofit Centro la Familia Advocacy Services was used to give away 250 high-efficiency window air-conditioning units to households close to the Darden site this summer.

The company also agreed to give money to Westside Elementary School, about four miles southeast of the site, to support campus upgrades and efforts to build more local housing.

Some donations have raised eyebrows. An undisclosed amount of the Intersect Power donations also will fund two years of after-school piano lessons from the Steinway Piano Gallery of Fresno at Cantua Elementary School.

In an email to The Times, Felipe Piedra, superintendent of the Golden Plains Unified School District, which includes Cantua Elementary, said 98% of the school’s roughly 185 students qualify for free or reduced lunch and “are in need of additional support and resources.” He said “water and clean energy are a big priority” but did not answer questions about why funds were going toward piano lessons.

Intersect Power is donating an undisclosed amount to the nonprofit Tree Fresno, which plants shade trees to reduce the effects of extreme heat and air pollution.

Sandoval, a former member of the Kerman City Council and longtime teacher in nearby Tranquility, scoffed at the piano lessons and tree donation, noting that Cantua Elementary is across the street from an orchard. He said he was frustrated to see Intersect Power working primarily with Fresno-based nonprofits.

“This thing is dictated from the top,” he said. “How is the money going to filter down to the community? Property taxes? That’s going to the county. How can we get some of those benefits?”

In an email to The Times, Tree Fresno’s chief executive, Mona Cummings, said her organization was assessing the need for plantings at the elementary schools in Cantua Creek and Five Points and seeking more input from locals.

During a public meeting in Coalinga this April, Leticia Villegas, a farmworker from Five Points, told the Energy Commission that she lives three miles from where the Darden solar panels will be built. She said through a Spanish interpreter that she works in fields during the day, when the sun is baking, and comes back to a run-down home with no air conditioning.

She said she hopes money from the development will “go directly to our community.”

“Please,” she added, “we want to be listened to.”

Felipe Perez, a City Council member in nearby Firebaugh and a former fieldworker, said he used to pick crops near the Darden site. He said it was not easy seeing new industries arrive, “using soil that we used to use for ag.”

Perez, 56, who came to the U.S. from Sinaloa, Mexico, in 1988, said there are not as many field jobs as there once were, in part because of drought and out-of-town farmers selling their land.

“The question is, are they going to hire us?” he said of clean energy developers. “In what language are they going to teach us? And what are we going to do when they don’t help us and we still get those kind of bills?”

Construction on the Darden project is expected to begin by the end of this year, and it should be fully operational in late 2027 or early 2028, Knowles said.

It will be built on 9,500 acres sold by the Westlands Water District, the nation’s largest agricultural water district. Decades of farming and irrigation have degraded the soil, drawing salts and metals to the surface. That and the district’s uncertain water supplies have made the land impractical for farming, prompting Westlands to divert water to more productive land.

The Darden project — located near a major PG&E power line that can transmit electricity north or south — will include a 1,150-megawatt solar facility with approximately 3.1 million solar panels.

It also will have up to 1,150 megawatts of battery storage via 1,440 Tesla Megapack 2XL units — essentially shipping container-sized units filled with battery modules. Such battery systems store excess energy generated during the day and release it into the power grid during times of high demand, including evening hours.

But in western Fresno County, many residents have expressed concern about the lithium-ion batteries catching fire — a fear that intensified after a massive blaze in January tore through a battery energy storage system in Moss Landing, a rural community in coastal Monterey County.

That fire, which burned more than 54,000 LG battery modules, spewed toxic smoke into the air and smoldered for several days. Firefighters let it burn, citing the dangers of dousing lithium-ion battery fires with water, which can cause dangerous chemical reactions. The risk of reignition has been so high that cleanup crews are just now beginning to remove the charred batteries.

Knowles said the Darden site will be safer because batteries will be in independent enclosures separated by open space outdoors, not stacked and placed in an enclosed building like they were in Moss Landing.

With proper engineering, lithium-ion battery storage sites pose little risk of catching fire, said Shirley Meng, a molecular engineering professor at the University of Chicago who is an expert on batteries and studies ethically sourced, recyclable materials for energy storage. Safety has improved dramatically in recent years, and the failure rate is about 1 in 10 million for all types of lithium-ion batteries, she said.

“Everybody has batteries in their hands,” Meng said, referencing smartphones. “Batteries are safe. The chemistry that’s in those [large-scale] facilities is even safer than the ones that you hold in your phone.”

In western Fresno County, residents have “been very vocal” about the Darden project being built in a place where emergency response times are already long, said Ryan Michaels, assistant chief of operations for the Fresno County Fire Protection District, which provides emergency services for the area.

There is no fire station in the nearest communities of Cantua Creek, Five Points and Three Rocks. Response time is typically more than 20 minutes, and “we want to make sure that as solar grows we don’t reduce our current level of services within those communities,” Michaels said.

Several large solar farms already have been built and are planned, and “it really hit us by surprise how many were coming to western Fresno County,” he added.

In recent months, Michaels said, firefighters have responded to numerous malfunctioning alarms and inverter fires at solar farms, he said. One recent blaze was sparked by vandals trying to steal wiring.

Intersect Power and the Fresno County Fire Protection District said they are still negotiating fire mitigation measures. A state-required emergency action plan has not yet been finalized.

Stacey Shepard, a spokesperson for the California Energy Commission, said Darden, like all such projects, must meet strict safety standards. When batteries are being shipped from the factory to the project site, they can only be charged up to 30%, and the developer has to provide at least two gates into the battery storage facility wide enough for emergency access. On site, she noted, the batteries will be surrounded by thermal detection cameras.

Even so, the fire protection district said it will need to build four new stations and hire additional staff as more large clean energy projects are built.

Michaels said Darden and other projects have to be planned for the long term. If it is going to be operating for up to 35 years, he said, “we need to be ready to fight fire there — and provide for their workers — for decades.”",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/39dfddc/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5472x2873+0+388/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fae%2F59%2Ff4c60ebb42eab5aef8d2ae3f4b89%2F1516848-me-proposed-battery-solar-storage-15.jpg,N,,2025-08-25 07:01:42.323414

Nishtar said that the launch of Zambia’s solar electrification project, “bringing clean energy to 250 health facilities and reaching 1.3 million people, alongside the DRIVE initiative in 41 districts, is a turning point for health equity.”

“These efforts will light up maternity wards, keep vaccines safe, and deliver care to the hardest-to-reach communities. They will also create over 200 jobs, showing how smart health investments can uplift lives and livelihoods. Zambia is showing what leadership looks like.”

With a commitment of approximately $28 million in funding, the HFSE initiative is designed to deploy 5 to 8kWp solar PV systems and cold chain equipment (CCE) in 1,277 health facilities across four countries: Zambia, Ethiopia, Pakistan and Uganda.

Solar-powered cold chain equipment rollout

UNICEF said Gavi has contributed significantly to the rollout of solar-powered cold chain equipment through the Cold Chain Equipment Optimisation Platform (CCEOP).

“However, fridges alone aren’t enough. This pilot tests whether that model can be scaled to fully solarise health facilities by powering lights, equipment and digital tools. If successful, it could unlock co-investment and long-term government support for maintenance, ensuring sustainability,” said UNICEF.

In Zambia, 250 healthcare facilities in 95 districts will be electrified under the HFSE project, prioritising off-grid facilities that provide maternity services and serve remote communities.

“This will ensure safe storage of vaccines and medicines, enable critical diagnostic and medical equipment, improve working conditions for health professionals and strengthen resilience and equity in primary health care services,” said UNICEF.

UNICEF said the GAVI project covering the four countries is slated to be completed by June 2026.

“Once the project is complete, an estimated 25 million people living in the catchment areas of the newly solarised health facilities will benefit from an increased range of services such as expanded access to immunisation services and availability of clean water. This includes 1.3 million people in Zambia.”

Zambia’s immunisation drive

“Today, more than 90% of children receive the full set of DTP 3 vaccines. But challenges remain. Some districts still lag behind, and the way vaccines and supplies are distributed within the country is one of the weakest parts of the system. This often leads to shortages or near shortages in many health facilities,” said UNICEF.

The Direct Delivery of Routine Immunisation Vaccines and other Essential health commodities for Equity (DRIVE) Initiative is a new and innovative approach to improving vaccine delivery in Zambia.

It works like a social enterprise, involving community volunteers, young people and others at the local level to help deliver vaccines and health supplies directly to clinics and outreach sites.

UNICEF said these delivery partners will work up to 10 days a month transporting vaccines.

And for the rest of the month they can use the same transport to earn income through other activities, helping them support themselves and maintain the vehicles.

Securing the cold chain supply

DRIVE is starting in 41 districts, creating 200 jobs. This will ensure vaccines and essential health supplies reach every clinic reliably and on time and also help health worker get to outreach sites without delays.

“The two initiatives we are launching today work hand in hand to strengthen our health system. By bringing vaccines and supplies directly to health centres and providing clean, reliable energy, we are making healthcare more accessible and consistent.

“These efforts support health workers, create jobs, build community ownership, and help us adapt to climate challenges,” said Bilal.

Both HFSE and DRIVE directly support Zambia’s progress towards the Immunisation Agenda 2030 and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), ensuring no child or community is left behind in the journey towards universal health coverage, said UNICEF.",https://www.esi-africa.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/AAA-zambia-solar-healthcare.jpg,N,,2025-08-25 07:01:45.783908

The National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Program (NEVI) allocated $88 million to Tennessee over five years to fund EV charger installation along major interstates and Hwy.
Those contracts would complement the state’s own EV charging infrastructure grant program, part of an overall push to support EV adoption.
Less than 400 charging ports funded under NEVI are complete and open for use, according to a dashboard maintained by EV States Clearinghouse.
This round will prioritize charging locations in areas that the department anticipates will not be served by the NEVI program.","A Tennessee department head is hopeful that new guidance for a federal program supporting the growth of electric vehicle charging networks may ultimately allow the state to proceed with $21 million in contracts that have been frozen since February.

The National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Program (NEVI) allocated $88 million to Tennessee over five years to fund EV charger installation along major interstates and Hwy. 64, which runs from Memphis to Pelham roughly along Tennessee’s southern border. The Tennessee Department of Transportation (TDOT) awarded $21 million of the funding to 10 applicants in January 2024 to install 30 new charging locations, each with ports to charge several vehicles, but the contracts were not executed before the federal program’s pause.

Those contracts would complement the state’s own EV charging infrastructure grant program, part of an overall push to support EV adoption. Tennessee’s EV manufacturing industry has grown over the last several years – often supported by state incentives to bring hundreds of jobs to rural communities – giving the state an economic interest in the vehicles’ success. Ford’s new BlueOval City facility in rural West Tennessee recently delayed mass production of its full-size electric truck until 2028 as the company refocuses on the production of cheaper, smaller models in Kentucky.

The $5 billion NEVI program has officially been on ice since February 2025, when the U.S. Federal Highway Administration officially suspended funding to comply with President Donald Trump’s executive order to pause federal grants supporting electric vehicles and clean energy.

Multiple states have challenged the Trump administration’s ability to freeze the funds in federal court. Tennessee is not among them.

U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean P. Duffy recently released interim guidance for the program intending to “streamline applications, provide states with more flexibility, and slash red tape,” according to the federal transportation department.

States can reapply for funding under the new requirements over the next 30 days.

Tennessee program makes progress on EV chargers while frozen federal projects languish

Tennessee Department of Transportation Director Beth Emmons said the department is reviewing the new guidance and updated requirements and “hopes to have a path forward with this program by the time the guidelines become official.”

The program’s deployment has been slow. Less than 400 charging ports funded under NEVI are complete and open for use, according to a dashboard maintained by EV States Clearinghouse. The federal government allocated $3.3 billion to states for fiscal years 2022 through 2025. Of the 38 states that have issued awards under previously approved plans (which must now be resubmitted), 16 states have at least one operational station. States have awarded a total $544 million.

The revised guidance went into effect on Aug. 13, and the Federal Highway Administration is accepting comments on the rule changes through Aug. 27.

“If Congress is requiring the federal government to support charging stations, let’s cut the waste and do it right,” Duffy said in a statement released Aug. 11. “The Biden-Buttigieg Administration failed to deliver EV chargers despite their promises … While I don’t agree with subsidizing green energy, we will respect Congress’ will and make sure this program uses federal resources efficiently.”

Changes include scrapping language regarding serving “rural, underserved, and disadvantaged communities,” “equitable distribution,” and opportunities for minority- and women-owned small businesses. The guidance also removes requirements for states to “address consumer protections, emergency evacuation plans, environmental siting, resilience and terrain considerations.”

Charging industry coalition welcomes changes, nonprofit says new requirements are another stall tactic

Charge Ahead Partnership, a coalition supporting a nationwide EV charging network, welcomed the new guidance.

Slow uptake by states in NEVI’s first three years was due to “requirements within the original guidance that slowed down deployment,” according to a coalition statement released Aug. 13.

“The ultimate goal of the NEVI program is to expand the nation’s EV charging infrastructure, and these updated guidelines will make that outcome more likely,” Charge Ahead Partnership Executive Director Jay Smith said. “A streamlined NEVI program will make it easier for the mom-and-pop gas station on the corner, along with national retail chains, to offer EV charging.”

The coalition is particularly optimistic about guidance encouraging states to prioritize applicants who will serve as the site host and charging provider, a move they say will cut down on time that would otherwise be spent searching for a site, and allow for simpler accountability.

The Sierra Club, one of several nonprofit groups that have joined legal challenges against the funding freeze, contends that the new guidance is “unnecessary” and serves only to further delay EV charging buildout as states reapply for funds.

“It’s ironic that this guidance was sold as cutting red tape, yet all it has accomplished is more than half a year of needless delay,” Sierra Club Clean Transportation for All Director Katherine Garcia stated in a news release.

“While the Trump administration has moved away from anti-EV rhetoric in this guidance in response to federal litigation filed by over a dozen states, Sierra Club, and other nonprofit organizations, it is still illegally withholding billions Congress dedicated to EV charging.”

Separate state program continues charger rollout

In the meantime, Tennessee’s separately funded Fast Charge TN program has supported EV charger installation in a 400-mile loop connecting Nashville, Knoxville, Cookeville and Chattanooga.

The state program is powered by money from the Volkswagen Diesel Settlement Environmental Mitigation Trust, electricity revenues from TVA and cost share from grant recipients. It aims to position an EV charger every 50 miles along Tennessee interstates and highways.

Under Fast Charge TN’s first round, 35 charging sites are operational and 18 more are under development.

The Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation, which oversees the Fast Charge TN program, announced on Friday that it will extend its application period for the second round of funding through Sept. 19 at 4 p.m.

This round will prioritize charging locations in areas that the department anticipates will not be served by the NEVI program.",https://tennesseelookout.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Charging-Station001-2048x1367.jpg,N,,2025-08-25 07:02:01.950674

""Their technical excellence and proven delivery give us confidence in achieving regulatory clearance and advancing our deployment strategy efficiently and safely.""

Under the terms of the agreement, the partners will complete the COLA documentation that was submitted by Fermi America to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) on June 17, 2025. In addition, they will support the review process for approval and work together to develop a long-term strategy for the site.

""As the only fully licensed, construction-ready advanced modular reactor available today, the AP1000 technology is ready to deliver the power needed to unlock the full potential of next-generation artificial intelligence,"" added Dan Lipman, president, Energy Systems, Westinghouse. ""We look forward to a productive partnership with Fermi America to bring these AP1000 units online at the pace needed to solidify America's energy dominance.""

The AP1000 is an advanced Generation III+ Pressurized Water Reactor (PWR). Each reactor has a net electrical output of approximately 1,100MWe to 1,117MWe. According to Westinghouse, it uses a simplified, two-loop PWR design with passive safety systems to enhance safety and efficiency. At present, there are six AP1000s in operation, with a further 14 under construction, and five more under contract.

The last set of AP1000 units installed in the US was at the Vogtle nuclear plant in 2023, coming in $17 billion over budget and more than seven years behind schedule.

The HyperGrid AI campus was announced back in June and will reportedly include “18 million sq ft (1.67 million sqm) of data centers and generate up to 11GW of IT capacity from natural gas, solar, wind, and clean nuclear energy.”

In July, the company acquired more than 600MW of natural gas generation across two deals. Following this, the company signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Hyundai to deliver nuclear power to the project.

Fermi was co-founded by former US Energy Secretary and Texas governor Rick Perry. The company said geotechnical work has already begun on the campus and is expected to deliver 1GW of power by the end of 2026.

To examine the effects on greenhouse gases (GHGs) and criteria air pollutants (CAPs) from using these feedstocks to produce ethanol or electricity, we conducted a comprehensive life cycle assessment (LCA) and estimated the impact on human health costs when land use is changed from corn production for ethanol. Results indicate up to 54% reduced GHG per hectare from using willow and switchgrass feedstock sources to produce ethanol instead of corn. However, there was a trade-off in terms of CAP emission, as grass-based energy emitted more NOx and SOx compared to the corn ethanol pathway, except for SOX emissions from willow-based electricity. Electricity from cellulosic biomass had higher particulate matter (PM) emission compared to that from corn ethanol. Estimates for health cost to society ranged from $2498 ha–1 for electricity from switchgrass to a net benefit of $448 ha–1 for ethanol production from willow, depending on varying biomass yield under different market scenarios.

With rapid advances in technology and our understanding of Colorado’s renewable energy capacity, achieving a 100% renewable energy grid for Colorado is not a far-fetched goal.
Studies have shown the feasibility of a 100% renewable energy grid for Los Angeles, the U.S. and many other cities and countries around the world.
Finally, a timely transition to 100% renewable energy will help us avoid the worst climate-influenced disasters and their ever-mounting costs, such as the devastating Marshall Fire several years ago.
We know that a transition to 100% renewable, nuclear-free energy is possible, so let’s advocate for it.","Xcel Energy’s recent decision to close its coal power plants across the state by 2030 puts Colorado at an important crossroads. The closing of these power plants, most notably Comanche 3 in Pueblo, presents an opportunity to transition our state to cleaner energy.

However, Xcel is proposing to replace the electric power from their coal plants in part with new gas-fired plants and are contemplating nuclear energy, all detailed in Xcel’s Just Transition Plan. But, the plan needs approval from the Public Utilities Commission to move forward. This is the perfect moment to tell the PUC we need a clean-energy future instead of one stuck with expensive, dysfunctional and polluting power plants for decades to come.

Doing so will ensure our state’s long-term health and financial well-being, and it will prevent the worst effects of climate change.

Under Colorado law, Xcel’s plan must result in an 80% reduction in carbon dioxide emissions from 2005 levels by 2030, and nuclear energy may be used on the way to achieving Colorado’s commitment to 100% clean energy by 2050. However, nuclear energy carries great administrative and environmental risk, and Xcel already operates over 20 natural gas plants in the state. Xcel deserves credit for expanding the use of renewable energy in their plan, but the best time to plan for 100% renewable, nuclear-free energy is now.

With rapid advances in technology and our understanding of Colorado’s renewable energy capacity, achieving a 100% renewable energy grid for Colorado is not a far-fetched goal. Modeling by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory shows that Colorado has the wind and solar potential to meet our current demand many times over. And wind and solar technology continues to improve, increasing in efficiency by 30% to 40% in the last 15 years alone. Geothermal energy is also on the horizon for Colorado. The Western Governors’ Geothermal Task Force estimates Colorado can produce significant geothermal power within a decade, and Geothermal Technologies Inc. estimates it could produce 400 megawatts of power from several known sites.

A common concern with a 100% renewable grid is the daily and seasonal variability of wind and solar generation. However, renewables can meet demand 24/7, every day of the year by ramping up storage capacity combined with more constant sources like geothermal. The storage capacity of batteries continues to dramatically improve, enabling renewable energy grids to smooth out variability and release surplus power when it’s needed most. Studies have shown the feasibility of a 100% renewable energy grid for Los Angeles, the U.S. and many other cities and countries around the world. In fact, seven countries have nearly reached 100% renewable grids already.

Moving to 100% renewable energy is not only possible for Colorado, but is the best path for our health and environment. Pollution from gas-fired power plants poses serious risks to the health of those living nearby, including from nitrogen oxides and other airborne toxins that can cause cancer and cardiovascular disease. Colorado, and the Front Range in particular, also suffers from poor air quality due to high levels of ozone. Unfortunately, a warming climate is only making our ozone problems more severe and frequent.

Renewable energy is also the smart choice for Colorado’s economy. Numerous studies have shown that the development of wind and solar brings new jobs, especially if Colorado encourages more rooftop solar. The financial value of the public health benefits of using clean, renewable energy sources would also be sizable. Estimates for public health savings in Los Angeles, assuming a move toward 100% renewables, come in at $1.5 billion for a single year. Applied to Colorado’s population, that would be over $2 billion in savings per year. Finally, a timely transition to 100% renewable energy will help us avoid the worst climate-influenced disasters and their ever-mounting costs, such as the devastating Marshall Fire several years ago.

If we want to achieve this future of economic, health, and environmental benefits, there is no place for Xcel to build additional gas-fired plants or chase risky solutions like nuclear energy. We know that a transition to 100% renewable, nuclear-free energy is possible, so let’s advocate for it. We owe it to ourselves and the next generation of Coloradans to do so.

SAN FRANCISCO, CA, UNITED STATES, August 24, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- Energy America (EA), a USA-based solar module manufacturer and EPC contractor, together with Centauri, its advanced R&D arm, today announced their official entry into the Saudi Arabian renewable energy market. The companies have been granted an investment license from the Kingdom’s Ministry of Investment (MISA), enabling them to operate as a local entity and partner directly with Saudi stakeholders under the framework of Vision 2030.

This milestone unlocks Energy America’s ability to develop utility-scale solar photovoltaic (PV) power plants with integrated Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS), modernize Transmission & Distribution (T&D) networks, and explore the establishment of local solar module manufacturing facilities. These initiatives will strengthen Saudi Arabia’s renewable capacity while building local supply chains, creating jobs, and ensuring technology transfer to Saudi citizens.

U.S. Technology and Financing: A Strategic Advantage for Saudi Arabia

Energy America’s market entry reflects the growing demand for transparent, compliant, and secure renewable energy supply chains. Recent developments in U.S. policy — including the Trump Administration’s Section 232 investigation on polysilicon and FEOC (Foreign Entity of Concern) restrictions — are reshaping global solar supply, reinforcing the importance of American technology in international partnerships.

For Saudi Arabia, this means access to:

EXIM Bank financing support for large-scale solar and storage projects, providing long-term bankability and sovereign-level risk mitigation.

U.S. regulatory alignment, ensuring solar assets deployed in the Kingdom are free from trade-disruption risks and fully compliant with future global regulatory frameworks.

American-engineered solar modules, designed for reliability in extreme climates and developed with the highest standards of traceability, performance, and durability.

“Saudi Arabia’s bold renewable energy targets and pro-business environment under Vision 2030 make it an ideal place for our growth,” said Jack Stone, Chief Executive Officer of Energy America. “By bringing American technology, FEOC-compliant supply chains, and EXIM-backed financing into the Kingdom, we are ensuring that Saudi projects will not only succeed technically but remain secure from shifting trade and regulatory risks. This is the foundation for a durable U.S.–Saudi partnership in clean energy.”

Saudi Market Entry and Local Partnerships

With the Riyadh investment license secured, Energy America and Centauri will establish a regional headquarters in the coming weeks. The companies plan to collaborate closely with Saudi ministries, utilities, private developers, and supply chain partners to deliver:

Utility-scale solar PV and BESS projects supporting grid stability and round-the-clock clean energy.

Transmission & Distribution modernization, aligned with Saudi Arabia’s expanding electricity demand.

Local module manufacturing feasibility studies, designed to maximize domestic content and create a long-term, U.S.-aligned industrial base.

“Saudi Arabia’s strategic role in the Middle East’s energy transition cannot be overstated,” said Kevin Lumbert, Vice President for Saudi Arabia. “By establishing a permanent presence here, we will directly contribute to Vision 2030 — from solar farms and storage systems to advanced T&D infrastructure. More importantly, we are committed to engaging with local suppliers and training Saudi talent so that this transition creates sustainable jobs and knowledge transfer. With American technology and financing behind us, our projects will deliver lasting value for both Saudi Arabia and the wider region.”

Strengthening Vision 2030 Goals

Energy America’s expansion into Saudi Arabia is structured to:

Support 50% renewable energy generation targets by 2030.

Establish bankable projects financed under EXIM Bank programs, reducing reliance on non-compliant imports.

Create local employment opportunities in engineering, manufacturing, and project execution.

Thus the idea of an “energy transition” as a solution to the “energy crisis” entered the realm of public discussion, all oriented around the need to find a more reliable and abundant source of energy that couldn’t be choked off by OPEC.","In universities, labs, corporate research departments, think tanks, and intergovernmental organizations, thousands of smart, qualified experts are working away (or at least those who still have funding are working away), devoting billions of dollars and millions of hours to a problem they collectively refer to as “the energy transition.” The idea is simple: Human society once ran exclusively on photosynthetic sources of energy such as wood and animal power; then the Industrial Revolution brought about a transition to fossil fuel energy in the form of coal, which was later replaced by oil. The fossil fuel economy has become untenable on a planetary scale, so we must now bring about another transition, to renewable energy, through a huge project of innovation (facilitated by a heretofore unseen level of collaboration between the public and private sectors). The transitions of the past, the experts say, should provide helpful examples for how we can pull off such a feat. This monumental effort, we are told, is our best hope for surviving climate change. But according to the French historian of science Jean-Baptiste Fressoz, the battle is already lost. We are in a lot of trouble.

In More and More and More: An All-Consuming History of Energy, Fressoz sets out to show that there is no such thing as an “energy transition,” and there never has been. To put it bluntly: “After two centuries of ‘energy transitions,’ humanity has never burned so much oil and gas, so much coal and so much wood. Today around 2 billion cubic metres of wood are felled each year to be burned, three times more than a century ago.” Instead, Fressoz’s coruscating history looks to explain “why all primary energies have grown together and why they have accumulated without replacing each other.” Far from being an established empirical fact about the past, the “energy transition” began as “a heterodox and mercantile futurology—a mere industrial slogan—which, from the 1970s onwards, became the future of experts, governments and companies, including those that had no interest whatsoever in seeing it happen.”

The book splits cleanly into two halves. The first relentlessly piles up factual evidence to show that coal did not replace wood and oil did not replace coal. Rather, the production of each has entailed an intensification in the use of the others, such that the global history of energy can be seen as one of constant accumulation and the continued persistence of older techniques, not one of epochal technological transitions. The second half of the book traces the emergence and rise to intellectual dominance of the concept of “energy transition” itself. In this way, More and More and More is both a material history and an intellectual one, or as Fressoz puts it, “the politics of history in the face of climate change.”

Fressoz is a widely published historian of science who, along with Christophe Bonneuil, wrote The Shock of the Anthropocene (2015), a field-defining book that both dissects the concept of the “Anthropocene” and provides the most concise and terrifying digest of the postwar “Great Acceleration” in climatic destruction yet written. If one person is going to shout in public that the emperor is naked, Fressoz is among the most persuasive candidates.

Much of More and More and More makes for devastating reading. By considering the entirety of a production chain instead of just its output or its main source of power, Fressoz reveals that all of our economic systems are mutually dependent, and have been for centuries. The growth of the coal industry in the 19th century, for instance, depended on an immense amount of timber to prop up the mines and to transport the coal in ships and carts. With the introduction of chain saws in the 20th century, wood production became oil-intensive, such that “2 to 3 litres of diesel are consumed per cubic metre of wood extracted, meaning that wood has become, in part, a fossil fuel.” Forestry productivity has increased to keep up with demand, but it has done so through the use of chemical fertilizers that are oil-intensive to produce. And oil never really replaced coal: Cars drive on roads made of concrete, which is produced with coal, to the degree that about half a ton of coal is burned for every meter of concrete road. The first oil rigs were made of wood, as were the barrels that oil was transported in. Strip-mining for coal runs on oil-intensive machines, so even in surface mines it takes “between 1 and 2.5 litres of diesel to extract one tonne of coal.” And so on.

Even if it were possible to decarbonize electricity production (and recent work by Brett Christophers persuasively argues that it is not, at least not within market institutions), that still would not decarbonize the production of cement, steel, plastic, and fertilizers, which together account for a quarter of global emissions, and much of which would be used intensively in the production of whatever systems of solar and wind power would be needed for shifting the global electricity grid from fossil fuels to renewables.

If Fressoz is right—and he certainly is very convincing—how is it possible that so many intelligent people are spending so much money working on so many projects around the world to chase an impossible illusion?

When and where did the idea of an energy transition emerge? Fressoz argues that it originated in the Great Depression. Many scientists and engineers, inspired by the late work of Thorstein Veblen and a belief in the rational management of society, feared that the global economic downturn was the outcome of an energy transition gone wrong: The previous decades of industrial growth (in America especially) had generated a huge amount of output by marshaling an even larger amount of energy. That replacement of human power by electrical power was thought to be the cause of mass unemployment, even in the face of overproduction and overcapacity. Electricity had been the source of rapid growth, but it suddenly seemed to be the source of a structural crisis as well. This was understood to be a new puzzle requiring scientific management to solve. The members of this “technocracy movement” of the 1930s produced new kinds of statistical tools, especially the S-curve, which shows first exponential growth and then diminishing returns, thereby illustrating how apparently rapid growth is unsustainable. A group of scientists and engineers called the Technical Alliance used these curves in an unfinished report on energy usage in the United States, aiming to show that the unregulated capitalist system was wasteful.

The technocracy movement did not survive the interwar period: Some of its members embraced Herbert Hoover, who called himself America’s “chief engineer,” while others enthusiastically supported the New Deal’s expansion of technical management and regulation. The movement’s eccentric leader, Howard Scott, liked isolationism and quasi-military parades, which grew unattractive in the early 1940s. Yet, while the movement’s interpretation of the Depression did not last, its statistical tools did. In the postwar era, boosters of atomic energy used S-curves to show the inevitable decline of oil production, thereby creating the idea of “peak oil.” The same curves were used to illustrate future predictions for all sorts of things, from economic and population growth to person-hours per unit of production and industrial employment. These predictions were then marshaled for political advocacy. Across an increasing range of social and economic indicators, the “atomic Malthusians” (to use Fressoz’s delightful phrase) envisioned a future of finitude, one rife with population catastrophes, food and energy shortages, and economic decline that could only be prevented by a transition to nuclear energy. The term “energy transition” itself was coined by the former Manhattan Project nuclear chemist Harrison Brown in 1967, at a conference of neo-Malthusians discussing food and family planning.

The transition concept was embraced in nuclear policy advocacy, but it remained limited in its application until it intersected with another newly transformed idea. In the 1970s, the concept of an “energy crisis” (a sharper version of “energy transition”) was transformed from an ecological critique of too much energy to a policy critique of too little energy in the moment of oil price shocks, gasoline rationing, and the image of Jimmy Carter’s solar panels on the White House. Thus the idea of an “energy transition” as a solution to the “energy crisis” entered the realm of public discussion, all oriented around the need to find a more reliable and abundant source of energy that couldn’t be choked off by OPEC. And finally, after the 1970s, a number of free-market economists (among them Nobel laureate William Nordhaus) and fossil fuel companies like Exxon began using statistical projections of the future to argue that innovation and technology would inevitably find solutions to the possibility of climate disaster, thus obviating the need for any urgent action, let alone regulation. Emissions and fossil fuel use, they claimed, would also follow a reassuring S-curve pattern, and new technologies would benefit from the rapid upward slope of the first part of the curve while old ones tapered off. “The alignment of these inherently polluting industries under the banner of energy transition has at least one merit,” Fressoz writes: “It clarifies the ideological function of this notion. Energy transition has become the politically correct future for the industrial world.”

In this way, Fressoz means to show two things: first, that the idea of “energy transition” was long a fringe belief associated with Depression-era industrial theorists, radical environmentalists, and atomic Malthusians, all people whom respectable mainstream scientific opinion would probably disavow today. And second, that the conceptual and empirical toolbox of S-curves, future discounting, and transition dynamics invented in one time and place has gone on to serve different purposes in others, especially regarding our ability to imagine the future. “Transition,” Fressoz writes, “projects a past that does not exist onto an elusive future.”

Ad Policy

Any discussion of capitalism, climate change, and the future must eventually invoke Fredric Jameson’s observation that it is easier to imagine the end of the world than to imagine the end of capitalism. Fressoz does so here, to chilling effect, in his discussion of Group III of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which is the working group on mitigation. They have adopted wholesale the innovation paradigm from the fossil fuel industry to imagine a preposterous future—of infinite growth made possible by marine cloud seeding and space mirrors, all purely hypothetical—thereby foreclosing the possibility of changes to the institutions of capitalism. Fressoz heaps scorn on their hectic ideas, such as burning fast-growing trees in an amount greater than the world’s total wood production, then burying the carbon in the ground indefinitely. “Some experts within Group III of the IPCC,” he writes, “will have entertained visions of liquefied CO2 lakes resting on the ocean floor before considering the reduction of the size of any national economy.”

From this, Fressoz reaches a damning conclusion: “Transition is the ideology of capital in the twenty-first century,” and our faith in innovation and technology as a solution “is preventing us from having an adult conversation about climate change.”

This is strong stuff, and the stakes are perilously high. Some readers are likely to object to the way that Fressoz counts inputs and intermediary goods in production—but that is exactly his point. We have created conceptual tools—including measuring economies within national borders, not production chains—that do not allow us to see the actual materiality of any economic process from beginning to end. Others will object that Fressoz does not clearly set out what he thinks the missing “adult conversation” should look like, aside from several references to degrowth. At 320 pages, the book is brief enough that I do wish he had taken that point on explicitly, because his commitment to unsparing realism might have provided new insights into the common critique of degrowth: namely, that the world is profoundly unequal, so an end to growth will either create permanent inequality or depend on a politically implausible program of global redistribution. If that is the adult conversation, it needs to start.

It must also be said that this is a profoundly bleak book. The central hope for human survival held by most experts, technocrats, politicians, and the alarmed general public is not only a fiction, Fressoz insists, but an active impediment that has set back action by decades, to such a degree that it is now probably too late. All that work on mitigation has been dithering around the margins, mainly acting as cover and public relations for egregious polluters and emitters, at best producing some moderate process improvements that have immediately been offset by increases in total production or the geographical redistribution of the most obviously harmful activity to poorer countries.

Fressoz is adamant that there is no realistic possibility of carbon-free material abundance, and that the world is not thinkable without plastic, fertilizer, and cement, the building blocks of modern life, which cannot be decarbonized even under a transition to electricity from solar and wind. Perhaps, then, the adult conversation is about what a world of permanently declining material standards will look like. If so, it is difficult to feel confident that all those mitigating and innovating scientists, lawyers, policy wonks, and academics will pivot to working collectively on a program of global redistribution rather than continuing to do what they have done for decades, which is serve the interests of capital. Meanwhile, those opportunistic enough can make a quick buck on fantasies of energy transition, while any project of redistribution faces bigger and bigger obstacles, with less and less time and resources available.",https://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-1355969231.jpeg,N,,2025-08-25 05:59:18.975040

Overview of Geothermal Energy in the United States

Geothermal energy, derived from the natural heat stored beneath the Earth’s surface, has long been part of the United States’ diverse portfolio of renewable energy resources. This form of energy is reliable, sustainable, and capable of providing both electricity and direct heating. Unlike wind and solar, geothermal power is available 24/7, regardless of weather or daylight conditions, making it a valuable component in the transition toward a low-carbon energy future.

The United States stands among the world’s leading producers of geothermal energy. With significant geothermal resources, especially in the western states, the country has demonstrated steady growth in both electricity generation and direct-use applications. The unique geology of the United States—especially the presence of active tectonic features—has enabled the development of a robust geothermal industry.

Recent Developments in US Geothermal Energy

In recent years, the U.S. geothermal sector has experienced renewed momentum driven by advances in drilling technology, novel exploration techniques, supportive federal and state policies, and rising demand for clean energy. Below are some of the key developments shaping the industry:

Technological Innovation: The adoption of advanced drilling techniques, including enhanced geothermal systems (EGS), has expanded the potential for geothermal development in previously inaccessible areas. EGS involves engineering or stimulating deep rock formations to create or enhance pathways for heat extraction, enabling geothermal power production even where natural hydrothermal resources are scarce.

Federal Support and Policy: The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) has made significant investments in geothermal research and demonstration projects. Programs such as the Geothermal Technologies Office (GTO) fund innovations in subsurface science, drilling efficiency, and reservoir management. The DOE has also launched the FORGE (Frontier Observatory for Research in Geothermal Energy) initiative, which serves as a field laboratory to advance EGS research.

Grid Integration and Flexibility: As the share of intermittent renewables grows, the value of geothermal energy as a baseload resource with high capacity factors has become more apparent. Hybrid solutions combining geothermal with solar or energy storage technologies are also emerging.

Direct-Use Applications: Beyond power generation, geothermal heat is increasingly used for direct applications such as district heating, greenhouse agriculture, aquaculture, and industrial processes across various communities in the United States.

Decarbonization Efforts: Geothermal energy is central to several state and local decarbonization strategies, with California and Nevada leading efforts to integrate more geothermal power into their clean energy goals.

Key Geothermal Exploration Areas in the United States

The geological makeup of the western United States is particularly favorable for geothermal resource development. However, recent exploration and technological advances are broadening the map for potential geothermal activity.

California

California is the nation’s undisputed leader in geothermal electricity production, home to the famous Geysers field—the largest complex of geothermal power plants in the world. The Imperial Valley, including the Salton Sea Known Geothermal Resource Area (KGRA), is a hub for ongoing exploration and development. Here, geothermal brines are also rich in lithium, opening opportunities for critical mineral extraction alongside energy production.

Nevada

Nevada boasts the second-highest installed geothermal capacity in the country. The state’s Great Basin region, with its high heat flow and tectonic activity, has spawned numerous geothermal power plants and remains an epicenter for exploration. Projects near Reno, in the Steamboat Hills area, as well as the Stillwater and Dixie Valley facilities, exemplify the state’s geothermal promise.

Utah

Utah is home to the innovative Utah FORGE site, a world-class EGS research facility. The state also features commercial geothermal power plants such as the Blundell Plant near Milford. Utah’s geology offers significant potential for expanding both traditional and enhanced geothermal development.

Oregon & Idaho

Both Oregon and Idaho have operational geothermal power plants and a long history of direct-use geothermal, including district heating systems in cities like Boise, Idaho. Exploration efforts continue, especially in the Cascade Range and Snake River Plain.

Alaska and Hawaii

While not as extensively developed, Alaska and Hawaii possess significant geothermal potential due to their volcanic activity. The Puna Geothermal Venture on Hawaii’s Big Island is a notable example of a successful geothermal power operation.

Emerging Regions

The expansion of EGS technology is opening new geothermal exploration frontiers in states once considered marginal for geothermal development, such as Colorado, New Mexico, Texas, and the Appalachian region. These advances could bring geothermal benefits to a broader swath of the country.

Leading Geothermal Companies in the United States

Several companies are central to the development, operation, and innovation of geothermal energy projects in the United States. These industry leaders range from large multinational energy firms to specialized geothermal operators and pioneering start-ups.

Ormat Technologies Inc.: Headquartered in Reno, Nevada, Ormat is the largest owner and operator of geothermal power plants in the U.S. The company is known for both geothermal and recovered energy generation projects. Ormat’s footprint spans California, Nevada, Hawaii, and global markets.

Calpine Corporation: Calpine operates The Geysers, the largest geothermal complex in the world, located in northern California. The company is a major supplier of baseload renewable power to the western U.S. grid.

Chevron Renewable Energy Group: While Chevron has long been a player in conventional energy, it has also invested in geothermal projects, including historic development at The Geysers and international ventures.

Cyrq Energy: This private geothermal developer focuses on renewable power production in states such as Utah and Nevada, operating several facilities and participating in cutting-edge projects.

Enel Green Power North America: Part of the multinational Enel Group, this company develops and operates geothermal facilities in the United States, including the Stillwater hybrid plant in Nevada, which combines geothermal, solar PV, and solar thermal generation.

S. Geothermal Inc.: Acquired by Ormat Technologies in 2018, U.S. Geothermal brought valuable project assets, especially in Idaho’s Raft River and Oregon’s Neal Hot Springs, to Ormat’s growing portfolio.

AltaRock Energy: A technology company specializing in EGS, AltaRock has been involved in demonstration projects in California, Oregon, and Nevada, pushing the boundaries of enhanced geothermal systems.

GreenFire Energy: Based in California, GreenFire develops closed-loop geothermal systems and is known for its innovative approaches to unlocking low-permeability resources.

Challenges and Opportunities

While the geothermal sector in the United States holds immense promise, it faces several challenges:

High Upfront Costs: Exploration and drilling for geothermal resources are capital-intensive, with significant risks due to subsurface uncertainties.

Regulatory Complexity: Development often requires navigating a patchwork of federal, state, and local regulations, especially when projects are sited on public lands.

Resource Identification: Mapping and characterizing geothermal resources accurately remains technologically challenging. Recent advances in geophysics and data science, however, are making significant inroads.

Public Awareness: Compared to wind and solar, geothermal remains less visible to the public and policymakers, resulting in less direct support and slower market growth.

Despite these obstacles, the opportunities for geothermal energy are expanding. The combination of reliable baseload power, minimal greenhouse gas emissions, and the potential to support grid stability makes geothermal a crucial asset for a decarbonized future. The extraction of critical minerals (such as lithium) from geothermal brines adds a further economic dimension, aligning with U.S. strategic supply chain goals.

The Path Forward

The future of geothermal energy in the United States is bright. Continuing technological innovation—especially the maturation of EGS and hybrid systems—coupled with robust policy support and public-private partnerships, is expected to unlock vast new resources. The geothermal industry is poised to play a foundational role in the nation’s clean energy transformation.

The United States is already a global leader in geothermal energy and stands at the threshold of a new era for this underappreciated resource. Through ongoing exploration, strategic investments, and the leadership of pioneering companies, geothermal energy will help power America’s transition to a sustainable and resilient energy future.

Each article highlights the repercussions of specific policies and budget reallocations.

Trump's recent bill opposes clean energy initiatives, affecting long-term prospects for Kansas City. The bill rescinds tax credits for solar panels and electric vehicles, potentially slowing down adoption and increasing energy costs for residents. The termination of credits impacts local manufacturing, as seen with Panasonic's battery plant, which delays its full production and employment targets. A study reveals Missouri utility bills will rise notably due to increased oil and gas leasing. This amplifies financial strain on households already struggling with utility payments.

The local radio station, KKFI, confronts a budget cut due to federal funding reduction for public broadcasting. This could limit programming and reduce community outreach, as it heavily relies on federal support for music licensing and emergency broadcasts. KKFI's potential limitations could mean fewer opportunities for emerging local artists and vital community information-sharing.

Heard of Earth Day? Get ready for Sun Day.

On Sept. 21, a Sunday of course, thousands of people will gather across the U.S. to spread the message that the clean energy revolution is here. By harnessing the sun — whose thermal energy also gives rise to wind — instead of burning fossil fuels, we can all enjoy cleaner air, lower utility bills, and a host of other benefits.

The day of action is the brainchild of climate journalist and activist Bill McKibben and is being spearheaded by nonprofit communications lab Fossil Free Media. They and a coalition of dozens of advocacy groups are bringing people together on Sun Day to celebrate the progress humanity has made in advancing and adopting renewable energy — and to push for a faster transition away from fossil fuels.

Helping Americans understand all that clean energy has to offer is more urgent than ever, as the Trump administration continues to target renewables, rapidly phasing out tax credits for solar and wind, halting offshore wind development, and maligning battery projects.

Meanwhile solar and wind power are booming globally. And even in the U.S., more than 90% of new power capacity installed last year came from solar, wind, and batteries. Everywhere, the cost of building renewable power is plummeting, making solar and wind the cheapest sources of new electricity.

“We still think of photovoltaic panels and wind turbines as ​‘alternative energy,’ as if they were the Whole Foods of power, nice but pricey. In fact — ­and more so with each passing month —­ they are the Costco of energy, inexpensive and available in bulk,” writes McKibben in his new book ​“Here Comes the Sun: A Last Chance for the Climate and a Fresh Chance for Civilization,” which shines a light on the growth of renewables.

“The general public just isn’t aware of how far clean energy has come,” said Jamie Henn, a longtime climate activist and now head of Fossil Free Media.

Individuals and groups have planned more than 150 community events around the country for Sun Day so far. In New York City, organizers are hosting a festival with informational booths, performances, and face-painting. Around Clemson, South Carolina, residents with homes powered by rooftop solar are throwing open their doors to public tours. In Moscow, Idaho, people will be able to test-drive their neighbors’ zero-emissions cars at an electric-vehicle fair.

​“It’s going to be a beautiful day,” said Antonique Smith, a Grammy-nominated singer and actress who cofounded the nonprofit Climate Revival and has assumed the role of Sun Day ambassador.

Inspired by Martin Luther King Jr.’s organizing in churches for the Civil Rights Movement, Smith visits houses of worship to explain that there’s an alternative to the fossil fuel plants that spew cancer-causing pollution disproportionately in disadvantaged neighborhoods.

“Clean energy and solar are so important, especially to communities of color and poor communities,” Smith told Canary Media. ​“How wonderful is it that we have this solution? … It’s not a luxury anymore.”

At climate events, Smith often sings a slowed-down version of The Beatles’ ​“Here Comes the Sun” to honor the power of activism and clean energy. Her rendition is also the anthem for the upcoming day of action, and she’ll be performing the song at Sun Day extravaganzas in Brooklyn and Times Square, she said.

Sun Day will also give people a chance to reflect on the risks of a rapidly warming world, according to the Rev. Fletcher Harper, executive director of GreenFaith, a global interfaith environmental coalition. GreenFaith is working with more than 30 partner groups, representing a couple hundred congregations, that are hosting Sun Day gatherings, including a climate-justice pilgrimage in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.

“When you look at the impacts of climate change — dangerous levels of heat, drought that forces small farmers around the world off of land that sustained their families for generations, fires that destroy people’s homes, and floods from severe storms — it’s the destruction of the environment that creates enormous human suffering,” Harper said. ​“It’s just wrong. … And the crime is that it’s preventable.”

The fossil fuel industry, having peddled its products while knowing the existential threat they pose, is a candidate for ​“one of Dante’s inner circles,” he noted wryly.

The moment for a clean energy movement

Sun Day’s organizers aim to spark a widespread popular movement whose influence is felt long after the day of action.

“People power is just this incredible way to unlock progress more quickly,” Henn said. ​“And that’s what we need to meet the kind of climate targets that we have in place.”

With all of its economic and societal advantages, clean energy might be inevitable, but ​“we can’t let this take 40 years,” he noted. ​“We need it to happen over the next five to 10 years, [which] will require a real mobilization.”

Solar and wind projects are increasingly hitting resistance at the local level.

“We’re just getting completely outplayed,” Henn said. The fossil fuel industry has ​“invested in front groups [and] field campaigns” to spread misinformation through Facebook and organize people against clean energy, he noted.

Sun Day will bring together people who can call on local leaders, regulators, and representatives to deliver clean energy now. Indeed, Fossil Free Media is already helping build those local grassroots networks, said Deirdre Shelly, who’s leading organizing efforts for the big day.

How to get involved in Sun Day

Want to participate but not sure where to jump in? Start by checking out Sun Day’s map to see if an event is already scheduled in your area. If you want to plan your own shindig, organizers have pulled together a toolkit to help you realize your vision, be it a solar-panel show-and-tell, an e-bike parade, or a clean energy rally turned block party. You can also tap one of the dozens of climate, justice, and grassroots groups that are core partners for the day of action, including 350.org, EcoMadres, Sierra Club, Solar United Neighbors, and Third Act, to see if they’re looking for Sun Day volunteers.

Conclusion: A Resilient Cornerstone of the S&P 500 The S&P 500's rally is not just a tech-driven story.","The S&P 500's recent rally has been fueled by a mix of speculative fervor and fundamentals-driven growth, but one sector stands out as a structural winner: energy infrastructure. While the broader Energy sector has stumbled in Q2 2025 amid collapsing oil prices and regulatory headwinds, energy infrastructure—encompassing grid modernization, renewable energy, and storage—has emerged as a resilient outperformer. This divergence is not accidental. It reflects a profound shift in the U.S. economy, driven by surging electricity demand, policy tailwinds, and the urgent need to modernize aging systems. For investors, the case for energy infrastructure is no longer speculative—it is a calculated bet on the future of energy.

Structural Shifts: From Fossil Fuels to Electrification

The U.S. energy landscape is undergoing a tectonic transformation. By 2025, the electric power sector's capital investment has hit a record $179 billion, with projections of $1.4 trillion in cumulative spending from 2025 to 2030. This surge is driven by three forces:

1. Electrification of the economy: Electric vehicles (EVs), heat pumps, and industrial processes are accelerating demand. Data centers alone are expected to require 35 GW of electricity by 2030, up from 17 GW in 2022.

2. Renewable energy expansion: Solar and wind capacity additions are outpacing fossil fuels. Solar is projected to account for 58% of new energy capacity in 2024, while battery storage capacity has grown from 6% of total storage in 2018 to 48% today.

3. Grid modernization: Aging infrastructure, climate risks, and the need for distributed energy resources (DERs) are pushing utilities to invest in smart grids, cybersecurity, and non-wire alternatives.

Policy Tailwinds: The Inflation Reduction Act and Beyond

The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) have created a policy superhighway for energy infrastructure. The IIJA allocated $73 billion for grid modernization, while the IRA's tax credits for renewables and storage have unlocked $450 billion in private investment in semiconductors and EV manufacturing. These policies are not just theoretical—they are reshaping the sector's economics.

For example, the IRA's 30% tax credit for pumped storage hydropower (PSH) has reignited interest in this long-neglected technology. Similarly, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act's shortened deadlines for clean energy tax credits (projects must come online by 2027) has created a “race to build,” accelerating project timelines and boosting near-term earnings for infrastructure developers.

The Trump administration's deregulatory agenda has further amplified these tailwinds. Streamlined permitting and tax cuts have enabled small-cap energy and industrial firms to expand margins, while the focus on energy independence has spurred domestic production of critical minerals and components.

Earnings Resilience: A Sector in Transition

While the S&P 500 Energy sector has posted a -24% year-over-year earnings drop in Q2 2025, energy infrastructure has bucked the trend. The Oil & Gas Storage & Transportation sub-industry, for instance, saw a 14% earnings increase, driven by LNG exports and pipeline maintenance. Meanwhile, utilities and renewable energy firms have delivered consistent returns, with the U.S. utilities sector up 34.6% since January 2024.

Looking ahead, the sector's earnings trajectory is poised to outperform. Analysts project 10.2% earnings growth in Q1 2026 and 29.8% in Q2 2026, as OPEC's potential return to the market stabilizes oil prices and LNG demand surges. For infrastructure, the numbers are even more compelling: energy infrastructure ETFs trade at a 15% discount to global equities on a forward P/E basis, suggesting significant upside as demand for electricity continues to rise.

Investment Implications: Balancing Growth and Stability

For investors, the key is to pair high-growth energy infrastructure plays with defensive assets. Jefferies recommends overweighting energy infrastructure ETFs and pairing them with high-margin tech firms to balance the risks of AI-driven electricity demand surges. Specific opportunities include:

- Grid modernization firms: Companies like Brookfield Renewable Partners and Stonepeak Infrastructure Partners are leading joint ventures in offshore wind and solar.

- Battery storage developers: Firms with utility-scale projects, such as Intersect Power (partnering with Google and TPG), are positioned to capitalize on the IRA's incentives.

- Private capital partnerships: Utilities like Duke Energy and Dominion Energy are leveraging private equity to fund renewable projects, reducing debt burdens and accelerating ROI.

However, risks remain. Rising interest rates have increased utility debt costs, with 14% of 2025 capital investment now sourced from equity. Regulatory lag in authorizing returns on equity also poses a challenge. Investors must monitor interconnection delays and credit ratings for utilities, as some face downgrades due to strained balance sheets.

Conclusion: A Resilient Cornerstone of the S&P 500

The S&P 500's rally is not just a tech-driven story. Energy infrastructure is emerging as a critical pillar of this bull market, driven by structural demand, policy tailwinds, and earnings resilience. While the broader Energy sector faces headwinds, infrastructure-focused plays are well-positioned to outperform. For investors seeking long-term growth in a volatile market, energy infrastructure offers a compelling case: it is both a beneficiary of the AI and electrification megatrends and a hedge against the sector's cyclical downturns.

Google and Kairos Power to deploy first advanced nuclear plant in Tennessee Valley under order book agreement

Google, Kairos Power, and the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) announced on 08/18/25 a new power purchase agreement (PPA) between Kairos Power and TVA, Kairos Power’s Hermes 2 Plant in Oak Ridge, Tenn., will deliver up to 50 MWe (MW) of reliable, 24/7 energy to the TVA grid that powers Google data centers in TVA’s service area.

TVA is the first U.S. utility to sign a PPA to buy electricity from an advanced, GEN IV reactor. Hermes 2 is the first deployment under Kairos Power’s landmark deal with Google to enable 500 MWe of new, advanced nuclear capacity to come online by 2035 in support of Google’s load growth.

To accelerate the delivery of clean energy to Google, Kairos Power will increase Hermes 2’s output from 28 MW to 50 MW generated by a single reactor, which is scheduled to begin revenue operations in 2030.

Kairos said initially the units for Google will include a single 50-MW reactor, with three subsequent power plants that would each have two 75-MW reactors.

Through this agreement, Google will receive the clean energy attributes from the Kairos plant through the TVA system to further decarbonize its data center operations in Montgomery County, TN, and Jackson County, AL.

Google / Kairos Master Agreement

TVA will purchase electricity from Kairos Power’s Hermes 2 plant starting operations in 2030. In this initial phase of the collaboration, Kairos and Google will procure clean energy attributes from the plant through TVA to help power Google data centers in the region with locally sourced clean energy 24/7 365.

Under the agreement, Kairos Power will develop, construct, and operate a series of advanced reactor plants and sell energy, ancillary services, and environmental attributes to Google under Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs).

Google said by committing to a so-called order book framework with Kairos, instead of buying one reactor at a time, it is sending a demand signal to the market and making a long-term investment to speed development of SMRs. Milestone-based accountability is baked into the agreement will establish confidence in Kairos Power’s ability to deliver throughout the long-term partnership.

“Our partnership with Google will enable Kairos Power to quickly advance down the learning curve as we drive toward cost and schedule certainty for our commercial product,” said Mike Laufer, Kairos Power CEO and co-founder.

Kairos will have to navigate complex approvals through the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), but already has clearance to build a demonstration reactor in Tennessee, which could start operating in 2027.

The Hermes Low-Power Demonstration Reactor is the first and only Generation IV reactor to be approved for construction by the NRC and the first non-light-water reactor to be permitted in the US in over 50 years. Hermes is a non-power version of Kairos Power’s fluoride salt-cooled high temperature reactor, the KP-HFR.

Kairos has also begun construction on a new reactor-grade salt production facility at its manufacturing development campus in Albuquerque, New Mexico.

Kairos Power: The Reactor Technology

Kairos Power’s technology uses a molten-salt cooling system, combined with a ceramic, pebble-type fuel, to efficiently transport heat to a steam turbine to generate power. This passively safe system allows the reactor to operate at low pressure, enabling a simpler more affordable nuclear reactor design.

Instead of water, which is used in traditional reactors, Kairos uses molten fluoride salt as a coolant. The molten salts transfer heat away from the reactor core. The heat can then be used either to produce electricity or for industrial processes such as oil refining, desalination, and steel production.

These reactors have several inherent safety advantages. The first, and possibly the most important, is that the reactor is operated at low pressure because the coolants never approach boiling point. Even in an accident, there would be no force expelling materials from the reactor, and no high-pressure containment system would be required to prevent such a release.

The plant will use TRISO coated particle fuel. TRISO – or “tristructural-isotropic” – fuel particles contain a spherical kernel of enriched uranium oxycarbide surrounded by layers of carbon and silicon carbide, which contains fission products.

Other major data center users, including Microsoft and Amazon, have recently turned to nuclear power to support the energy intensive needs of data centers supporting artificial intelligence.

Aalo Closes $100M Series B Funding

Aalo, an Austin, TX, developer of microreactors announced that Aalo has closed a $100M Series B financing led by Valor Equity Partners, with participation from new and existing investors including Fine Structure Ventures, Hitachi Ventures, Crosscut, NRG Energy, Vamos Ventures, Tishman Speyer, Kindred Ventures, 50Y, Harpoon Ventures, Crescent Enterprises, Alumni Ventures, MCJ, Gaingels, Perpetual VC, and Nucleation Capital, among others.

In a press statement the firm said, “We now have the capital to build our first nuclear power plant, the Aalo-X, which we’re aiming to bring to zero-power criticality next summer. This could be the first advanced nuclear power plant to turn on in the US in decades. This is not just a test reactor, but rather a full plant that will produce electricity.”

A unique aspect of the use of the funding is that Aalo is planning to put an experimental data center right next to it. This will be the first time a nuclear plant and data center are built together.

The firm also noted that in the past year, the firm finished the build-out of a 40,000 sqft pilot factory, and our full-scale non-nuclear prototype.

Aalo’s Master Plan

Serve the data center market.

Build Aalo-X to prove product-market fit: speed, reliability, and economics for data centers. Then build thousands of Aalo Pods (five Aalo-1 reactors and one turbine per Pod), to power data centers at scale.

Bring the cost down and expand.

Enter many more markets, e.g. municipal utilities (for whom GW-scale reactors are too big), desalination, industrial process heat, and more. Data centers are only 1% of the power market globally, so there are a lot of other markets to go after.

Make a more powerful reactor.

Our next reactor will be approximately 10x more powerful, in a similar physical form-factor to the Aalo-1 (still with a focus on mass manufacturability and road transportability). This will bring down the cost of electricity further, getting us closer to our mission of 3 c / kWh.

KHNP And Westinghouse Ink Nuclear Energy Agreement

(NucNet) According to multiple news media reports published in South Korea, Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power (KHNP) and Westinghouse have set up a joint venture for US and European projects as they move on from a legal settlement that has been criticized by politicians in Seoul. Top level political leaders in South Korea immediately criticized the deal as being “unfair.”

The proposed joint venture paves the way for South Korean nuclear firms to expand in the US. The South Korean 1400 MW PWR completed the NRC’s safety design review n April 2019. The NRC approved a rule to certify the APR-1400 standard design. In September 2018, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission gave the APR-1400 Standard Design Approval, and in September 2019 it received a design certificate valid for 15 years.

The agreement with Westinghouse comes after KHNP was awarded a 26 trillion won (€16 billion, $18 billion) contract in June to build two nuclear power plants at Dukovany in the Czech Republic,

According to the news media reports, KHNP ceded leadership of nuclear projects in Europe to Westinghouse when it settled the dispute in order to secure the Dukovany contract.

As a result, KHNP is said to be barred from entering the nuclear markets of European Union member states – except the Czech Republic – the US, the UK, Japan and Ukraine. This means it is restricted to pursuing projects in Southeast Asia, Central Asia, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, South America, and Turkey. In effect the two firms carved up the potential global market for PWR reactors.

According to press reports, KHNP and its parent company Korea Electric Power Corporation also agreed to pay Westinghouse $825 million in goods, services and royalties per exported reactor over the next 50 years.

Westinghouse had accused the South Korean company of infringing on its intellectual property, claiming KHNP’s APR1000 and APR1400 plant designs use its licensed technology.The January settlement removed a major hurdle for a KHNP-led consortium to sign the final Dukovany contract in June.

KHNP has withdrawn from bidding for nuclear deals in the Netherlands, Slovenia and Sweden in the past year. The company also said this week it had pulled out of a potential Polish project.

Oyster Creek NJ Site Tagged to Host Four 320 MW SMRs

The Asbury Press (NJ) and the Associated Press report that Holtec International proposes building four small modular reactors (SMRs), a solar field, and battery storage at the former Oyster Creek nuclear plant site in Lacey, NJ.

The firm, which has a Camden, NJ, SMR manufacturing plant, wants to build four 300 MWE SMRs, a solar energy field and utility-scale battery storage at the site of the former Oyster Creek Generating Station.

Holtec, one of the world’s largest nuclear energy component manufacturers, purchased the former nuclear plant and its property in 2019 and has been decommissioning the 1960s-era nuclear facility. Now Holtec sees the property as an excellent location for a new power project, because of the Lacey, NJK, existing transmission line connections to the larger electrical grid.

Holtec is currently deploying its small modular reactors, or SMR-300s, at the Palisades Nuclear Plant in Covert, MI. The company said Oyster Creek’s project, if permitted and approved, would follow the Michigan project.

Oyster Creek’s four modular reactors would each produce 320 MW of electricity, or 1,280 MW. By comparison, twice that of the old Oyster Creek plant generated 637 MW. Being four separate units, the design has an advantage compared to one large nuclear reactor: each unit can be powered down and refueled independently, without powering down the entire system.

General Fusion Gets $22M Bump from Investors

General Fusion, a Canadian nuclear fusion energy startup, announced that it had been thrown a lifeline in the form of $22 million in fresh funding. The firm’s burn rate caused it face cash crunch.

Last May the company laid off at least 25% of its employees in May in a bid to shore up its stretched finances. At the same time, CEO Greg Twinney wrote an open letter pleading for funding. The additional cash will give General Fusion some breathing room, though not much.

According to the Toronto Globe and Mail newspaper, a subset of General Fusion’s existing investors ultimately was a “pay to play” round. This is a financing structure where existing investors must participate to maintain their ownership stakes — that included Chrysalix Venture Capital, Gaingels, Hatch, MILFAM, JIMCO, PenderFund, Presight Capital, Segra Capital Management, and Thistledown Capital. PenderFund and Segra gained board seats as part of the deal. General Fusion was founded in 2002 and before this round had raised $440 million, according to PitchBook.

Though the company described the round as “oversubscribed,” the $22 million falls far short of the $125 million that the company was reportedly seeking. Adam Rodman, chief investment officer at Segra Capital, told The Globe and Mail that the $22 million was “the least amount of capital possible” to help the company hit the next scientific milestone.

Just months before signaling a cash crunch, General Fusion activated its latest device, Lawson Machine 26 (LM26), a half-scale prototype of a commercial-scale reactor. The new funding will give the company more time to run LM26 as it attempts to hit key scientific milestones. The fact that the company met an important internal technical milestones helped boost investor confidence in the fusion project.

General Fusion is pursuing what’s known as “magnetized target fusion.” Inside its reactor, electricity flows through deuterium-tritium fuel — heavy hydrogen isotopes — generating a magnetic field to contain the plasma. That plasma is then compressed by a liquid lithium wall that is pressed inward by steam-driven pistons. The combination should drive the temperature and pressure inside the plasma high enough to trigger a fusion reaction.

General Fusion said it is still pursuing scientific breakeven, though it didn’t provide a timeline. The company also listed two intermediary goals: heating plasmas to 10 million degrees Celsius and 100 million degrees Celsius.

Investors told the news media that given the limited size of the fresh funding, it seems likely that General Fusion will shoot for the most achievable milestones to convince investors to cut a new round of checks. The company may have bought itself a few precious months, but unless it can deliver promising results, it may find itself back in the same tight spot it was in during May.

Meralco Partners with South Korean Firms to Advance Nuclear Energy in the Philippines

The Manila Times reports that MANILA Electric Co. (Meralco) said that it had signed agreements with several South Korean firms to advance its push for nuclear energy in the Philippines via the development and use of small modular reactors (SMRs). Meralco believes that SMRs are a future-ready energy solution, particularly for off-grid areas in the country.

South Korea has several SMR designs under development. In June 2024 the 100MWe SMART100 small modular reactor design has been granted standard design approval by South Korea’s Nuclear Safety and Security Commission.

According to a report by World Nuclear News, SMART is a 330 MWt pressurised water reactor with integral steam generators and advanced safety features. The unit is designed for electricity generation (up to 100 MWe) as well as thermal applications, such as seawater desalination, with a 60-year design life and three-year refuelling cycle.

While the basic design of the SMART is complete, development has been stalled by the absence of any orders for an initial reference unit. It was developed by KAERI, which had planned to build a demonstration plant to operate from 2017.

“The upgraded model is now ready for global export, particularly to Saudi Arabia, a key partner in the development of this technology,” KAERI said.

In September 2019, South Korea and Saudi Arabia agreed to collaborate on the commercialization of the SMART SMR. Under the memorandum of understanding, the two countries agreed to work together to refine the design of the SMART reactor.

Korea will also assist in gaining Saudi design approval of the reactor, as well as cooperating in the construction and operation of a SMART reactor in Saudi Arabia. The partners will also promote the SMART design to other Middle Eastern and Southeast Asian countries considering the use of small reactors.

Domestic Collaborations in South Korea

A key domestic partnership is with DL Engineering & Construction to explore the deployment of SMRs in the Philippines and conduct feasibility studies, site assessments, and long-term strategic planning. The distribution utility also conducted site visits and strategic dialogues in South Korea with its existing partners, Korea Hydro and Nuclear Power, Samsung C&T Corp., and LG Energy Solutions.

Through its energy education unit, Meralco Power Academy, Meralco also signed a memorandum of understanding with Kepco International Nuclear Graduate School, where Meralco will be sending scholars beginning March 2026.

This initiative is part of Meralco’s Filipino Scholars and Interns on Nuclear Engineering program through which the company aims to build a skilled workforce.

Meralco also discussed potential collaborations with Korea Electric Power Corp. on smart grid modernization, storm hardening, and energy transition strategies, particularly on advanced metering infrastructure rollout, grid automation, data analytics, and distributed energy resource integration.

“Our strategic engagements in South Korea underscore our commitment to the responsible development of nuclear energy,” Meralco Executive Vice President and COO Ronnie Aperocho said.

Nuclear Waste Could Provide Fuel For Fusion Energy

Expensive and rare tritium means ‘breeding’ techniques are needed

(American Chemical Society) Researchers at Los Alamos National Laboratory have unveiled simulations showing how radioactive nuclear waste could be repurposed to generate tritium, the rare hydrogen isotope that fuels nuclear fusion.

Terence Tarnowsky, a physicist at Los Almos, will present his findings at the American Chemical Society’s autumn 2025 meeting. His research suggests that decades of stored waste might help unlock a cleaner, virtually limitless energy.

Nuclear fusion that uses the isotopes deuterium and tritium as fuel is seen as a promising pathway for generating energy, mainly because it requires lower energy input compared to other fusion reactions.

However, because tritium is rare and expensive, “breeding” techniques will be needed to provide enough of it for sustainable fusion power generation.

Current global supplies, largely sourced from Canadian CANDU heavy-water reactors, amount to around 25 kg, worth about $33 million (€28m) per kg.

Tritium is produced in CANDU reactors as a byproduct of neutron interactions with the heavy water that is used as both moderator and coolant. According to ScienceDirect.com, approximately 130 grams of tritium are generated annually in a typical CANDU reactor.

Globally, the size of installed CANDU reactors varies some as small as approximately 200 MW (India) to 800 MW in Canada. Romania is currently completing two 700 MW PHWR type reactors at its Cernavoda site.

Nuclear fusion does not always require tritium. While the most commonly discussed fusion reaction, deuterium-tritium fusion, does involve tritium, other fusion reactions are possible. Deuterium-deuterium fusion, for example, can occur without tritium, although it requires higher temperatures and is less efficient.

Without a reliable tritium pipeline, commercial fusion plants cannot scale up. A single 1,000 MW fusion reactor would require more than 55 kg of tritium per year, far beyond current supply.

Tarnowsky’s proposal centers on accelerator-driven systems that bombard spent nuclear fuel with particles. This process triggers reactions that generate neutrons, which can then be harvested to produce tritium through a series of nuclear transitions.

Computer simulations suggest that a 1,000 MW system could produce about 2 kg of tritium annually, rivalling the total yearly output of all Canadian reactors. A key advantage to Tarnowsky’s system would be the efficiency of tritium production. He projects that the design would produce more than 10 times as much tritium as a fusion reactor at the same thermal power.

Tarnowsky now plans to work out the cost for tritium production, and evaluate the efficiency and safety of the hypothetical reactor design.

In the past five years, South Korea has consistently ranked as Vietnam’s largest foreign direct investor and one of its leading trade partners.

According to data from the General Department of Customs, two-way trade between the two countries reached nearly USD 50 billion in the first seven months of this year. Vietnam’s exports to South Korea totaled USD 16.3 billion, while imports from South Korea amounted to USD 33.7 billion.

Vietnam’s exports to South Korea are dominated by high-tech and consumer goods. Computers, electronics, and components topped the list with USD 4.7 billion, followed by phones and accessories (USD 2.3 billion), machinery and spare parts (nearly USD 1.8 billion), and textiles (USD 1.5 billion).

In return, Vietnam imports mainly production-related goods and intermediate materials, including over USD 20 billion in electronics and components, more than USD 2.7 billion in machinery and tools, and over USD 1.2 billion each in raw plastic materials and petroleum products.

The economic ties between the two countries are not only strong in volume but also deeply complementary. Vietnam has become a manufacturing and export hub for many South Korean conglomerates. Conversely, South Korea provides Vietnam with essential machinery, technology, and raw materials for domestic production.

South Korea currently holds the top position in foreign direct investment (FDI) in Vietnam, with a cumulative registered capital of around USD 87–92 billion across more than 10,100 projects. This accounts for approximately 24.1% of project numbers and 18.2% of total FDI in Vietnam.

Key sectors attracting investment include electronics manufacturing, supporting industries, textiles, infrastructure development, and industrial real estate. Samsung Electronics alone has invested over USD 22 billion, making Vietnam its largest global smartphone and component production base. LG Display recently committed an additional USD 1 billion to expand its OLED screen factory in Hai Phong, raising its total investment to USD 5.6 billion. Meanwhile, Hana Micron invested another USD 930 million in a semiconductor packaging project in Bac Giang.

In contrast, Vietnamese investment in South Korea remains modest, focusing mainly on restaurants, food services, and other service sectors. This presents a significant opportunity for Vietnamese firms to expand into the Korean market and gain expertise in management and technology.

Toward a USD 150 billion trade target

According to the Ministry of Industry and Trade, the Vietnam-Korea Free Trade Agreement (VKFTA) and the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) have made Vietnam increasingly strategic in South Korea’s supply chain diversification plans. Korean demand for Vietnamese agricultural products, seafood, and garments remains robust and steady.

Last year, Vietnam-South Korea bilateral trade reached USD 81.5 billion, up 7.3% year-over-year. Earlier this year, the two countries agreed on a target to grow their trade to USD 150 billion by 2030, with a focus on balance and sustainability.

To realize this goal, South Korea’s Minister of Trade, Industry and Energy, Ahn Duk-geun, proposed enhanced cooperation in industrial and energy sectors. He called for both countries to promote collaboration in the supply chain of critical minerals by jointly implementing the Essential Mineral Supply Chain Technology Cooperation Center project. The initiative aims to create favorable conditions for Korean enterprises to invest in LNG power, clean energy, and nuclear energy projects in Vietnam.

The Ministry of Industry and Trade is proactively promoting Korean investment in key Vietnamese industries, including LNG power, port infrastructure, nuclear energy with small modular reactors, electric vehicle and battery manufacturing, production of machinery, equipment, components, consumer goods, and exports - particularly goods targeting the Korean market.",https://static-images.vnncdn.net/vps_images_publish/000001/00000Q/2025/8/25/vietnam-targets-korean-investors-for-key-sectors-like-energy-and-evs-3231914aea914da1b716a93905108021-2223.webp?width=0&s=S_-AESY9l_kwxbOgdkBf1A,N,,2025-08-25 04:58:23.379282

Speaking at the release of the AEO’s second-quarter 2025 monitoring report on renewable energy, energy transition, and climate change, Jamal Al-Loughani said the region must adopt multiple energy sources.

The AEO, formerly the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries, was restructured and renamed following a Saudi proposal adopted during its 113th ministerial meeting in Kuwait in December 2024. The move reflects efforts to expand its mandate beyond petroleum to cover the full spectrum of energy developments.

The restructuring comes as rapid transformations reshape the global energy sector, compelling Arab states to adapt to broader trends in clean technology and sustainable investments.

“Diversification of the energy mix is essential, but no source should be excluded,” Al-Loughani said in a statement to Kuwait News Agency.

“Oil and gas will continue to dominate with a share of over 50 percent both now and in the future,” he added.

The secretary-general attributed oil and gas’s continued dominance primarily to growing demand across all economic sectors, including transportation and electricity, and their increasing necessity in various industries such as petrochemicals, fertilizers, and heavy manufacturing.

He said increased investment and innovation by the organization’s member states in clean technologies like carbon capture, utilization, and storage will make the petroleum industry more sustainable and reliable in meeting growing energy demand.

The report noted a “significant global expansion in the renewable energy sector during the second quarter 2025, driven by major investments and supportive policies.”

China maintained its global leadership, accounting for half of the world’s solar capacity, advancing the largest floating wind turbine, and beginning construction on the world’s biggest hydroelectric dam.

In the US, clean energy provided most of the electricity for three consecutive months for the first time. India also saw a sharp rise in added renewable capacity, supported by solar projects.

Al-Loughani said many Arab nations have adopted policies supporting renewables based on economic diversification. Despite this positive momentum, he also said the sector faces challenges, most notably political and regulatory instability in some markets.

“Enhancing the infrastructure for renewable energy projects is no longer an option but has become a necessity,” as climate risks increase significantly alongside growing global interest in renewable sources, he added.

The AEO secretary-general outlined the Arab world’s potential for competitively priced green hydrogen production, which can be used for decarbonization directly or through derivatives like ammonia. This could attract foreign investment, create quality jobs, improve trade balances, and add value through exporting low-carbon products.

“Achieving success in energy transitions requires aligning ambitions with executive capabilities through adopting realistic steps, pumping long-term investments, and establishing reliable regulatory frameworks,” he said, adding that effective energy transitions are no longer just an environmental issue but a foundation for economic stability.

A significant financing gap remains, with over 90 percent of global clean energy investments since 2021 going to advanced economies and China, despite 80 percent of future energy demand growth coming from developing nations, Al-Loughani said. This reflects a structural imbalance that must be addressed to ensure a just and effective global energy transition.

He also highlighted nuclear power as a pivotal strategic option for enhancing global energy security and reducing emissions, with small modular reactors opening new prospects. Furthermore, he identified critical metals markets as a strategic element for the clean energy transition, though geopolitical constraints could pose crucial tests for global supply chains.

Regarding the digital economy, Al-Loughani said that data centers are now a vital part of global infrastructure, and their role is expected to grow with the advancement of artificial intelligence. Sustaining this growth requires major coordination to ensure clean power and develop innovative solutions to reduce consumption.

He also said climate change is no longer a long-term challenge, but a reality that requires urgent global action for adaptation, mitigation, and protection.

Al-Loughani added that the UN’s COP30 conference must be a turning point that is not limited to achieving ambitions, but also includes justice, equity, and finance for those who face the risks of climate change.

He also cited artificial intelligence as holding significant potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by improving energy efficiency, distribution, and disaster management.",,N,,2025-08-25 07:03:35.109676

FAQs About Fluorspar in Electric Vehicles What is the difference between fluorspar and fluorine?","What is Fluorspar and Why is it Critical for Electric Vehicles?

Fluorspar, also known as fluorite, is a mineral composed of calcium fluoride (CaF₂) containing 51.1% calcium and 48.9% fluorine by weight. This mineral serves as the primary global source of fluorine for industrial applications, particularly in the rapidly expanding electric vehicle sector. Despite receiving less attention than lithium, fluorspar plays an equally crucial role in battery production.

The Chemical Composition and Properties of Fluorspar

Fluorspar is classified as calcium fluoride (CaF₂) and typically occurs in cubic crystals. These crystals can display a remarkable variety of colors including purple, blue, green, yellow, and completely colorless specimens. The mineral has a hardness of 4 on the Mohs scale and is characterized by its distinctive fluorescence under ultraviolet light—a property from which the element fluorine derives its name.

Commercial fluorspar is categorized into three main grades, each serving different industrial purposes:

Acid-grade (acidspar): Contains ≥97% CaF₂ and is primarily used for chemical applications, particularly in battery manufacturing

Metallurgical-grade: Contains 85-95% CaF₂ and is used in steel production as a flux to reduce melting points and remove impurities

Ceramic-grade: Contains 85-96% CaF₂ and is used in glass and enamel manufacturing to create opacity and improve durability

Historical Uses vs. Modern Applications in Clean Technology

Fluorspar has been utilized in industrial processes for centuries, with traditional applications centered around metallurgy and chemical manufacturing. Historical uses include:

Steel manufacturing, where it serves as a flux to reduce melting temperatures and remove impurities

Aluminum production, where it's used to lower the electrolytic bath's melting point

Refrigerant production, with chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and their replacements requiring fluorine derived from fluorspar

However, the growth trajectory of fluorspar demand has shifted dramatically with the rise of clean energy technologies. Modern applications that are driving increased demand include:

Lithium-ion battery manufacturing for electric vehicles and energy storage

Semiconductor production, where ultra-high purity hydrogen fluoride is essential for etching silicon wafers

Nuclear fuel processing, which requires uranium hexafluoride for enrichment

The U.S. Geological Survey has classified fluorspar as a critical mineral due to its essential role in clean energy technologies and potential supply chain vulnerabilities. As EV production scales up globally, critical minerals energy security continues to grow in parallel.

How Does Fluorspar Enable EV Battery Technology?

Fluorspar isn't merely an additive in lithium-ion batteries—it's a fundamental component used extensively throughout the battery production process, affecting multiple critical components that determine battery performance, safety, and longevity.

The Role of Fluorine in Battery Electrolytes

The electrolyte enables lithium ions to flow between the anode and cathode, making it essential for battery function. Lithium hexafluorophosphate (LiPF₆) is the predominant electrolyte salt used in commercial lithium-ion batteries, and its fluorine content comes directly from fluorspar.

Quantity required: A 100 kWh battery requires approximately 17.5-24 kg of LiPF₆

Fluorine content: This represents 13.1-18.1 kg of fluorine

Performance benefits: Enables optimal ionic conductivity (>10 mS/cm at room temperature) and electrochemical stability across a wide voltage window

Stability functions: Forms a stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer that protects the electrodes and prevents continuous electrolyte decomposition

Despite ongoing research into alternative electrolyte systems, battery industry experts confirm that fluorinated electrolytes remain superior for commercial applications due to their unique combination of properties. Major battery manufacturers including CATL, LG Energy Solution, and Samsung SDI continue to rely on LiPF₆-based electrolytes for their mainstream products.

Fluorinated Binders in Battery Electrode Manufacturing

To create functional electrodes, active materials must be bound together and attached to current collectors. This critical function relies on fluorinated polymers, particularly polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF).

Primary binder material: Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF)

Quantity in batteries: A 100 kWh battery uses approximately 6-8 kg of PVDF

Fluorine content: Contains 3.5-4.75 kg of fluorine

Key properties: Provides excellent adhesion to current collectors, chemical stability against electrolyte degradation, and electrochemical performance across wide temperature ranges (-40°C to +60°C)

PVDF's unique properties make it particularly well-suited for lithium-ion batteries. It remains stable in the presence of aggressive electrolyte components and doesn't degrade during charging and discharging cycles. This stability contributes significantly to battery longevity and safety.

Graphite Anode Purification Process

The graphite used in battery anodes must meet extremely high purity standards. This purification process relies heavily on hydrofluoric acid (HF) derived from fluorspar.

Purification method: Raw graphite is refined using hydrofluoric acid to remove silicate impurities

Consumption rate: Processing anodes for a 100 kWh battery requires 7.5-15 kg of HF

Fluorine content: Contains 7-14 kg of fluorine

Quality impact: Ensures the graphite meets the stringent purity requirements (>99.95%) for battery applications

The purification process is essential for producing battery-grade graphite that can withstand thousands of charge-discharge cycles. Impurities in the graphite would otherwise lead to capacity loss, reduced cycle life, and potential safety issues. While alternative purification methods are being researched, HF-based processes remain the industry standard for achieving the necessary purity levels.

Beyond these three primary applications, fluorinated compounds are also used in separator materials and as electrolyte additives that enhance battery performance and safety. The pervasive use of fluorine throughout the battery manufacturing process underscores fluorspar's critical role in enabling the electric vehicle revolution.

What Are the Quantitative Requirements for Fluorspar in EVs?

The scale of fluorspar demand for electric vehicle production is substantial and often underappreciated in discussions about battery materials. Concrete numbers reveal the magnitude of this requirement and help forecast future demand growth.

Fluorspar-to-Battery Capacity Ratio Analysis

A direct relationship exists between battery capacity and fluorspar requirements:

Conversion ratio: Approximately 1.1 kg of fluorspar is needed per 1 kWh of battery capacity

For a typical 100 kWh EV battery:

Total fluorine required: 31.1-51.7 kg (average of 41.4 kg)

Lithium content comparison: Approximately 11 kg of lithium

Raw fluorspar equivalent: Approximately 109.5 kg

This means a standard Tesla Model S with its 100 kWh battery pack requires roughly 110 kg of fluorspar just for battery production. This requirement is particularly striking when compared to lithium, the namesake element of lithium-ion batteries. By weight, a battery requires approximately four times more fluorine than lithium, highlighting fluorspar's overlooked importance in the supply chain.

Comparative Material Requirements in EV Batteries

Material Amount Required for 100 kWh Battery Primary Application Fluorspar ~109.5 kg Multiple battery components Lithium ~11 kg Cathode active material Graphite ~70-100 kg Anode material Nickel ~40-80 kg (depending on chemistry) Cathode material Cobalt ~4-30 kg (depending on chemistry) Cathode material

This comparison illustrates that fluorspar requirements are substantial compared to other critical battery materials. Different battery chemistries also impact fluorspar demand in varying ways:

LFP (Lithium Iron Phosphate) batteries still require similar amounts of fluorine for electrolytes and binders, even with their cobalt-free chemistry

NMC (Nickel Manganese Cobalt) batteries use comparable fluorine quantities but have different overall material profiles

Solid-state batteries under development may actually increase fluorine requirements due to specialized fluorinated interface materials

Forecasting Future Demand Based on EV Growth Projections

Current global EV battery production: ~500 GWh (2023)

Projected global capacity by 2030: 3-4 TWh according to BloombergNEF's New Energy Outlook 2023

Corresponding fluorspar demand: 3.3-4.4 million tonnes annually for EV batteries alone

Compound annual growth rate (CAGR): Estimated at 25-30% through 2030

These projections indicate that EV battery production alone could require 3-4 million tonnes of fluorspar annually by 2030, representing a significant portion of current global production (approximately 7 million tonnes according to the U.S. Geological Survey). This growth trajectory creates both challenges and opportunities for the fluorspar supply chain.

Regional demand forecasts show particular concentration in areas with rapidly growing EV manufacturing capacity:

China: Projected to require 1.5-2 million tonnes annually by 2030

Europe: Estimated demand of 0.8-1.2 million tonnes annually by 2030

North America: Forecasted demand of 0.6-0.9 million tonnes annually by 2030

The fluorine intensity of batteries is significantly higher than most other critical minerals on a per-kWh basis, creating a substantial but often overlooked demand driver for global fluorspar markets.

Why is Fluorspar Supply Chain Security Becoming Critical?

As electric vehicle adoption accelerates globally, securing stable supplies of fluorspar has become a strategic priority for manufacturers and governments alike. Several factors contribute to the growing concern about fluorspar supply chain security.

Global Production and Concentration Risks

The global fluorspar market faces significant concentration risks that could impact availability and pricing:

Top producing countries: China (60% of global production), Mexico (15%), Mongolia (~5%)

Supply vulnerabilities: Geographic concentration, export restrictions, processing bottlenecks

Price volatility: Historical fluctuations of 30-40% annually based on supply constraints

China's dominance in fluorspar production creates particular concern, especially given past precedents with export quotas and restrictions on other critical minerals. The U.S. Geological Survey reports that China has implemented export controls on fluorspar in the past, creating price spikes and supply uncertainty for international buyers.

Beyond raw material production, the processing infrastructure for converting fluorspar to battery-grade fluorine compounds is even more concentrated. High-purity hydrogen fluoride production, a key intermediate step, requires specialized equipment and expertise that exists in a limited number of facilities globally.

Environmental Considerations in Fluorspar Mining

Environmental factors also affect the security and sustainability of fluorspar supply:

Water usage: Processing requires significant water resources, typically 3-5 cubic meters per tonne of concentrate

Waste management: Tailings contain potential contaminants requiring careful containment

Land reclamation: Post-mining restoration presents challenges, particularly for open-pit operations

Regulatory landscape: Increasingly stringent environmental standards affecting production costs and project development timelines

Environmental scientists note that responsible fluorspar mining can be achieved with proper water management and waste containment systems. However, implementing these best practices adds to production costs and may limit the development of new deposits in environmentally sensitive areas.

Strategic Initiatives for Supply Chain Resilience

In response to these challenges, various stakeholders are pursuing initiatives to enhance fluorspar supply chain security:

Domestic resource development: Nations including the U.S., Canada, and European critical materials countries are actively supporting exploration and development of local fluorspar resources

Recycling potential: Research into technologies for fluorine recovery from spent batteries and other fluorine-containing waste streams

Substitution research: Ongoing efforts to reduce fluorine dependency in battery technologies, though commercial viability remains distant

Strategic reserves: Consideration of stockpiling programs similar to those established for rare earths and other critical minerals

The U.S. Department of Energy identifies fluorspar as a critical material for clean energy supply chains, while the European Union's Critical Raw Materials Act 2023 includes fluorspar in its list of strategic raw materials. These designations have prompted increased government support for domestic fluorspar project development.

Transportation and logistics considerations further complicate fluorspar supply security. The mineral's relatively low value-to-weight ratio makes long-distance transportation economically challenging, creating advantages for deposits located near processing facilities or end-users. This factor has prompted interest in developing integrated supply chains that minimize transportation requirements.

How Are Battery Technologies Evolving Regarding Fluorspar Use?

The battery industry continues to evolve, with implications for future fluorspar in electric vehicles demand patterns. Research and development efforts are exploring various approaches to battery chemistry, some of which could affect fluorine requirements.

Next-Generation Battery Chemistries and Fluorine Requirements

Different emerging battery technologies have varying implications for fluorspar demand:

Solid-state batteries: May require different fluorinated compounds but potentially in higher quantities due to specialized fluorinated interface materials

Sodium-ion batteries: Currently still utilize fluorinated electrolytes and binders similar to lithium-ion batteries

Lithium-sulfur: Reduced fluorine requirements per kWh but still dependent on fluorinated components for stability

Flow batteries: Generally lower fluorine intensity per kWh but face challenges in mobile applications

Battery researchers acknowledge that while progress is being made on alternative electrolyte systems, fluorinated compounds remain superior for commercial applications in the near term. Major battery manufacturers are investing billions in research and development, but fluorine-free batteries are not expected to reach commercial scale before 2030 for most applications.

The U.S. Department of Energy's ARPA-E program has funded several research initiatives focused on developing fluorine-free battery technologies, recognizing both the supply chain vulnerabilities and environmental considerations associated with fluorinated compounds. However, these alternatives typically face performance trade-offs, particularly in energy density, cycle life, or operational temperature range.

Recycling and Circular Economy Approaches

Recycling presents another pathway to reducing primary fluorspar demand:

Current status: Limited commercial-scale fluorine recovery from batteries

Technological barriers: Complex separation of fluorinated compounds from mixed waste streams

Economic factors: Recovery economics improving with scale and technology advancements

Regulatory drivers: Emerging battery recycling mandates in EU, Asia, and North America

Battery recycling innovations are advancing rapidly, but most current processes focus on recovering high-value metals like cobalt, nickel, and lithium rather than fluorinated compounds. The relatively low value of fluorine compared to these metals has limited investment in fluorine recovery technologies. However, as battery volumes increase and processing technologies improve, the economics of fluorine recovery are expected to become more favorable.

The European Union's proposed Battery Regulation includes specific targets for recovery of battery materials, which could drive increased investment in technologies that can recover fluorinated compounds from end-of-life batteries. Similar regulatory frameworks are being considered in other regions, potentially accelerating the development of circular economy approaches for fluorine.

Research Directions for Reducing Fluorine Dependency

Several research avenues are being pursued to reduce fluorine requirements in batteries:

Alternative binders: Water-based binders showing promise for specific applications, particularly in lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries

Novel electrolytes: Research into non-fluorinated ionic liquids and polymer electrolytes

Process innovations: Less fluorine-intensive graphite purification methods using alternative acids or thermal treatments

Performance trade-offs: Balancing reduced fluorine use against battery performance metrics such as energy density, cycle life, and safety

Technical comparisons show that current fluorine-free alternatives typically face performance limitations. For example, aqueous electrolytes offer improved safety but operate in a narrower voltage window, reducing energy density. Similarly, alternative binders may provide adequate adhesion but often show reduced chemical stability or temperature tolerance compared to PVDF.

While complete elimination of fluorine from battery technologies remains a long-term research goal, incremental reductions through optimized formulations and processing techniques offer more immediate potential for reducing fluorspar demand per kWh of battery capacity.

What Does the Investment Landscape Look Like for Fluorspar?

The growing recognition of fluorspar's importance to the energy transition is creating new investment opportunities and challenges. Understanding the development timeline, economics, and risk factors is essential for stakeholders considering involvement in this sector.

Emerging Fluorspar Projects and Development Timelines

Several regions are seeing increased activity in fluorspar project development:

North America: Projects under development in Canada, Mexico, and the United States aim to reduce import dependency

Europe: Exploration and development initiatives in Spain, Germany, and the United Kingdom support EU critical minerals strategy

Australia: Emerging projects linked to broader critical minerals strategies and Asian market access

Development timeline: Typically 5-8 years from discovery to production for major fluorspar projects

The capital requirements for developing new fluorspar projects vary significantly based on scale, location, and processing requirements. Major projects typically require $100-500 million in capital investment according to mining industry estimates. This substantial capital requirement creates barriers to entry, particularly for junior mining companies.

The permitting process for fluorspar projects can be complex due to the mineral's chemical properties and potential environmental impacts. Environmental permitting typically requires comprehensive water management plans, tailings storage facility designs, and mine reclamation innovation strategies. These factors contribute to the extended development timeline for new projects.

Integration with Broader Critical Minerals Strategies

Fluorspar is increasingly included in national critical minerals policies:

National policies: Inclusion in critical minerals lists in US, EU, Japan, and Australia

Financial incentives: Tax benefits, grants, and loan guarantees for domestic production

Supply chain mapping: Increasing focus on tracking fluorine from mine to battery

International partnerships: Emerging government-to-government agreements on mineral security

The U.S. Defense Production Act provides funding mechanisms for critical mineral projects, including those focused on fluorspar and downstream fluorine compounds. Similar programs exist in the European Union under the European Raw Materials Alliance and in Japan through JOGMEC (Japan Oil, Gas and Metals National Corporation).

These government initiatives are creating more favorable conditions for fluorspar project development, particularly for projects located in regions seeking to reduce import dependency. Mining industry analysts note increasing investor interest in fluorspar projects due to these policy supports combined with projected demand growth from the EV sector.

Risk Assessment for Fluorspar-Dependent Industries

Investors and industrial consumers of fluorspar must consider several risk factors:

Supply disruption scenarios: Potential production impacts from supply constraints

Price sensitivity: Battery cost implications of fluorspar price volatility

Technological obsolescence: Monitoring alternative technologies that could reduce demand

Regulatory considerations: Evolving environmental standards affecting production and use

Battery manufacturers and automotive companies are increasingly including fluorspar in their supply chain risk assessments. Some are pursuing vertical integration strategies or long-term supply agreements to mitigate these risks. Others are supporting research into alternative technologies that could reduce their exposure to fluorspar supply constraints.

Project financing for fluorspar developments faces particular challenges due to the mineral's relatively low profile compared to other battery metals investment options. Educating investors about fluorspar's critical role in the EV supply chain remains an ongoing challenge for project developers. However, increasing awareness of supply chain vulnerabilities is gradually improving the financing environment for well-positioned projects.

How Can the Fluorspar Supply Chain Support Sustainable EV Growth?

Ensuring adequate and sustainable fluorspar supplies will be crucial to meeting ambitious electric vehicle adoption targets. This requires balancing production expansion with environmental stewardship and technological innovation.

Balancing Supply Expansion with Environmental Stewardship

Sustainable development of fluorspar resources requires attention to environmental impacts:

Best practices in mining: Water recycling, energy efficiency, and waste minimization

Processing innovations: Less chemical-intensive beneficiation methods

Certification schemes: Emerging standards for responsibly produced fluorspar

Life cycle assessment: Comprehensive environmental footprint analysis

Environmental scientists note that fluorspar mining typically has a lower carbon intensity than many other critical minerals. However, water management remains a particular challenge for fluorspar operations. Advanced water recycling technologies can significantly reduce freshwater consumption, with some modern operations achieving water recycling rates above 80%.

Proper handling of fluorine-bearing wastes requires specialized containment systems to prevent environmental contamination. Tailings storage facility design has advanced significantly in recent years, with increased focus on long-term stability and minimizing seepage risks. These improvements contribute to more sustainable operations but also increase capital and operating costs.

Technological Innovations in Fluorspar Processing

Several technological advances are improving the efficiency and sustainability of fluorspar production:

Improved recovery rates: Advanced flotation and separation technologies increasing yield from ore

By-product recovery: Extracting valuable co-products like rare earths from fluorspar ores

Energy efficiency: Reducing the carbon footprint of processing through equipment optimization

Modular processing: Smaller, more flexible processing facilities that can be located closer to mines

Advanced sensor-based sorting technologies allow for more precise separation of fluorspar from waste rock, reducing the amount of material that requires energy-intensive processing. Some operations report 15-20% reductions in energy consumption through the implementation of these technologies.

The recovery of valuable by-products can significantly improve the economics of fluorspar operations. Many fluorspar deposits contain rare earth elements, barite, or other valuable minerals that can be recovered through modified processing circuits. This co-production model enhances resource efficiency and economic viability.

Policy Recommendations for Sustainable Development

Policy frameworks can support sustainable fluorspar development:

Resource mapping: Comprehensive geological surveys to identify new deposits

Permitting efficiency: Streamlined but rigorous approval processes

Research funding: Support for fluorine efficiency and recycling technologies

International standards: Harmonized approach to responsible production

Government geological surveys play a crucial role in identifying and characterizing potential fluorspar resources. Enhanced funding for these activities can accelerate the discovery of new deposits, particularly in regions seeking to develop domestic supply chains.

Permitting processes that are both efficient and environmentally rigorous are essential for responsible resource development. Some jurisdictions are implementing ""one-stop-shop"" permitting approaches that coordinate multiple regulatory requirements while maintaining high environmental standards.

Research funding for technologies that improve fluorine efficiency in batteries or enable fluorine recovery from waste streams can support long-term sustainability goals. Public-private partnerships have proven effective in accelerating these technology developments.

International standards for responsible fluorspar production could help ensure that increased production doesn't come at the expense of environmental or social values. Industry associations and multilateral organizations are beginning to develop such standards, though implementation remains at an early stage.

FAQs About Fluorspar in Electric Vehicles

What is the difference between fluorspar and fluorine?

Fluorspar is the mineral form of calcium fluoride (CaF₂), while fluorine is the elemental form (F) that is extracted from fluorspar for industrial applications. Fluorspar serves as the commercial source material from which fluorine compounds are produced for various uses, including EV batteries. The mineral contains 48.9% fluorine by weight, making it the most economical source of this reactive element for industrial purposes.

Can fluorspar be recycled from used EV batteries?

While technically possible, commercial-scale recycling of fluorine compounds from EV batteries remains limited. Current battery recycling focuses primarily on recovering valuable metals like lithium, cobalt, and nickel. The relatively low value of fluorine compounds compared to these metals has limited investment in fluorine recovery technologies. However, as battery volumes increase and technologies improve, fluorine recovery is expected to become more economically viable. Emerging EU battery regulations may accelerate this development by establishing specific recovery targets for battery materials.

Are there alternatives to fluorspar in battery production?

Research is ongoing into alternative battery chemistries that reduce or eliminate fluorine dependency. However, current commercial lithium-ion batteries still rely heavily on fluorinated components for optimal performance. Complete substitution remains a long-term research goal rather than an immediate solution. Alternative electrolyte systems face challenges in matching the performance of fluorinated electrolytes, particularly in terms of electrochemical stability, conductivity, and temperature range. Similarly, alternative binders typically show reduced chemical stability or temperature tolerance compared to fluorinated polymers.

How does fluorspar mining impact the environment?

Fluorspar mining can have environmental impacts including water usage, potential acid mine drainage, and habitat disruption. However, modern mining practices implement various mitigation measures such as water recycling, progressive reclamation, and tailings management to minimize these impacts. The environmental footprint of fluorspar mining is typically lower than that of many other critical minerals in terms of carbon intensity, but water management remains a particular challenge. Advances in water recycling technologies have enabled significant reductions in freshwater consumption at modern operations.

Will fluorspar become a supply bottleneck for EV production?

Without significant investment in new production capacity, fluorspar could potentially constrain EV manufacturing growth. However, increased awareness of its importance is driving exploration and development of new sources, which could alleviate potential supply constraints if developed in a timely manner. The typical 5-8 year development timeline for new fluorspar projects means that investments made now will be crucial to meeting projected demand in the 2030 timeframe. Government support through critical minerals strategies is helping to accelerate some project developments, particularly in regions seeking to reduce import dependency.

Moreover, 2025 could set the U.S. record for new power-plant construction, beating the 58 gigawatts added in 2002 at the height of a natural-gas plant boom.
There’s little hope that the pace of gas-plant construction will match the current one for solar installations.
Absent some reworking of U.S. energy policy, the country is heading for a time of decreasing power-plant construction just when we desperately need it to accelerate.","The U.S. is still on track to build a record amount of new solar capacity this year, even as the Trump administration works to obstruct renewables.

As it stands, the power industry is building more solar than any other type of power plant, which has been the case for several years running. Roughly 12 gigawatts of new solar capacity joined the grid in the first half of the year, and 21 gigawatts more are slated for completion by the end of the year, according to a recent survey by the federal Energy Information Administration.

Solar thus will contribute more than half of the expected 64 gigawatts of new power capacity additions this year. Adding in battery storage and wind installations, clean energy is on track to deliver 93% of new power-plant capacity this year, the EIA predicted in February. Moreover, 2025 could set the U.S. record for new power-plant construction, beating the 58 gigawatts added in 2002 at the height of a natural-gas plant boom.

Those facts reflect a set of hopeful trends: The U.S. is building power plants at a record pace; nearly all of those new plants will not emit carbon emissions; and, since renewables and batteries cost far less to operate than fossil fuel plants, they exert downward pressure on electricity costs. These are all good things to see at a time when demand for new power production is soaring — thanks to electrification, industrial growth, and an AI computing bubble — and consumers are grappling with steadily rising electricity rates.

Of course, these trends could prove short-lived, because the Trump administration is actively working to obstruct the buildout of clean and cheap energy.

This summer’s signature Republican domestic policy law targeted wind and solar with early termination of their tax credits, effectively raising the cost to deploy these types of power plants. The executive branch has sought to halt or inhibit offshore wind and renewable development on public lands. Simultaneously, the Trump administration is giving an artificial boost to fossil-fuel plants. The Department of Energy is invoking emergency powers to block the planned shutdown of the J.H. Cambpell coal-fired plant in Michigan, forcing customers to pay millions of dollars extra to preserve an outdated, uneconomical facility. Analysts fear the DOE could repeat this tactic with other uneconomic fossil-burning plants that are scheduled to retire.

Any clean power plants coming online this year were planned, permitted, and undergoing construction before Trump’s policy shifts took effect (though his officials have found ways to interrupt construction that was fully permitted, like the Empire Wind project off the coast of New York). In that sense, this year’s buildout offers the last snapshot of what it looks like when the electricity industry serves market demand with modern technologies absent active resistance from the U.S. government.

It’s still possible that momentum will carry the solar industry to another record year in 2026. Developers effectively need to start construction by the first half of 2026 to claim the full tax credit, and the administration recently tightened the longstanding tax rules on what counts as ​“starting,” further upping the pressure to get going. Historically, an impending tax-credit cliff incites a temporary rush to begin solar projects in time to qualify.

It will take a few years, then, for the Trump-era energy policies to fully remake the market landscape for solar. There’s little hope that the pace of gas-plant construction will match the current one for solar installations.

Emphasis was placed on the need for energy storage and the adoption of new technologies to meet future energy demands. Government schemes like the PM Surya Ghar Yojana and PM Kusum Yojana are playing a key role in helping households and farmers transition to clean solar energy.

India’s solar manufacturing sector includes key components like solar modules, solar PV cells, and ingots and wafers. Producing these within the country supports the domestic economy and reduces dependence on imports.

In just one year, solar module manufacturing capacity nearly doubled—from 38 GW in March 2024 to 74 GW in March 2025. Similarly, solar PV cell manufacturing rose from 9 GW to 25 GW.",https://www.qatar-tribune.com/watanqatartribune/uploads/images/2025/08/25/296606.jpg,N,,2025-08-25 07:03:44.012805

The round was led by Catalytic Capital for Climate and Health, a division of Singapore-based Temasek Trust, and climate-focused private investment firm Kibo Invest.
The process works by pumping seawater and splitting it, isolating the hydrogen, oxygen, acid and base using renewable electricity.
Culver City-based Clairity Technology, an air capture carbon dioxide removal startup, raised nearly $6.8 million in seed funding in February.","The world’s most abundant resource – the ocean – does for free what startups in 2024 raised $200 million to do: remove carbon from the atmosphere.

Yet this vast body of water – covering nearly three-quarters of Earth – could be the key to solving two of the largest environmental challenges the world faces: weaning off fossil fuels in favor of green energy sources on top of absorbing existing carbon emissions from the air.

At least, that’s what Equatic is banking on for the future.

The Santa Monica-based clean energy company announced in mid-August it raised $11.6 million in series A funding. The round was led by Catalytic Capital for Climate and Health, a division of Singapore-based Temasek Trust, and climate-focused private investment firm Kibo Invest.

“Truly innovative carbon management technologies are needed to mitigate climate change before the consequences become irreversible,” John Browne, the chairman of Equatic’s advisory board, said in a statement.

“By removing carbon dioxide and simultaneously generating green hydrogen, Equatic’s solution provides unique advantages in terms of cost and scalability,” said Browne, who is also the former chief executive of British Petroleum and a founder of venture firm BeyondNetZero,

Equatic’s proprietary platform captures carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and in turn produces green hydrogen using one single process that can be scaled. The process is meant to boost the ocean’s natural ability to draw in copious levels of carbon, store it permanently and in turn produce hydrogen. Not to minimize the ocean’s competence, but Equatic says its commercial plants can absorb carbon 99,000 times faster than the ocean, which covers 71% of the globe. The process works by pumping seawater and splitting it, isolating the hydrogen, oxygen, acid and base using renewable electricity.

“Truly scalable climate solutions must work with nature,” Equatic’s website states. “The power of the ocean is in its chemistry. This chemistry endows the ocean with an unrivaled capacity to drawdown and permanently store anthropogenic carbon.”

A technology revival

While the ocean is an efficient – not to mention free – carbon sink, it disappointingly cannot scale or provide proprietary data insights the way many of these startups do. Equatic’s on-land plants are designed to accurately measure how much carbon dioxide is being removed from the atmosphere, a key metric for buyers that need to follow various government regulations on improving their carbon footprint.

As the likes of South Africa, the European Union, China, Kenya and Australia develop strict carbon footprint regulations, the need for carbon measuring and carbon removal technology has only grown. As of August, the sector has raised more than $373 million in venture funding – nearly double of what was raised in the entirety of 2024, according to PitchBook. Culver City-based Clairity Technology, an air capture carbon dioxide removal startup, raised nearly $6.8 million in seed funding in February. Carbon Ridge, a Santa Monica-based maritime carbon removal startup, announced in August it deployed the industry’s first centrifugal-based onboard carbon capture system on a shipping vessel. This was months after the International Maritime Organization voted to adopt a global policy regulation that would require ship owners to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 65% in 2040.

“There’s now an effective stick, essentially, that is requiring vessel owners and operators to reduce their emissions,” said Chase Dwyer, the chief executive of Carbon Ridge. “And so now they’re looking at: what is the lowest cost way for us to do that, and the most environmentally impactful?”",https://labusinessjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/PG10_Equatic_LABJ_plants_lead_Equatic.jpg,N,,2025-08-25 04:00:27.818087

Delivering a measurable impact The introduction of AI-driven permitting has resulted in productivity gains of 25-75% in energy project workflows.","The process of getting a permit for the construction of a renewable energy project can be long, difficult and expensive.

As renewable energy gains momentum, companies face prolonged, costly and complicated processes that act as barriers to prompt deployment.

Microsoft has been exploring ways in which technology can help to streamline this process and get more clean energy installations off the ground.

The concept originated during a hackathon event hosted by Microsoft, where developers and innovative thinkers brainstormed software improvements.

Since then, the tech giant has begun investing time and resources into revolutionising permitting using Gen AI.

For this project, Microsoft's team has put a special focus on nuclear power where planning and permitting can take more than a decade and cost millions of dollars.

""Permitting is the single biggest bottleneck to deploying clean energy fast enough to avoid runaway climate change,"" Microsoft says of the issue.

""That's not just inefficient – it's existential.""

Collaboration and innovation

The project's origins trace back to a 2022 gathering of the Repowering Coal Consortium at Microsoft's Dublin offices.

Fifty industry representatives from across the advanced nuclear sector identified permitting as a critical obstacle to scaling nuclear deployment from one reactor per decade in the Western world to the 2,500 needed globally to replace coal power.

Mark Tipping, Global Offshore Power to X Director at Lloyd's Register, believes this initiative will be hugely impactful.

""Together, we're tackling one of the biggest challenges in deploying nuclear technology, which is navigating complex, slow and costly licensing processes,"" he says.

The technical breakthrough

The team initially attempted to solve permitting challenges using traditional software approaches but found the problem intractable.

Conor Kelly, a key team member, explains: ""We first started trying without Gen AI... just normal software programming. It was an intractable problem.""

The breakthrough came with the realisation that generative AI could interact with vast datasets and format content as needed by varied licensing documents.

The combination of Azure OpenAI and Kernel Memory now allows for the rapid creation of draft permitting documents, reducing a process that once took extensive time down to mere minutes.

Microsoft's structured approach

The solution addresses three core challenges in the permitting process.

Automated document creation uses Gen AI to draft permitting documents from historical and project-specific data.

A Copilot system provides permitting engineers with access to entire regulatory datasets through ad-hoc queries, running entirely on companies' own Azure tenants to prevent data leakage.

Pre-submission review capabilities flag missing information before formal submission, reducing costly delays with regulators.

Delivering a measurable impact

The introduction of AI-driven permitting has resulted in productivity gains of 25-75% in energy project workflows.

Ed Essey, Senior Director of Business Value at Microsoft, believes this project speaks to the importance of pursuing ideas with curiosity and an open mind.

""It's incredible to see that what began as a side project got Microsoft into nuclear,"" he says.

The initiative has catalysed a cross-Microsoft task force on AI for permitting, with support from senior executives including Chief Sustainability Officer Melanie Nakagawa and President Brad Smith.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/38b678bfcefd854db7efa2ca38442c7f:9d1a779fde18e7376297bc2ad67a8fe4/work-graphics-2025-08-19t114430-947.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-08-25 04:00:31.694843

​The report outlines strategies to expand the adoption of Zero-Emission Vehicles (ZEVs) across all vehicle types, including school buses, as part of the state’s broader effort to combat air pollution and climate change.
​ The report highlights California’s leadership in clean transportation, noting that the state has already surpassed its goal of deploying 2 million ZEVs.
The CARB report also notes 17 other states and the District of Columbia have chosen to adopt at least part of California’s vehicle standards.
In addition, three of these states have established complementary regulations similar to California’s LCFS to further advance the clean vehicle market.","A new report reaffirms California’s commitment to zero-emission vehicle adoption and deployment despite attempts by Congress and the Trump administration to remove federal waivers that provide the state authority to cut pollution levels within its borders and elsewhere.

The state currently is involved in multiple lawsuits challenging the administration’s efforts to revoke the waivers approved by the Biden administration’s Environmental Protection Agency and others.

The California Air Resources Board (CARB) released the report last week in response to Gov. Gavin Executive Order N-27-25 in June that directs CARB and several other state agencies to recommend strategies that make clean transportation more affordable, reliable and accessible. ​The report outlines strategies to expand the adoption of Zero-Emission Vehicles (ZEVs) across all vehicle types, including school buses, as part of the state’s broader effort to combat air pollution and climate change. ​

The report highlights California’s leadership in clean transportation, noting that the state has already surpassed its goal of deploying 2 million ZEVs. ​With 56 ZEV manufacturers operating in the state and nearly 178,000 public or shared private electric vehicle chargers installed, California is setting the pace for the nation. ​

However, the CARB report notes that five of the 10 most polluted cities in the U.S. are in California, and millions of residents still live in areas with dangerously high ozone levels, especially in the Los Angeles area and the San Joaquin Valley. ​

To address these challenges, CARB recommends actions across six key areas: Private investment, incentives, infrastructure, fuel pricing, regulations, and procurement. CARB seeks to sustain the Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) program that utilizes credits from 200 participating companies and from utilities to subsidize clean fuels like renewable diesel and to continue taking advantage of other existing funding programs. It recommends backfilling the federal clean air vehicle tax credits that are set to expire at the end of next month and providing “reliable and consistent funding” to the agency and the California Energy Commission for ZEV deployment and infrastructure incentive programs.

Noting that infrastructure remains one of the largest barriers to ZEV adoption, the report highlights the need for increased reliability of and access to EV chargers, including timely repair. CARB also recommends streamlining permitting processes and utility energization timelines. This includes implementing flexible service connections and other strategies to eliminate delays in EV charging installation.

CARB also calls for unlocking the benefits of V2G by improving the energization process to enable vehicles to power homes and businesses or to export power to the grid during peak demand periods. This includes developing utility rates “that align EV charging and discharging with grid needs” and establishing incentives to automakers that build EVs that can provide backup power. CARB also writes that standards are needed for chargers to enable the use of vehicle-grid integration.

School buses are directly impacted by the state’s push for ZEV adoption. The report emphasizes the need for incentives and infrastructure to support the transition to zero-emission buses. ​For school districts, this could mean additional access to funding programs that make it easier to replace aging diesel buses with electric or even hydrogen-powered alternatives. ​Additionally, CARB says the focus on building reliable charging infrastructure could alleviate concerns about fueling capacity and range limitations. ​

For companies operating school buses, the report’s recommendations present both opportunities and challenges. The emphasis on private investment through programs like the LCFS could provide financial incentives for operators to transition their fleets. ​Additionally, the state’s focus on workforce development could help create a pipeline of skilled workers to maintain and operate ZEVs. ​

However, the transition will require careful planning. CARB states operators will need to navigate new regulations, invest in charging or fueling infrastructure and ensure their fleets meet the state’s reliability and durability standards. Collaboration with state agencies and local governments will be key to overcoming these hurdles.

The CARB report also notes 17 other states and the District of Columbia have chosen to adopt at least part of California’s vehicle standards. The demand in these states for clean transportation collectively represents 40 percent of the nation’s new light-duty vehicle market and 25 percent of the nation’s new heavy-duty vehicle market, which are three to four times that of California alone. In addition, three of these states have established complementary regulations similar to California’s LCFS to further advance the clean vehicle market.",https://i0.wp.com/stnonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/cropped-School-Bus_STN-Website.png?fit=32%2C32&quality=100&strip=all&ssl=1,N,,2025-08-25 04:00:19.389082

With strong leadership from Governor Landry, bold vision from President Trump, and Louisiana’s congressional delegation fighting for us, Project Cypress will become a global model for American innovation, industrial strength, and energy leadership.
When Louisiana leads, America wins – and with Project Cypress, we can lead today while building a stronger, more competitive energy future for generations to come.","Louisiana has always powered America – from offshore rigs to refineries to the plants that fuel our nation’s economy. At Heirloom, we’re proud to help write the next chapter by bringing new technologies that capture and commoditize carbon dioxide to help position Louisiana to lead the next great energy revolution, securing jobs, lifting rural communities, and keeping Louisiana competitive for decades.

President Trump has called for a new “Golden Era of American Energy Dominance,” urging the nation to unlock its full potential through expanded production and accelerated innovation. Governor Landry is advancing that vision with policies that drive energy growth and industrial innovation across Louisiana, laying the foundation for projects that strengthen America’s energy and industrial security.

One of the most promising examples is our participation in Project Cypress in Northwest Louisiana. At the Port of Caddo-Bossier where we’re building one of the nation’s first large-scale Direct Air Capture (DAC) facilities. Using our advanced technology, we will transform carbon dioxide into a high-value resource for fuels, materials, and manufacturing to strengthen Louisiana's new and existing industries, from AI to energy. With support from President Trump’s Department of Energy, Project Cypress will drive hundreds of millions in private investment and create high-wage jobs – exactly the kind of growth rural Louisiana parishes need to strengthen their tax base to fix schools and roads, and build stronger communities.

A New Engine of Growth for Northwest Louisiana

Project Cypress positions Louisiana to compete in a global industry worth more than $135 billion. This combined investment will spark a new wave of industry, turning captured carbon into opportunities that power advanced manufacturing, new fuels and stronger energy production that achieve the same prosperity that Louisianans have secured for generations.

Big players are already investing. We’re working with partners like United Airlines to advance next-generation aviation fuels. And tech companies driving the AI revolution are among our largest customers, using DAC to balance the energy intensity of data centers. These partnerships show that the world’s leading companies believe in what we are building here in Louisiana.

Smart federal policy set the stage – from granting Louisiana the authority to manage carbon storage to new incentives that drive private investment. Now it’s Louisiana’s turn to seize this opportunity, build the industries of the future, and create thousands of jobs.

Strong Leadership in Louisiana and Washington

This progress would not be possible without champions at every level.

With strong leadership from Governor Jeff Landry, support from House Speaker Mike Johnson, and bold vision for American energy competitiveness from President Trump, Louisiana has the champions it needs to ensure job-creators like us can succeed. Their leadership creates the conditions for innovation, job creation, and global competitiveness – and we’re proud to be part of that momentum.

Together, their leadership ensures Louisiana remains at the forefront of industrial growth, creating new industries and opportunities for generations to come.

A Model for National Security and Global Competitiveness

Project Cypress is strategically co-located with pipelines and industrial corridors to reduce costs and accelerate deployment – the same way Louisiana’s LNG boom was built. Once again, Louisiana is proving that energy dominance starts here, showing the nation how to lead an energy revolution from the ground up.

In a world where competitors are positioning against us, America cannot afford to fall behind. By embracing DAC as part of our energy mix; we’re strengthening national security – ensuring that the United States – not foreign adversaries – controls the technologies that will fuel industry and shape global energy production for decades to come.

We started Heirloom because we believe this is how America wins: by building the industries of the future around the strengths we already possess. Louisiana understands energy abundance, knows how to build resilient infrastructure, and has the skilled workforce to match. The same formula that made it a leader in oil, gas, and LNG will make it a leader in the next chapter of American energy.

Louisiana’s Next Chapter

Energy dominance is not a slogan. It’s a strategy – and it is being built right here in Louisiana. Project Cypress demonstrates how federal support and private innovation can create new industries, generate jobs, and keep America ahead of global competitors. While China and Europe are racing ahead with major investments, Heirloom is committed to ensuring that America leads this critical frontier.

Now is the time to double down. With strong leadership from Governor Landry, bold vision from President Trump, and Louisiana’s congressional delegation fighting for us, Project Cypress will become a global model for American innovation, industrial strength, and energy leadership.

We’re proud to be investing in Northwest Louisiana and partnering with local communities to build the industries of tomorrow.

In this context, BBVA is positioning itself as a key player in the energy transition, supporting clients with sustainable financing solutions and specialized advisory services tailored to today's challenges.
One of the leaders driving this momentum is Isidoro del Álamo, Head of Sustainability & Low Carbon Advisory at BBVA Corporate & Investment Banking.
The future of energy Is already underway For Isidoro del Álamo, the energy transition is a historic opportunity.
With teams like the one led by Isidoro del Álamo, BBVA positions itself as a strategic partner for companies committed to a low-carbon future.","The energy transition is no longer a challenge exclusive to the energy sector—it has become a cross-cutting priority affecting the entire global economy. The need to reduce CO₂ emissions is pushing industries of all kinds—from manufacturing and transportation to agriculture and services—to transform their processes toward more sustainable models. In this context, BBVA is positioning itself as a key player in the energy transition, supporting clients with sustainable financing solutions and specialized advisory services tailored to today's challenges.

One of the leaders driving this momentum is Isidoro del Álamo, Head of Sustainability & Low Carbon Advisory at BBVA Corporate & Investment Banking. From his team, he leads the support provided to companies that are transforming their business models as part of a sustainable and resilient growth strategy. “Our role goes far beyond the financial. We help structure complex transactions, identify new business opportunities, and support companies in their strategic decision-making,” he explains.

This team was established in 2021 as a strategic initiative by BBVA to strengthen its specialized sustainability advisory capabilities, with a clear focus on energy transition and decarbonization. It is a global and sector-specific team designed to offer comprehensive guidance, from the early stages of strategy definition to the execution of specific projects.

Unlike other approaches that are more product-centric, the Sustainability & Low Carbon Advisory team is product-agnostic: it integrates the bank’s product capabilities—from capital structuring, whether equity or debt, to financing—and combines them with services that go beyond traditional banking. These include advisory on strategic partnerships, commercial agreements, off-balance-sheet structuring, regulatory support, and the development of new business areas for clients.

In addition, the team is composed of professionals with highly technical and specialized backgrounds, coming from strategic consulting firms, investment funds, investment banks, corporate finance firms, and the corporate sector. This cross-sector and technical expertise allows for a differentiated approach, offering solutions tailored to each industry and geography. The team is currently present in Madrid, London, Paris, Mexico, and the United States.

The team led by Del Álamo specializes in key technologies for the green transition, such as hydrogen and its derivatives (ammonia, synthetic fuels for aviation or maritime transport); biomethane; carbon capture, usage and storage (CCUS); battery energy storage systems (BESS); geothermal energy; circular economy solutions—focused on recycling, packaging, and plastics; and natural capital, including biodiversity and water management, among others.

Clean technologies, green financing, and strategic collaboration

Del Álamo emphasizes that advancing clean technologies requires much more than financial resources. “It’s not just about offering capital, but about deeply understanding the sector, its cycles, and emerging technological opportunities,” he points out. That’s why BBVA goes beyond being a lender: it takes part in project structuring, advises on the formation of partnerships and commercial agreements, optimizes capital structures, facilitates access to different financing options, and designs solutions to manage transition-related risks.

""It’s not just about offering capital, but about deeply understanding the sector, its cycles, and emerging technological opportunities""

In recent years, the bank has been involved in pioneering projects related to green hydrogen, biomethane, and renewable energy, establishing itself as a strategic partner in the sector. BBVA has participated in the financing of the first carbon capture and storage projects in the United Kingdom—a key technology for achieving climate neutrality goals. More recently, it structured its first biomethane financing in Italy in partnership with Suma Capital, further solidifying its role as an expert partner in renewable energy beyond Spain.

A new horizon for sustainable finance

BBVA’s ambition is also reflected in its own commitments. The bank met its previous goal of channeling €300 billion in sustainable business between 2018 and 2025 a year ahead of schedule, in December 2024. Now, it has set a new target: to mobilize €700 billion between 2025 and 2029. “This goal reinforces our strategy of sustainability as a business opportunity and raises the ambition both in terms of volume and timeframe,” Del Álamo notes.

The timing is favorable: according to the International Energy Agency, the world must triple its renewable generation capacity this decade to meet the Paris Agreement goals. And Spain, with its natural resources and business landscape, could become one of Europe’s driving forces.

The future of energy Is already underway

For Isidoro del Álamo, the energy transition is a historic opportunity. “It’s not just an environmental challenge—it’s also a massive opportunity for industrial transformation, economic development, and job creation,” he says. His experience gives him a privileged view of what lies ahead: new technologies, new models of public-private collaboration, and a growing corporate awareness that places sustainability at the center.

Cases like the financing of sustainable assets in European markets—such as the recent biomethane project in Italy or carbon capture initiatives in the UK—demonstrate that the energy transition is a global effort, and BBVA has the expertise and specialization required to lead it.

With teams like the one led by Isidoro del Álamo, BBVA positions itself as a strategic partner for companies committed to a low-carbon future. Because the energy of tomorrow is being built today—and doing it right requires knowledge, ambition, and a long-term vision.",https://www.bbva.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/midjourney_cleantech_apertura-op2-1024x575.jpg,N,,2025-08-25 04:01:06.830090

The large SUV, a centerpiece of Hyundai Motor Group’s collaboration with battery maker SK On, recorded 14,391 sales across domestic and international markets through July, the company said. The vehicle was first released in South Korea in February.

The performance stands out against the backdrop of what analysts have dubbed the “EV chasm,” a slowdown in consumer appetite that has forced many automakers to scale back production and delay investment plans. Hyundai sold 4,789 units in South Korea, 4,745 overseas, and 4,857 through its new Metaplant America factory in Georgia.

Exports began in April, and by July, sales abroad had already surpassed domestic deliveries. The model has proved especially popular in the United States, where 2,086 vehicles were sold in just three months despite a broader downturn in EV sales.

Hyundai splits production between its plant in Asan, south of Seoul, which builds export models, and its $7.6 billion Georgia complex, which supplies the American market.

The localized output allows SK On, Hyundai’s battery partner, to take advantage of federal tax credits tied to the Trump administration’s clean energy laws.

SK On operates two battery plants in Georgia and is building a third, a 35-gigawatt-hour joint venture facility with Hyundai.

Analysts see the partnership as strategically significant: Hyundai gains a secure supply of batteries, while SK On deepens its foothold in the critical North American market.

Sitting idle - Some A$3 bln ($1.9 bln) of federal funding allocated to the state of Western Australia's energy transition has been sitting idle, with not a single dollar spent, the ABC reported. The cash from the Clean Energy Finance Corporation's Rewiring the Nation fund was first allocated to WA in Aug. 2023, and it took the state government more than a year to recommend four projects to be considered for the funding. A WA government spokesperson told the broadcaster the proponents are now undertaking further feasibility work. Yindjibarndi Energy Corporation is looking to use the funding on its Chichester Corridor project in the state's remote north, and said it expects to receive a decision on the funding in late 2027, while APA Group said they are still having discussions with potential customers for its projects.

Signal - A failed referendum aimed at restarting a nuclear power plant will heighten the pressure on Taiwan’s leaders to explore solutions for the island’s increasing energy needs, Bloomberg reported. Only around 22% of eligible voters participated in the vote on Saturday, with a majority supporting the restart of the Maanshan nuclear plant, missing the 25% threshold. Some argued that the result, even in its defeat, is sending a signal to the government that more people believe nuclear-based energy solutions should be considered. Taiwan, a global production hub of semiconductors, could see energy consumption from the manufacture of AI chips continue to grow, potentially muting its climate progress, according to a recent report from Greenpeace.

This shift reflects a broader sector trend: international developers are increasingly hedging against U.S. policy volatility by diversifying geographically.
Monitor Policy Cycles: U.S. energy policy is inherently cyclical, with presidential transitions often triggering abrupt regulatory shifts.
Conclusion: A Call for Prudence The U.S. offshore wind sector is at a crossroads.","The U.S. offshore wind sector, once hailed as a cornerstone of the green energy transition, now finds itself entangled in a web of regulatory and geopolitical uncertainty. For investors, the interplay between policy shifts, executive overreach, and market dynamics has created a high-stakes environment where even the most ambitious projects face existential risks. Ørsted, the Danish energy giant, epitomizes this tension, as its U.S. ventures—such as the Revolution Wind and Sunrise Wind projects—have been battered by abrupt regulatory reversals and financial cliffs. This article examines how policy instability is reshaping the investment calculus for offshore wind and what it means for the future of renewable energy stocks.

The Trump-Era Legacy: A Regulatory Vacuum

The roots of today's uncertainty lie in the Trump administration's (2017–2021) aggressive dismantling of renewable energy frameworks. Policies like the ""Unleashing American Energy"" executive order prioritized fossil fuels, halting offshore wind permits and leasing while accelerating oil and gas development. This created a vacuum of certainty, as developers like Ørsted were left to navigate a rapidly shifting regulatory landscape. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) of 2025 further exacerbated the crisis by eliminating tax credits for wind and solar projects unless construction began within 12 months of enactment. This policy forced companies to fast-track projects or face financial ruin, a strategy that proved unsustainable for many.

Ørsted's Revolution Wind project, 80% complete in 2025, was abruptly halted by the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) under ""unspecified national security concerns."" Despite being fully permitted, the project now faces a $575 million impairment, a stark reminder of how executive discretion can override market fundamentals. Such stop-work orders, justified by vague national security claims, have become a tool to stifle offshore wind development, favoring entrenched fossil fuel interests.

Financial Volatility and Strategic Retreats

The financial toll of this instability is evident. Ørsted's U.S. offshore wind portfolio has already incurred $6.275 billion in impairments, with a $9.4 billion capital raise in 2025 to stave off collapse. These figures underscore the fragility of offshore wind's business model under U.S. policy conditions. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) for offshore wind projects has risen by 3–4 percentage points since 2020, driven by higher interest rates and the shift to merchant (non-subsidized) project models. In the U.S., where regulatory uncertainty compounds these risks, the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) for offshore wind now ranges from $70/MWh to $157/MWh—far above the $30–$50/MWh range for onshore wind and solar.

The trade war with China has further inflamed costs, as tariffs on Chinese wind components (e.g., aluminum, steel) have inflated project budgets. For Ørsted, this has meant a strategic pivot to more stable markets. The UK, Germany, and South Korea now dominate its offshore wind pipeline, while emerging markets like Brazil and Vietnam offer lower political risk. This shift reflects a broader sector trend: international developers are increasingly hedging against U.S. policy volatility by diversifying geographically.

Strategic Considerations for Investors

For investors, the U.S. offshore wind sector presents a paradox. While the long-term demand for clean energy is undeniable, the short-term risks are acute. Here are three key considerations:

Diversify Across Jurisdictions: The U.S. market remains a high-risk, high-reward bet. Investors should balance exposure to U.S. offshore wind with onshore renewables in states like Texas and California, where state-level mandates and grid infrastructure provide greater stability.

Monitor Policy Cycles: U.S. energy policy is inherently cyclical, with presidential transitions often triggering abrupt regulatory shifts. Advocacy for state-level partnerships and grid modernization can mitigate federal-level risks.

Prioritize Resilient Markets: The UK, Germany, and South Korea offer more predictable regulatory environments. For Ørsted, these markets now account for over 60% of its offshore wind capacity, a strategic realignment that should be mirrored by investors.

Conclusion: A Call for Prudence

The U.S. offshore wind sector is at a crossroads. While its potential to decarbonize the grid is immense, the current policy environment—marked by regulatory arbitrariness and geopolitical tensions—demands a cautious approach. For Ørsted and its peers, the path forward lies in geographic diversification and strategic flexibility. Investors, in turn, must weigh the allure of U.S. market growth against the reality of policy-driven volatility. In this landscape, prudence—not optimism—will be the hallmark of successful capital allocation.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-25 03:00:58.780554

In one recent year, Saudi Arabia lost $11 billion on electricity generation.
If Saudi Arabia switched to solar power for electricity plants, it would free up for export the oil and gas it now uses domestically.
well, Saudi Arabia of solar.
I perceive Saudi Arabia to have talked a good game about renewables for some years, while nothing was done on the ground.","Ann Arbor (Informed Comment) – Saudi Arabia’s massive oil deposits and its 9.53 million barrels per day (bpd) of petroleum production make it an enormous carbon polluter and the foremost enemy of climate science and of electric vehicles.

Some 38% of Saudi power plants use petroleum and 62% of electricity generation is done by domestically produced fossil gas.

But here’s the paradox. Saudi electricity demand is currently growing 10% a year . The oil and gas supplied by the government to power plants is subsidized. If the kingdom sold the oil abroad instead at $67.76 a barrel (this weekend’s Brent crude price), it would make more billions for its Vision 2030 transition to a less hydrocarbon-based economy.

In one recent year, Saudi Arabia lost $11 billion on electricity generation.

If Saudi Arabia switched to solar power for electricity plants, it would free up for export the oil and gas it now uses domestically. Further, if it doesn’t switch, it can expect the country’s electricity demand to eat up more and more oil and gas every year, a gigantic opportunity cost, since it won’t make any money from exporting them and it will have to subsidize the locals, costing even more money.

So the smart play here is to go solar, right? I mean, Saudi Arabia is potentially the . . . well, Saudi Arabia of solar. And that is what the Saudi Public Investment Fund, which has nearly $1 trillion to play with, has decided.

Just last month, ACWA Power and a consortium inked $8.3 billion in green energy deals that will eventuate in seven solar and wind farms around the country. These power generation projects will add 15 gigawatts of further renewable capacity.

Just last week, ACWA made the announcement that three projects that will ultimately generate 2.7 gigawatts of electricity have actually already begun producing some electricity. The Saad 2 solar farm in the capital of Riyadh was certified for a further 365 megawatts, bringing its total capacity to a bit over 1.1 gigawatts, and it is at least partly online. Another, at Hail in the north-central part of the country, has thrown the switch and will produce 1.4 gigawatts all on its own when fully operational. In al-Qasim in the center of the kingdom, a solar plant is putting out 1 gigawatt of power, and will double its output when it is fully implemented.

Moreover, the prices are eye-popping. The solar plant at Hail is producing electricity for a little over 1.7 cents a kilowatt hour. The Saad 2 plant has a production cost of close to 1.8 cents a kilowatt hour. The energy produced at the solar farm at al-Qasim, presumably near the provincial capital of Burayda, has a cost of less than 1.7 cents a kilowatt hour.

In the GCC countries generally, fossil gas electricity generation costs 11 cents per kilowatt hour. So these solar farms are saving a ton of money.

I perceive Saudi Arabia to have talked a good game about renewables for some years, while nothing was done on the ground. Only about 1% of current power generation is wind and solar. But ACWA has carried out major renewables installations in Morocco, Egypt and the UAE. That some renewables generation has actually begun, and that further big deals have finally been signed suggest that this time the commitment is genuine.

Despite Riyadh’s propaganda campaign against the science of climate change (it helped destroy Twitter as a public platform for scientists by helping Elon Musk take it over), the Saudi elite knows very well that the earth is rapidly heating and that the global public is gradually turning against carbon pollution. Pilgrims to Mecca are increasingly at risk of deadly heat stroke. Since Saudi Arabia’s opulent prosperity almost entirely derives from its petroleum exports, they know that they have to find another way to make money.

So, they are diversifying. For some odd reason they’ve bought an interest in a lot of the video game companies, such as Scopely, Nintendo, Capcom, Tecmo and Koei Tecmo. I guess they think nerds will pay to play for decades to come.

The transition to a prosperous non-oil economy is going to be extremely expensive, especially since the kingdom can’t know when its oil may suddenly plummet in value. Economists suspect China has already reached peak oil this year, and that its petroleum imports will drop every year from here on in, since its transition to electric vehicles is proceeding so rapidly.

“Solar Kingdom,” Digital, Dall-E / Clip2Comic, 2025

China imports about 11 million barrels a day of petroleum. Global production is about 102 million barrels a day. If China starts importing only 10, and then 9, and then 8 mn bpd, that trend will put significant downward pressure on prices.

Year over year as of Q1 of 2025, the European Union importation of petroleum fell in value over 11% and in volume some 8%. This decrease probably has more to do with the EU attempt to wean itself off Russian oil because of the Ukraine War than with the rise of EVs. But EVs are part of the equation; in 2024, 1 in 7 new car sales in the European Union were electric. Over time, European consumption of petroleum will fall, as well.

So Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman and his advisers weren’t born yesterday. They read these numbers for a living.

So if they can free up petroleum for export now while there is still high demand at relatively high prices, that is a positive for them. Which means switching to renewable power plants.

The Saudi elite is not taking this step for altruistic reasons. But that it makes sense economically and technologically for them to move in this direction at all is a huge bellwether for all of us.

Although Beijing has engineered drops in coal-fired power output and carbon emissions, new coal projects are at a decade high, the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air and Global Energy Monitor said in a report on Monday reviewing the first half of 2025.

That trend is likely to continue over the next two years unless the government takes action, according to the report. Earlier pledges to relegate the fossil fuel to a supporting role haven’t been properly implemented, even as coal’s share of power generation has fallen to a nine-year low of 51% and renewables have risen to 60% of total installed capacity.

On the Wire

China’s economy is buckling under the weight of tariffs and a deep-rooted property crisis, yet stocks are extending their bull run — a disconnect that’s stirring doubts on the rally’s staying power.

China’s solar installations continued to slow in July, as developers waited for more details about a new policy that took effect in June and may affect renewables returns. Meanwhile, one of the giants of the industry, Longi Green Energy Technology Co., posted a narrower first-half loss as solar additions helped limit the impact of overcapacity.

Some US metal dealers are redirecting China-bound shipments of scrap copper through countries including Canada, Mexico and Vietnam in a risky move to avoid 10% import tariffs, according to people familiar with the matter.

At Heirloom, we’re proud to help write the next chapter by bringing new technologies that capture and commoditize carbon dioxide to help position Louisiana to lead the next great energy revolution, securing jobs, lifting rural communities, and keeping Louisiana competitive for decades.

President Trump has called for a new “Golden Era of American Energy Dominance,” urging the nation to unlock its full potential through expanded production and accelerated innovation. Governor Landry is advancing that vision with policies that drive energy growth and industrial innovation across Louisiana, laying the foundation for projects that strengthen America’s energy and industrial security.

One of the most promising examples is our participation in Project Cypress in Northwest Louisiana. At the Port of Caddo-Bossier where we’re building one of the nation’s first large-scale Direct Air Capture (DAC) facilities. Using our advanced technology, we will transform carbon dioxide into a high-value resource for fuels, materials, and manufacturing to strengthen Louisiana's new and existing industries, from AI to energy. With support from President Trump’s Department of Energy, Project Cypress will drive hundreds of millions in private investment and create high-wage jobs – exactly the kind of growth rural Louisiana parishes need to strengthen their tax base to fix schools and roads, and build stronger communities.

A New Engine of Growth for Northwest Louisiana

Project Cypress positions Louisiana to compete in a global industry worth more than $135 billion. This combined investment will spark a new wave of industry, turning captured carbon into opportunities that power advanced manufacturing, new fuels and stronger energy production that achieve the same prosperity that Louisianans have secured for generations.

Big players are already investing. We’re working with partners like United Airlines to advance next-generation aviation fuels. And tech companies driving the AI revolution are among our largest customers, using DAC to balance the energy intensity of data centers. These partnerships show that the world’s leading companies believe in what we are building here in Louisiana.

Smart federal policy set the stage – from granting Louisiana the authority to manage carbon storage to new incentives that drive private investment. Now it’s Louisiana’s turn to seize this opportunity, build the industries of the future, and create thousands of jobs.

Strong Leadership in Louisiana and Washington

This progress would not be possible without champions at every level.

With strong leadership from Governor Jeff Landry, support from House Speaker Mike Johnson, and bold vision for American energy competitiveness from President Trump, Louisiana has the champions it needs to ensure job-creators like us can succeed. Their leadership creates the conditions for innovation, job creation, and global competitiveness – and we’re proud to be part of that momentum.

Together, their leadership ensures Louisiana remains at the forefront of industrial growth, creating new industries and opportunities for generations to come.

A Model for National Security and Global Competitiveness

Project Cypress is strategically co-located with pipelines and industrial corridors to reduce costs and accelerate deployment – the same way Louisiana’s LNG boom was built. Once again, Louisiana is proving that energy dominance starts here, showing the nation how to lead an energy revolution from the ground up.

In a world where competitors are positioning against us, America cannot afford to fall behind. By embracing DAC as part of our energy mix; we’re strengthening national security – ensuring that the United States – not foreign adversaries – controls the technologies that will fuel industry and shape global energy production for decades to come.

We started Heirloom because we believe this is how America wins: by building the industries of the future around the strengths we already possess. Louisiana understands energy abundance, knows how to build resilient infrastructure, and has the skilled workforce to match. The same formula that made it a leader in oil, gas, and LNG will make it a leader in the next chapter of American energy.

Louisiana’s Next Chapter

Energy dominance is not a slogan. It’s a strategy – and it is being built right here in Louisiana. Project Cypress demonstrates how federal support and private innovation can create new industries, generate jobs, and keep America ahead of global competitors. While China and Europe are racing ahead with major investments, Heirloom is committed to ensuring that America leads this critical frontier.

Now is the time to double down. With strong leadership from Governor Landry, bold vision from President Trump, and Louisiana’s congressional delegation fighting for us, Project Cypress will become a global model for American innovation, industrial strength, and energy leadership.

We’re proud to be investing in Northwest Louisiana and partnering with local communities to build the industries of tomorrow.

(Reuters) -Oil prices edged higher on Monday after Ukraine stepped up attacks on Russia, fanning concerns Russian oil supply could be disrupted, while expectations of a cut in U.S. interest rates buoyed the outlook for global growth and fuel demand.

Brent crude futures rose 3 cents, or 0.04%, to $67.76 at 0342 GMT, and West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures gained 7 cents, or 0.11%, to $63.73.

Ukraine launched a drone attack on Russia on Sunday, which forced a sharp fall in the capacity of a reactor at one of Russia's biggest nuclear power plants and sparked a huge blaze at the Ust-Luga fuel export terminal, Russian officials said.

In addition, a fire at Russia's Novoshakhtinsk refinery, caused by a Ukrainian drone attack, was burning for the fourth day on Sunday, the acting governor of the region said.

The refinery sells fuel mainly for export and has an annual capacity of 5 million metric tons of oil, or around 100,000 barrels per day.

""Given the success that Ukraine is having with its targeting of Russian oil infrastructure ... the risks for crude oil are shifting to the topside,"" IG market analyst Tony Sycamore said.

Meanwhile, U.S. Vice President JD Vance said Russia has made ""significant concessions"" toward a negotiated settlement in its war with Ukraine on Sunday.

""They've recognized that they're not going to be able to install a puppet regime in Kyiv. That was, of course, a major demand at the beginning. And, importantly, they've acknowledged that there is going to be some security guarantee for the territorial integrity of Ukraine,"" Vance said on NBC's ""Meet the Press with Kristen Welker"" program.

However, U.S. President Donald Trump also renewed threats on Friday that he would impose sanctions on Russia if there was no progress toward a peaceful settlement in Ukraine in two weeks.

Investors' risk appetite has improved after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Friday signaled a possible interest rate cut at the U.S. central bank's meeting next month.

""A risk-on tone across markets boosted investor appetite across the commodities complex, aided by renewed supply side issues across energy and metals,"" ANZ analysts said in a note.

The ministry is in talks with the industry for such a list for ingot-wafers. ""Once that comes, we will see some clear commitments on the part of the industry to set up ingot and wafer manufacturing in India and I am sure in course of time polysilicon as well is going to come on a big scale,"" Sarangi said.

Dallas Innovates reported on the agreement between Fort Worth-based Paragon Energy Solutions and Oregon-based NuScale Power. NuScale holds the distinction of being the only SMR nuclear technology provider that has received design approval from the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

Paragon, meanwhile, specializes in safety products like its CoreVision Neutron Monitoring System technology and Highly Integrated Protection System that will be incorporated into NuScale's SMR tech and forthcoming energy plants.

NuScale is bullish about its future. Company CEO John Hopkins pointed to the Trump administration's recent supportive steps as well as approval of a 77-megawatt module as reasons for optimism, according to UtilityDive. The company expects to have a few customers finalized by the end of 2025.

Paragon says CoreVision will grant NuScale ""reliable, accurate, and modernized monitoring and control of reactor power levels,"" per Dallas Innovates. The HIPS is tailored to SMRs and will safeguard instrumentation and control systems with reliable, cyber-secure protection.

Nuclear fission, while imperfect, holds several advantages over dirty energy. As Robert Hayes, an associate professor of nuclear engineering at North Carolina State University, detailed, it isn't completely safe, but its risk level pales in comparison to coal and other energy sources.

SMRs add energy flexibility to the nuclear fission mix, as they are smaller and more flexible. That provides an avenue for areas that don't have sites for large plants and adds efficiencies through a modular design.

The passive systems, low power and operating pressure, and decreased reliance on external power or human intervention increase safety margins and reduce the chances of unsafe radioactivity releases, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency.

They can also be paired with clean energy systems like wind and solar to kick in more prominently in times of lower power generation, per the IAEA. Still, there are concerns about their safety, as expressed by Edwin Lyman of the Union of Concerned Scientists.

That hasn't stopped a raft of projects in Canada, at universities in the U.S., and from aspiring companies.

NuScale CEO John Hopkins expressed confidence that the partnership will bear fruit soon.

The DKSH warehouse covers about 56,100 square meters with an air-conditioning range of more than 41,000 square meters, according to the case study on the project by Tri Quanity Sdn Bhd. The typical annual electricity consumption of the entire warehouse averaged about 5.65 million kWh per year.

HTMS altered the chilling water loop system by fitting all the pumps with new silicon carbide seals while deploying the Maxwell Sub-Micron coolant. The Maxwell fluid was then injected into the pump discharge side of the HVAC system.

The targeted concentration of Maxwell fluid was achieved at 2% of liquid volume in the system. The injection also increased the system fluid density by 6%.

“This installation demonstrates that smart, science-driven HVAC technologies can deliver immediate cost savings and long-term sustainability benefits,” Thomas Grizzetti, CEO of HTMS, said. “We’re proud to partner with forward-thinking companies like Tri Quantity and DKSH who are helping to set the standards for energy efficiency in large-scale commercial facilities.”

HTMS says the Maxwell fluid is non-toxic and recyclable.

Energy efficiency is often termed as the “first fuel” in reduction of both consumption, costs and greenhouse gas emissions. The U.S. Energy Information Administration has estimated that HVAC systems account for approximately 40% of total energy consumption in commercial buildings and perhaps a third of usage in industrial facilities.

Construction began on Revolution Wind in January 2024 and is now 80% complete, according to Ørsted.
It’s one of five offshore wind projects under construction in U.S. waters.
The country currently has only one fully operational utility-scale offshore wind project, South Fork, near Long Island, New York.
In August 2023, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers co-signed the authorization of plans for Ørsted to build 65 wind turbines for the Revolution Wind project.","It happened again. For the second time this year, the Trump administration has halted the construction of a massive offshore wind farm being built to power blue states.

On Friday, the acting director of the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Matthew Giacona, ordered the Danish wind developer Ørsted to stop all construction on the nearly complete Revolution Wind offshore project so the federal government can ​“address concerns related to the protection of national security interests of the United States.” Giacona, a former lobbyist for offshore oil and gas companies, did not specify the nature of those concerns.

The move echoes an April order from the Interior Department that stopped all offshore work on New York’s Empire Wind project.

Last time, the controversial pause lasted just one month but cost the developer nearly $1 billion — and drove the project to the brink of cancellation. This time, with a Trump appointee now at the helm of BOEM, it’s unclear how long this costly work stoppage might last.

Construction began on Revolution Wind in January 2024 and is now 80% complete, according to Ørsted. The wind farm is being built off the coast of Massachusetts and Rhode Island in a federally designated ​“wind energy area” that was created after a five-year-long consultation between the state of Massachusetts, coastal towns, federal agencies, and branches of the military including the U.S. Navy, Coast Guard, and Army Corps of Engineers.

Once the 704-megawatt project is complete, its cables will come ashore in Rhode Island and its carbon-free electricity will be fed into New England’s regional grid and serve utility customers who saw their power bills skyrocket this past winter. It’s one of five offshore wind projects under construction in U.S. waters. The country currently has only one fully operational utility-scale offshore wind project, South Fork, near Long Island, New York.

President Donald Trump promised that America would see ​“no new windmills” on his watch. Friday’s order is just the latest attempt to make good on that pledge: In recent months the Trump administration has killed offshore wind leasing, paused permitting, and sunsetted tax credits critical to the economic viability of offshore wind farms.

The purpose given for Friday’s stop-work order — ​“national security interests” — has long-time wind industry insiders scratching their heads.

“There were no major military issues that came to the fore in New England,” said wind energy veteran Bill White in an interview with Canary Media. From 2009 to 2015, White represented Massachusetts on a BOEM-led intergovernmental task force focused on the responsible siting of offshore wind energy areas south of Martha’s Vineyard and Nantucket islands.

“Was the military at the table, represented and consulted with during this stakeholder process? The answer is: very much so,” said White, who for much of his time on the task force worked for the Massachusetts Clean Energy Center as senior director of offshore wind sector development.

White — who went on to oversee offshore wind as a CEO of Avangrid Renewables, one of the developers of Massachusetts’ embattled Vineyard Wind project — said he’s aware of national security issues that have been raised about proposed offshore wind projects near Maryland, Virginia, and North Carolina, which have coastlines dotted with large military installations.

In April 2023, for example, the Pentagon flagged proposed wind energy areas in the central Atlantic Coast as ​“highly problematic.” But the Pentagon has not raised those kinds of high-level concerns over Revolution Wind — or any of the projects being built in New England’s waters, according to White. The Pentagon did not return a request for comment.

Development of the Revolution Wind project began more than a decade ago. In 2013, Deepwater Wind New England LLC won a federal auction for two leases in the wind energy area designated by the intergovernmental task force; Ørsted later acquired those leases when it bought the company. From 2016 to 2020, the Danish firm assessed the site and continued to engage stakeholders, like local fishermen, according to BOEM records.

Between 2020 and 2023, Revolution Wind endured an extensive regulatory review, including from the Pentagon and the Federal Aviation Administration. Since wind turbines have the potential to affect air-traffic radar and aviation navigation, the FAA conducted an airspace analysis. The agency ultimately approved the project under the condition that all turbines be built to lighting and marking standards that would ensure they’re visible to aircraft at night.

In August 2023, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers co-signed the authorization of plans for Ørsted to build 65 wind turbines for the Revolution Wind project. The National Marine Fisheries Service, a branch of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, also signed the authorization.

During Revolution Wind’s long road to construction, it had strong support from neighboring states, which have made ambitious renewable energy commitments in recent years.

“The Trump administration’s stop-work order on Revolution Wind undermines efforts to expand our energy supply, lower costs for families and businesses, and strengthen regional reliability,” said Rhode Island Gov. Dan McKee, a Democrat, in a statement.

In a post to X, McKee said that he and Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont, also a Democrat, ​“will pursue every avenue to reverse the decision to halt work on Revolution Wind.” Lamont, in an Instagram post, called the order a ​“political move.”

This new fight between the two governors and the feds could play out similarly to the fight between New York Gov. Kathy Hochul and the Trump administration over the Empire Wind project earlier this year. After weeks of developer Equinor threatening to walk away from the halted project due to the high costs of delayed construction, the Trump administration reversed course and lifted the ban, claiming it had struck a deal with Hochul, a Democrat, to allow a natural gas pipeline to be built in the state.

On the day the Interior Department lifted the order, Secretary Doug Burgum thanked Hochul in a social media post for her ​“willingness to move forward on critical pipeline capacity.” But a representative for Hochul’s office told Canary Media at the time that ​“no deal on any natural gas pipeline was reached.”

The Trump administration, including U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin, has in recent months pushed for New England and in particular Massachusetts to build new gas pipelines.

McKee and Lamont — or perhaps Ørsted — could also opt for litigation, a route not taken by Hochul or Equinor during the Empire Wind drama.

The Trump administration’s stop-work order comes as Ørsted is seeking to raise billions of dollars from its shareholders to help complete Revolution Wind and its other fully permitted U.S. project, Sunrise Wind, after other financing options fell through.",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/Revolution-Wind-1st-turbine-September-2024.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=71b5b10ba7f6d4374c188ebad4c03d22,N,,2025-08-24 22:59:51.247741

Would it surprise you to hear at least 20%? Last year New Zealand’s government announced a $60m investment to explore furthering New Zealand’s geothermal potential and unlock new areas for industrial growth, tourism and trade.

The investment announcement was recently followed by the issuing of ‘From the Ground Up – a draft strategy to unlock New Zealand’s geothermal potential’, New Zealand’s first ever national Geothermal Strategy. The draft strategy seeks to develop a pathway for New Zealand to extend its international leadership in geothermal innovation, accelerate domestic energy resilience, and strengthen regional economic growth associated with geothermal development. Industry practitioners, researchers, iwi, energy companies and the public have until 12 September to submit feedback on the draft.

The Government is proposing to double geothermal energy use by 2040. Key to this will be the successful implementation of supercritical geothermal - a type of geothermal energy that utilises extremely hot and pressurised water found deep within the Earth's crust. If it can be harnessed, supercritical geothermal offers a cleaner energy source than fossil fuels, with potentially lower emissions. It also poses challenges around the depth of drilling and accessing of data to make informed decisions.

Dr John O’Sullivan says “This is where innovation is required. Geothermal energy was met with scepticism and uncertainty back in the 1950s and New Zealand still forged ahead and created pioneering work that has had a lasting impact. Now it's time to scale.”

O’Sullivan is a senior lecturer in engineering and co-director of the Geothermal Institute. Since 1978, the Geothermal Institute at the University of Auckland has produced more than 2,000 graduates who have lent their expertise to industry across the globe, as well as here at home. Many have worked on research and development at the Wairakei geothermal field. Graduates are also compelling ambassadors for New Zealand’s geothermal capability and ingenuity in this sector internationally.

“Industry is poised, talent is coming through, and the technology is moving fast, with advancements in areas such as remote sensing, big data and advanced digital tools to accurately model sub-surface geothermal resources. Working hand-in-hand with industry and Māori communities and strengthening our technical capability will be critical to fulfilling New Zealand’s geothermal potential. Our universities, public research organisations like Earth Sciences New Zealand, vocational training providers and industry innovators all have a part to play – collaboration will be the key to future success.”

Within the draft geothermal strategy, the government has highlighted the importance of education and promoting and developing career pathways in geothermal.

Mike Roger is the Strategic Growth Manager for Energy and Climate Innovations at UniServices, the University’s commercialisation and research translation company. He helps communities, industry and government build partnerships with our researchers in the energy space to find new pathways to create impact.

Roger says “Industry regularly brings us big problems that need solving, and the Geothermal Institute has been great at stepping up to meet those challenges. They’re very commercially minded, and the applied nature of their research and underlying expertise lends itself extremely well to developing creative solutions. To leverage future potential, it’s important to have support for initial infrastructure development though, to lower the barrier to entry. It’s very expensive to drill wells.”

The global geothermal landscape is changing rapidly, with the United States as well as countries in Europe, Asia, Latin America and East Africa increasing investment in exploration of options for clean energy to support sustainability and spur economic growth. Another motivating factor is energy security, with interest in reducing reliance on fossil fuels or precarious energy imports. New and emerging geothermal technologies – such as supercritical and enhanced geothermal systems, deep drilling, direct heat applications, and mineral co-extraction – are making geothermal increasingly accessible and reshaping the skills and R&D requirements of the sector.

Roger notes that New Zealand’s expertise in geothermal energy and associated technologies offer an opportunity to supercharge NZ Inc’s contribution to energy resilience and decarbonisation globally, opening up new areas for international engagement and leadership.",,N,,2025-08-25 00:00:45.708019

To meet this rising demand for electricity, energy production will need to expand dramatically and quickly.
What's being done about renewable energy?","The Texas economy could be one of the biggest losers from the ""Big Beautiful Bill"" that became law earlier this year, according to Bloomberg.

As the state's electricity needs surge, the bill's cuts to renewable energy incentives are projected to cause higher energy prices and potential electricity shortfalls, per Bloomberg. The result is expected to be slower economic growth.

""We will severely restrict economic growth,"" said Doug Lewin, an expert on Texas energy, per Bloomberg. ""Because we can't grow without energy.""

What's happening?

Under the new law, wind and solar energy projects across the U.S. will only qualify for tax incentives if construction begins by July 4, 2026, or are placed in operation by the end of 2027, according to E&E News.

Previously, these programs were slated to last until December 31, 2032, according to the EPA.

This change is projected to have an enormous impact on the future of energy production in Texas, which presently relies on renewable sources for 30% of its electricity, per Bloomberg.

BloombergNEF has predicted that the number of wind, solar, and battery-storage facilities brought online annually in 2035 will be 23% lower as a result of the new law. It is possible the new law will help to spur along some projects faster, at least, but there is not yet any data to support that notion.

With peak energy demand in Texas expected to nearly double from 85.5 gigawatts in 2023 to 150 gigawatts by 2030, per Bloomberg, Texas needs all of the power it can get.

""We're in an energy crunch,"" Joshua Rhodes, an energy expert at the University of Texas Austin said, per Bloomberg. ""We should be doubling down on everything we can build right now. Making things more expensive is antithetical to that.""

From 2020 to 2024, the Texas economy outperformed the U.S. as a whole, increasing its GDP by 51% versus 37% nationwide, according to Bloomberg. Much of this growth has been fueled by cheap electricity costs.

If new sources of electricity cannot be brought online fast enough to meet this growing demand, prices will increase, and Texas will lose its energy advantage.

Why does renewable energy production in Texas matter?

Expanding renewable-energy production is essential to meeting the nation's rising electricity needs, which are projected to grow significantly in coming years as massive new data centers consume large quantities of electricity.

Dirtier, non-renewable sources of energy simply cannot be brought online fast enough to meet this demand. Presently, there is a five-year waitlist for the turbines used in natural-gas-powered plants, according to Bloomberg.

By comparison, a massive new solar-and-battery facility in California was brought online just two years after shovels hit the ground, a remarkable turnaround time for a project of that scale and complexity.

Even in oil-and-gas-friendly Texas, non-renewables have made up just 6% of new energy capacity since 2020, with the remaining 94% coming from new solar, wind, and battery-storage facilities, per Bloomberg.

Some companies operating data centers have explored small modular nuclear reactors, with one company specializing in it, Oklo, formerly chaired by OpenAI co-founder Sam Altman — though nuclear projects also take years to get going and bring non-trivial safety risks, even if their energy generation comes without directly contributing to greenhouse gas pollution.

The situation in Texas is representative of the rest of the country. Data centers, which are used to run power-hungry AI models, consumed 4.4% of all U.S. electricity produced in 2023. That figure is projected to reach 6.7% to 12% by 2028, according to the Department of Energy.

To meet this rising demand for electricity, energy production will need to expand dramatically and quickly. If the increase in demand outpaces the available supply, electricity prices will go up for everyone.

What's being done about renewable energy?

Meeting growing energy demands will require an all-of-the-above approach to electricity production with an emphasis on the projects that can be brought online the most quickly. Relying on dirtier, nonrenewable sources of energy alone will be insufficient to the task.

While the challenge is massive, there are actions that individuals can take to make a difference. For example, by using your voice, contacting your elected representatives, and voting for political candidates who share your policy priorities, you can help to push for a return of the renewable-energy incentives necessary to meet rising energy needs.

Further, by installing solar panels on your home, you can reduce reliance on overtaxed energy grids while also ensuring that your home is powered by cleaner, renewable energy from the sun.

By pairing solar with a home-battery system, you can make your house more resilient in the event of a power outage while also potentially supplying power back to the grid when it is needed most, reducing the need for additional large-scale power plants.

EnergySage makes it easy to compare quotes from vetted local solar installers while also ensuring you take maximum advantage of tax credits and other available incentives, saving customers up to $10,000.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/MzivsgD66Vh8emLZXZazmQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD03OTk7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_cool_down_737/0482fec73b81e2d128309fe51b00fac7,N,,2025-08-24 22:00:05.955290

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Environmental Protection Agency on Thursday terminated a $7 billion grant program intended to help pay for residential solar projects for more than 900,000 lower-income U.S. households, in the latest Trump administration move hindering the nation’s shift to cleaner energy.

The funding, part of the Biden-era’s Solar for All program, was awarded to 60 recipients including states, tribes and regions for investments such as rooftop solar and community solar gardens. Solar, a renewable energy, is widely regarded as a way to introduce cleaner power onto the electrical grid and lower energy bills for American consumers.

Under Republican President Donald Trump, officials have pursued dozens of deregulatory measures related to federal rules intended to protect clean air and water. Last week, the EPA proposed rescinding the agency’s “endangerment finding” which serves as the scientific and legal basis for regulating planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions.",,N,,2025-08-25 08:01:56.070285

Refineries produce a slew of products so when we talk about SAF production, it is important to remember this is a small share of refined output.
Coordinated strategies are essential for decarbonization because aviation is just one part of the broader energy transition.","Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA’s SVP of Sustainability and Chief Economist, says the timing means the WSS can substantially influence the agenda for decarbonization. “The WSS is a forum for new ideas and fresh collaboration,” she says. “Thinkers, doers, and regulators will come together and decide how to make progress toward net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 and broader sustainability targets.”

The energy transition

The location of the WSS—Hong Kong ( 21-22 October)—is equally significant as Asia-Pacific is aviation’s fastest-growing market and notable for its SAF production opportunities. India, Malaysia, and Vietnam are just a selection of countries in the region that could play crucial roles in SAF production.

China, meanwhile, has a strong record in strategic planning and is invariably successful in implementing those plans, often before deadline. The country aims to be carbon neutral by 2060 with peak emissions occurring before 2030.

A SAF pilot project in China has been extended. The Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC)'s 14th Five-Year Plan calls for over 20,000 tons of SAF consumption in 2025 and a Sustainable Aviation Fuel Research Centre to develop standards and a certification system has been established. It is reported that more than 3 million tonnes of SAF production is either planned or in construction.

China’s ability to be a trend-setter in SAF is important as SAF will do the heavy lifting if aviation is to reach net-zero by 2050. But Thomsen emphasizes that decarbonization is not just an industry issue.

“The WSS will highlight radical collaboration,” she says. “That means correctly placing aviation’s efforts within the context of the global energy transition. This is a huge economic development opportunity, which will build new markets and industries and create jobs.”

Thomsen suggests that if individual industries try to find their own solution each one will fail. “But together it is possible to succeed,” she adds. “Aside from the economic implications, countries that are forward-looking in this area can achieve greater energy independence. Refineries produce a slew of products so when we talk about SAF production, it is important to remember this is a small share of refined output. The majority of renewable refined products will benefit other industries. This means that helping airlines obtain sustainable aviation fuel will give most other industries greater access to renewable fuels.”

Attracting investment

Investment is needed to fund new SAF production facilities and other sustainability initiatives. Certainly, money is available if investors think the returns will be there. The amount of finance available to artificial intelligence development speaks to the deep pockets that investors have if they believe in a project.

But the truth is that oil is bringing in about a 20% return while renewable energy is lagging at 5%. Bridging that gap requires the right policies and incentives from regulators.

The good news is that solar and wind power have already shown the way forward. SAF needs a similar level of investment to these now-established energy markets so regulators should be aware of the constituents of a good policy.

“The blueprint for success is there,” says Thomsen. “And it all fits together because this leads back to the idea of radical collaboration. This is not about giving money to aviation, it is about investing in the energy transition. SAF is just one part of the biofuel complex that will drive advances in renewable power.”

CORSIA

Other elements of the journey to net-zero carbon emissions will be under the spotlight at the WSS, from new technologies to green financing.

One key discussion point will be the Carbon Offsetting Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA). Mandatory reporting starts in 2027 but to date Guyana is the only country offering eligible emission units (EEU) for airlines to purchase.

Airlines are required to buy EEUs to meet the established baseline, but there is no requirement for countries to provide them. States need to authorize the release of credits for the use of airlines in the form of EEUs and ensure that these units are withdrawn from the Paris Agreement platform to avoid double counting.

But Thomsen notes that some countries lack the necessary resources or expertise to navigate the process. “IATA is doing its best to facilitate the process through workshops, and guidelines, and more hands-on assistance,” she says. “But we need to accelerate and increase the pipeline. We need to work out what projects are the closest to obtaining authorization and make that happen.”

IATA has established the Civil Aviation Decarbonization Organization (CADO) which operates the SAF Registry and IATA has itself launched the SAF Matchmaker. It is additionally offering EEUs for airlines to purchase on its Aviation Carbon Exchange platform.

“We can’t afford CORSIA, agreed to by all UN member States, to fall apart and have each State adopt its own individual system, because such fragmentation is incompatible with global international civil aviation,” says Thomsen. “CORSIA must be strong to ensure a cohesive policy framework. And it will most likely raise more money for participating countries than any air travel ticket tax they might be contemplating.”

Thomsen concludes that the WSS will highlight two essential features for net-zero success—a global, liquid, and transparent SAF market, and a global, liquid, and transparent carbon credit market. Regulators can make this a viable proposition, just as they can promote the other technologies and levers required to reach net zero air transportation in 2050.

“It is time to break the silos and work across disciplines, ministries, institutions, and industries,” she says. “Anything else won’t work. Coordinated strategies are essential for decarbonization because aviation is just one part of the broader energy transition. Reaching net zero CO2 emissions by 2050 in any industry depends on effective policies and investment.”

SAN FRANCISCO, CA, UNITED STATES, August 24, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- Energy America (EA), a USA-based solar module manufacturer and EPC contractor, together with Centauri, its advanced R&D arm, today announced their official entry into the Saudi Arabian renewable energy market. The companies have been granted an investment license from the Kingdom’s Ministry of Investment (MISA), enabling them to operate as a local entity and partner directly with Saudi stakeholders under the framework of Vision 2030.

This milestone unlocks Energy America’s ability to develop utility-scale solar photovoltaic (PV) power plants with integrated Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS), modernize Transmission & Distribution (T&D) networks, and explore the establishment of local solar module manufacturing facilities. These initiatives will strengthen Saudi Arabia’s renewable capacity while building local supply chains, creating jobs, and ensuring technology transfer to Saudi citizens.

U.S. Technology and Financing: A Strategic Advantage for Saudi Arabia

Energy America’s market entry reflects the growing demand for transparent, compliant, and secure renewable energy supply chains. Recent developments in U.S. policy — including the Trump Administration’s Section 232 investigation on polysilicon and FEOC (Foreign Entity of Concern) restrictions — are reshaping global solar supply, reinforcing the importance of American technology in international partnerships.

For Saudi Arabia, this means access to:

EXIM Bank financing support for large-scale solar and storage projects, providing long-term bankability and sovereign-level risk mitigation.

U.S. regulatory alignment, ensuring solar assets deployed in the Kingdom are free from trade-disruption risks and fully compliant with future global regulatory frameworks.

American-engineered solar modules, designed for reliability in extreme climates and developed with the highest standards of traceability, performance, and durability.

“Saudi Arabia’s bold renewable energy targets and pro-business environment under Vision 2030 make it an ideal place for our growth,” said Jack Stone, Chief Executive Officer of Energy America. “By bringing American technology, FEOC-compliant supply chains, and EXIM-backed financing into the Kingdom, we are ensuring that Saudi projects will not only succeed technically but remain secure from shifting trade and regulatory risks. This is the foundation for a durable U.S.–Saudi partnership in clean energy.”

Saudi Market Entry and Local Partnerships

With the Riyadh investment license secured, Energy America and Centauri will establish a regional headquarters in the coming weeks. The companies plan to collaborate closely with Saudi ministries, utilities, private developers, and supply chain partners to deliver:

Utility-scale solar PV and BESS projects supporting grid stability and round-the-clock clean energy.

Transmission & Distribution modernization, aligned with Saudi Arabia’s expanding electricity demand.

Local module manufacturing feasibility studies, designed to maximize domestic content and create a long-term, U.S.-aligned industrial base.

“Saudi Arabia’s strategic role in the Middle East’s energy transition cannot be overstated,” said Kevin Lumbert, Vice President for Saudi Arabia. “By establishing a permanent presence here, we will directly contribute to Vision 2030 — from solar farms and storage systems to advanced T&D infrastructure. More importantly, we are committed to engaging with local suppliers and training Saudi talent so that this transition creates sustainable jobs and knowledge transfer. With American technology and financing behind us, our projects will deliver lasting value for both Saudi Arabia and the wider region.”

Strengthening Vision 2030 Goals

Energy America’s expansion into Saudi Arabia is structured to:

Throughout the summer, NPR's Short Wave podcast has been bringing us the latest science from the depths of the ocean. And today, we travel to the sea floor, home to rare earth elements like cobalt, nickel and copper. These elements are used in everything from smartphones to electric cars to fighter jets.

WALTER SOGNNES: There is a reason why all countries and all nations - they have a critical minerals strategy. It's because the foundation for a green transition is all these different minerals.

RASCOE: That's Walter Sognnes, CEO of Glomar Minerals, a mining company based in the U.K. Companies like his and some countries, including the U.S., want to commercially mine the deep sea. But scientists are warning about the environmental impact. NPR's Emily Kwong has more.

EMILY KWONG, BYLINE: You may be wondering, why are there rare earth elements in the deep sea?

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""PART OF YOUR WORLD"")

JODI BENSON: (As Ariel, singing) Look at this trove, treasures untold. How many wonders can one cavern hold?

KWONG: It's not because a little mermaid is down there hoarding treasure. Rather, rare earth elements accumulate over millions of years in these potato-sized lumps called polymetallic nodules found on the sea floor. Matthias Haeckel, a marine geochemist at GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research Kiel in Germany, says these nodules are found in certain parts of the ocean and act as anchor points for all kinds of marine life.

MATTHIAS HAECKEL: I think the oldest nodule in the Pacific that has been dated was 14 million years old.

KWONG: In fact, the nodules grow at an average rate of tens of millimeters per million years through two main pathways - adsorption, which begins when a particle, like a fish bone or a shark tooth, falls to the ocean floor. And eventually, metals from the water column accumulate around that shark tooth, coating it with layers of metal. And the second way is diffusion. That's driven by microbes breaking down organic material.

Now, a lot of green technology is actually moving away from cobalt- and nickel-based batteries towards sodium-ion batteries or batteries made from renewable or recyclable material. But Sognnes maintains that the thirst for electric vehicles, wind turbines, weapons means that rare earth elements will have to come from somewhere and that the nodules in the ocean are a more reasonable place to get them.

SOGNNES: We believe that disturbance we are making in the ocean is a lesser effect than the mining in the rainforest, for instance.

KWONG: But what is the long-term damage to the ocean if these nodules are pulled up? Scientists have tried to predict that through experiments. One of the most significant is the European JPI Oceans project MiningImpact. A team led by Haeckel went to two places rich with nodules, the Clarion-Clipperton zone and the Peru Basin, where scientists in the '80s and '90s purposefully disturbed the sediment.

HAECKEL: To look how these experiment areas have evolved.

KWONG: Decades later, the sediment showed very little recovery.

HAECKEL: And the reason for that is that the energy flow into the deep sea is very low.

KWONG: Because less than 1% of marine snow or organic material falls into the deep sea, everything down there grows very, very slowly. So if mining were to ever happen and those nodules were removed, Haeckel says they would not come back any time soon.

HAECKEL: The specific fauna that needs these nodules for their life is gone permanently on our human timescales.

KWONG: These environments are fragile, and it's one of the reasons that 38 countries have called for a moratorium on deep-sea mining until scientists figure out the safest way to do it.

The Model S now has a base price of $94,990, while the Model X's base price is $99,990.
Earlier this year, a Tesla official said the company would make upgrades to the Model S and Model X.
Kelley Blue Book data shows that, in the second quarter of 2025, Tesla sold 1,435 Model S and 2,871 Model Xs.
""With the latest price change, the two models' fate seems sealed, with dwindling sales and lackluster hardware updates,"" InsideEVs speculated.","Tesla has quietly raised the prices for two of its oldest models, in a move some critics are describing as a ""last hurrah"" for the vehicles.

What's happening?

In mid-August, prices for Tesla's Model S and Model X both increased by $10,000, InsideEVs reports.

The price increase does come with several additional features, which Tesla refers to as the ""Luxe Package."" That package, which is now a mandatory feature on the two models, includes Tesla's autonomous driving package, known as Full Self-Driving, free Supercharging, and a four-year service plan, among other features.

Previously, FSD alone was priced at $8,000 for each model, but it was available as an optional add-on, not a mandatory feature. And even when using FSD, drivers must still control the car and remain focused on the road at all times.

This is the second price hike this year on both models, following a $5,000 increase in June. The Model S now has a base price of $94,990, while the Model X's base price is $99,990.

Earlier this year, a Tesla official said the company would make upgrades to the Model S and Model X.

Why are these increases important?

The price hikes come at a time when Tesla has seen sales dwindle, especially for these two models.

Kelley Blue Book data shows that, in the second quarter of 2025, Tesla sold 1,435 Model S and 2,871 Model Xs. For both models, that was a drop of at least 56% from the previous year. Overall, Tesla sales fell by 12.6% year-over-year.

Adding features to the Model S and Model X may make those cars more appealing to some would-be buyers, but the higher price tag is also likely to push some away. And some believe it could mark the end of these longtime Tesla stalwarts.

""With the latest price change, the two models' fate seems sealed, with dwindling sales and lackluster hardware updates,"" InsideEVs speculated.

What can I do about this?

Tesla remains the biggest all-electric vehicle company, so it's fair to worry that any dip in its sales, or any price increases, could lead to fewer EVs on the road. And the fewer EVs there are, the more pollution is created by gas-powered cars that rely on dirty fuel.

Hydrogen is widely recognized as a clean energy source, and research suggests it may contribute to areas such as cell therapy and other medical applications.","The traditional Japanese spirit of monozukuri is defined by a deep commitment to craftsmanship, precision, and continuous improvement throughout every stage of the manufacturing process. How does your company embody the principles of monozukuri?

My father founded the company 67 years ago as a small manufacturer of manual LPG pumps, and we’ve been in the LP gas vaporizer business for about 60 years now. In the early days, we also offered plant engineering services, and through those operations, we came to realize the need for a vaporizer.

Over time, we developed a variety of products to meet our customers’ needs, including burners and LPG vaporizers. We’ve produced many types of vaporizers—some powered by electricity, others by hot water or steam. As we worked through these developments, we went through a process of trial and error. That journey allowed us to build valuable knowledge and expertise, which now informs every aspect of our manufacturing, design, and quality control. This is the foundation of our strength and our ongoing commitment to monozukuri.

Your products serve a wide range of industries and applications, including gas conversion, cooling, and fertilizers. Could you tell us more about your main customer segments and how your products are used in these areas? What do you think makes customers choose your company over others?

First, I want to emphasize that we don’t typically sell our products directly to end users in Japan. Most of our sales are through gas companies, construction firms, and distributors. These partners have their own product lines and work directly with the end users.

As for applications, our products are commonly used in facilities that consume gas, such as factories, hotels, restaurants, and hospitals. Among these, factories represent the largest share. For example, we supply vaporizers to steel and glass factories that operate large boilers. We also serve many automobile factories, which rely heavily on gas in their operations.

Your company has carved out a niche in the industry by offering customization and flexibility, rather than providing a one-size-fits-all solution. Could you tell us more about how you approach customization and how it applies across different industries or customer needs?

We offer both standard and customized products. For our standard items, we maintain a production schedule and keep a certain level of inventory so we can respond quickly and deliver with short lead times.

For customized products, the process typically begins when we receive an inquiry from a customer. We then pass that request to our technical team to assess whether the specifications are feasible. If they determine it is, they work with the sales team to prepare a quotation for the customer.

Once the customer places an order, we issue instructions to the factory to begin production. As you might expect, this process takes time—usually around two to three months.

We handle a large number of custom orders, and often these are based on designs we’ve developed previously. In such cases, we refer to our data archives and adapt or refine those earlier designs, rather than starting from scratch. This allows us to be more efficient and responsive. I believe this is something that sets us apart. Many other companies avoid this kind of niche customization, either because it’s too specialized or because the market is too small for a larger firm to focus on. For us, though, it’s a meaningful and growing segment, and one where we’ve built a strong reputation.

Many countries, particularly across Asia and other emerging markets, are working to phase out coal and oil. In this transition, LPG and LNG are increasingly being adopted as cleaner, more flexible alternatives. These fuels are also seen as enabling modular and decentralized energy systems that can enhance disaster resilience and energy security. How do you see the role of LPG and LNG systems in supporting the global shift toward a more flexible and sustainable energy infrastructure?

As you mentioned, there is a global shift toward cleaner energy, but many developed countries still rely heavily on coal and other high-emission fuels. This dependence contributes to issues like deforestation and air pollution, which in turn can lead to serious health problems. Compared to those energy sources, LPG and LNG are significantly more environmentally friendly. That’s why they are increasingly valued as alternative fuels.

One of the key advantages of LPG is its versatility. While it’s typically stored in large tanks, it can also be distributed in smaller, portable containers. This makes it especially useful for remote areas where access to other energy sources may be limited.

One of your notable developments is the DX system—a line of dry electric vaporizers designed specifically for overseas markets, offering solutions for space constraints and cost efficiency. Could you share some of the technical considerations that shaped the design of these products with international markets in mind?

A key feature of the DX product is that it operates without using any water. This is one of its defining characteristics, especially when compared to other vaporizers that rely on hot water for operation.

I was directly involved in the development of the DX product, and one of the biggest challenges we faced was related to temperature control. With hot water systems, the temperature rises and falls gradually. But with aluminum, the temperature can increase or decrease much more rapidly. That difference created a number of technical hurdles.

For instance, when the temperature rises too high, the system is designed to shut off automatically through a safety switch. During development, we experienced some malfunctions with that switch, which was something we had to address very carefully. Inside the aluminum structure, we installed temperature sensors, but the biggest issue we encountered was how to position the coil component, which is embedded in the center. If the coil is not aligned precisely, it can lead to malfunctions. Achieving perfect alignment during production was extremely difficult.

We went through a lot of trial and error, but eventually we found a solution. Today, we’re proud to say that we sell a large number of these vaporizers around the world, and they’ve become especially popular in Africa.

What do you believe are the key factors behind the success of this product in overseas markets, and particularly in Africa?

We originally developed this type of vaporizer in response to a specific customer request. The customer wanted a unit that didn’t require water because they planned to use it in street food carts in Singapore. Their intention was to mount the device on a wall or shelf rather than placing it on the ground. In that setup, it would be difficult to refill water regularly, which is why they needed a water-free solution.

Additionally, because space is so limited in Singapore, there are strict regulations for street food carts. A traditional vaporizer simply wouldn’t fit. That’s why we designed a more compact unit that could be installed in elevated spaces.

While many of our overseas customers may not face the exact same restrictions, I think the features that made the product suitable for that original use case—compact size, no water requirement, and flexible installation—are widely appreciated in other markets as well.

Turning to your overseas strategy, we understand you have two subsidiaries in Shanghai as well as a global distribution network. Could you tell us which markets or regions you are currently focusing on for further growth?

Right now, our priority markets are the Philippines in Southeast Asia and the Middle East, as these two regions account for the majority of our overseas revenue. In addition to that, we’re collaborating with the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) to install one of our units in Tanzania as a trial or proof of concept. Most households in Tanzania still rely on wood for cooking, and President Samia Suluhu Hassan has introduced a green cooking policy aimed at shifting from wood to cleaner energy sources such as LPG.

With that in mind, we applied to JICA’s program, which supports small and medium-sized enterprises like ours that may not have the resources to expand overseas independently, particularly in markets like Africa. JICA provides financial and logistical support to help companies like us develop opportunities in emerging regions.

For this project, we proposed our unique BAiO product, which is a tank with a built-in vaporizer. Typically, the tank, vaporizer, and related components are separate, but this unit integrates everything into one system. It can be installed easily by simply connecting a pipe, and it is also much easier to maintain. This kind of compact, all-in-one solution is particularly valuable in developing countries where safety standards and regulatory frameworks may not be as strict. The BAiO system offers both simplicity and enhanced safety, which we see as a strong advantage in these markets.

In addition to your collaboration with JICA, you also maintain a global distribution network. As you continue expanding internationally, are you actively seeking new partnerships? If so, what types of partners are you looking for?

When we enter new markets with partners, it’s essential that those partners have a strong understanding of the local market. They must also place a high priority on quality, and most importantly, they need to be reliable and trustworthy.

One of our key criteria is a potential partner’s technical and sales capability. They need to fully understand our products and have strong technical expertise, along with a well-developed sales network. It’s also crucial that they are knowledgeable about local regulations and have a solid track record of compliance. Any required certifications must be in place, and their organizational structure should be responsive and efficient.

Another important factor is the mindset and behavior of the partner. To build a long-term relationship, they must demonstrate a clear willingness to provide maintenance and after-sales service. That kind of customer support is critical to us. Corporate values are equally important. As a Japanese company, we put a strict emphasis on quality, and we need our partners to understand and share that philosophy. Before moving forward with any new partnership, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation to ensure we can grow the market together effectively.

One interesting area of diversification is your Doctors Man product line, which focuses on hydrogen-based healthcare solutions. What was the strategic thinking behind entering this new market, and how do you see it complementing your core business?

We occasionally use hydrogen in our core business, but we also see significant potential in the healthcare sector. Hydrogen is widely recognized as a clean energy source, and research suggests it may contribute to areas such as cell therapy and other medical applications. With ongoing advancements in hydrogen-related research, we believe there is strong potential for commercialization in the healthcare field as well.

As a company, we are working to diversify our business portfolio, and this new venture is being led by our overseas sales and development team. We launched the Doctors Man project about six years ago, and it has become a pioneering company in the field of hydrogen-based healthcare products.

We serve as the exclusive distributor for Doctors Man, leveraging our technical expertise, industry knowledge, and international distribution network. Currently, we are offering hydrogen water generators and hydrogen gas inhalers as part of the product lineup.

So the product wasn’t originally developed in-house. Is this part of a development partnership, or are you strictly acting as a distributor?

We are solely the overseas distributor. They already have a strong domestic sales network in Japan, but since they are a small company like us, they don’t have an overseas presence. That’s why we approached them with the idea of working together. It turned out to be a good match.

Your company was founded in 1958, which means you’ll celebrate your 75th anniversary in 2033. Looking ahead, where do you envision the company by that milestone?

I haven’t looked that far ahead in detail, but at the moment, our annual sales are around JPY 4 billion. We've recently put together a five-year management plan with the goal of increasing that figure to JPY 6 billion.

If you're asking where we want to be by 2033, our target is to reach JPY 10 billion in sales. To achieve that, our overseas business development team will need to play a much larger role. They must become a core pillar of the company. By that time, we expect at least JPY 2 billion in sales to come from international markets.",https://www.theworldfolio.com/img_db/interviews/interview-689f42447a8f4.jpg,N,,2025-08-24 23:00:07.176110

The new strategy developed by the Queensland Renewable Energy Council shows more than 140 gigawatts of energy projects proposed in Queensland’s broader renewables pipeline[1], including almost 8GW of renewable generation and storage projects financially committed-to or already under construction, valued at more than $10.7 billion.

Much of it is located in, or targeted at regional or rural areas of the state.

If fully developed, 140 GW of renewable energy projects could power around 222 million homes – or every home in Queensland for more than a century, QREC says.

QREC chief executive officer Katie-Anne Mulder said Queensland Renewables Growth and Investment Strategy provided the clarity and stability required to give investors confidence, while ensuring communities remain at the centre of the energy transformation.

“Queenslanders have known about the importance of renewable energy for decades; whether it has been the Southern Cross windmills to pump water on farms, bagasse from our sugar mills, or solar panels on the rooves of more than half of Queensland homes,” she said.

“On a larger scale, renewable energy offers much more for Queensland. Already, almost 30pc of Queensland energy is generated from renewable energy,” she said.

“Queensland has the strongest renewable pipeline in Australia. But to turn projects into jobs, infrastructure and investment, we need clear, market-led strategies that give certainty to industry, communities, and investors.”

Ms Mulder said QREC was releasing the strategy to complement the Queensland Government’s work to develop its Energy Roadmap – expected to be released by the end of this year.

“This Strategy is the rubber hitting the Roadmap,” she said. “It’s the ‘how’ behind Queensland achieving economically-efficient emissions reduction.”

Flood of private capital for renewables projects

Last month, state treasurer and energy minister David Janetzki told a Budget Estimates hearing that his government wanted to see a flood of private capital coming toward renewables in Queensland.

“Queensland’s renewable energy story is not new. But the new chapters are to be written now. We must act now,” he said.

“This strategy provides a balanced plan that supports investment certainty, empowers regional communities, and ensures a reliable energy system for generations to come.”

Ms Mulder said the strategy would help secure the private capital Queensland needs, underpinned by three key pillars:

refocusing the energy system for long-term reliability and affordability,

partnering with regional Queensland for a coordinated, value-driven transition, and

creating a world-class development framework.

Recommendations

Fifteen recommendations are set out in the roadmap for Queensland to deliver affordable, reliable and sustainable energy, while ensuring regional communities share in the benefits, Ms Mulder said.

They include:

Refocusing the Energy System for Long-Term Reliability and Affordability

Developing a state government investment prospectus with clear milestones for coal retirements and clarity on the role of government-owned corporations.

Redefining Renewable Energy Zones (REZs) as transmission coordination tools, with published timeframes and recognition of Readiness Assessments as social impact approvals.

Establishing a state-level plan for end-of-life solar panels, including regional recycling hubs and early funding incentives.

Providing targeted support for pumped hydro, with proactive site identification and a government–industry partnership model.

Partnering with Regional Queensland for a Coordinated, Value-Driven Transition

Adapting the Developer and Investor Toolkit into a mandatory landholder Code of Conduct.

Delivering an Integrated Energy and Agriculture Action Plan.

Strengthening First Nations participation, embedding the Commonwealth’s First Nations Clean Energy Strategy, funding capability programs, and reviving Queensland’s Remote and First Nations Energy Strategy.

Standardising Community Benefit Agreements (CBAs) with per-MW annual contributions or fixed negotiated models.

Exploring a centralised pooled community benefit fund for long-term regional priorities.

Creating a World-Class Development Framework to Unlock the Next Wave of Investment

Expanding the Resources Cabinet Committee to cover energy, ensuring whole-of-government coordination

Amending the Planning Act 2016 (Qld) to allow the Energy Minister to step in on projects critical to state objectives

Streamlining approvals with an updated Commonwealth–Queensland bilateral agreement, published timeframes, and technology-specific processes.

Developing fit-for-purpose mapping systems, including OSOM transport corridors and an energy project portal in GeoResGlobe.

Establishing a Queensland Wind Farm Transportation Group to implement logistics recommendations.

Creating a statewide decommissioning and financial security framework, led by Queensland Treasury, to cover all technologies fairly across their lifecycle.

In a revelation that could reshape America’s approach to securing vital resources, a new analysis published in the journal Science indicates that the United States is already extracting all the critical minerals it requires for energy, defense, and technology sectors—but discarding them as waste. According to the study, minerals like cobalt, lithium, and rare earth elements are present in the tailings and byproducts of existing mining operations across the country. This oversight represents a missed opportunity to bolster domestic supply chains without the need for new mines, potentially alleviating geopolitical tensions over resource dependency.

The research, led by experts from the Colorado School of Mines and detailed in a report shared via Phys.org, quantifies the scale of this waste. Annually, U.S. mines produce enough discarded lithium to power 10 million electric vehicles, alongside substantial quantities of other essential materials. This comes at a time when demand for these minerals is surging due to the transition to renewable energy and advanced manufacturing.

Quantifying the Losses

Industry insiders have long suspected inefficiencies in mineral extraction, but this analysis provides concrete data. By examining waste streams from coal, copper, and other traditional mining sites, the study reveals that recovery technologies could capture these minerals economically. For instance, tailings from copper mines often contain cobalt, a key component in batteries, which is currently being dumped rather than processed.

Further insights from Grist highlight that the U.S. discards vast quantities of manganese and other elements critical for steel production and electronics. The economic implications are profound: recycling these waste streams could reduce reliance on imports from China, which dominates global refining capacity for many of these minerals, as noted in a Council on Foreign Relations overview.

Policy and Technological Implications

The findings align with recent government initiatives, such as the Department of the Interior’s efforts to recover critical minerals from mine waste, announced in July 2025. This push, detailed on the U.S. Department of the Interior’s website, aims to integrate advanced separation techniques into existing operations, potentially unlocking billions in value.

However, challenges remain. Mining companies must invest in new processing infrastructure, and regulatory hurdles could slow adoption. As Mining Technology reports, the initiative seeks to address national defense needs by tapping into domestic sources, reducing vulnerabilities exposed by global supply chain disruptions.

Geopolitical Ramifications

On the international front, this domestic potential contrasts with U.S. efforts to secure minerals abroad, such as deals in Africa and Ukraine, as covered by Reuters. By focusing inward, America could diminish China’s leverage in the critical minerals market, where Beijing controls much of the processing.

Experts argue that incentivizing waste recovery through tax credits or subsidies, similar to those in the Inflation Reduction Act, could accelerate progress. The analysis in Science underscores that with targeted investments, the U.S. could achieve self-sufficiency in critical minerals within years, transforming waste into a strategic asset.

Future Prospects and Industry Shifts

For mining executives and policymakers, the message is clear: innovation in extraction isn’t just about digging deeper but smarter. Companies like those profiled in Mother Jones are already exploring pilot projects to extract lithium from coal ash, demonstrating feasibility.

Ultimately, this shift could redefine the sector, promoting sustainability while enhancing security. As demand for electric vehicles and renewable tech grows, harnessing mine waste offers a pragmatic path forward, ensuring the U.S. doesn’t continue throwing away its future.",https://www.webpronews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/xai-tmp-imgen-9e66499a-49aa-4aac-94b5-4e489f266976.jpeg,N,,2025-08-24 20:59:12.853148

Throughout the summer, NPR's Short Wave podcast has been bringing us the latest science from the depths of the ocean. And today, we travel to the sea floor, home to rare earth elements like cobalt, nickel and copper. These elements are used in everything from smartphones to electric cars to fighter jets.

WALTER SOGNNES: There is a reason why all countries and all nations - they have a critical minerals strategy. It's because the foundation for a green transition is all these different minerals.

RASCOE: That's Walter Sognnes, CEO of Glomar Minerals, a mining company based in the U.K. Companies like his and some countries, including the U.S., want to commercially mine the deep sea. But scientists are warning about the environmental impact. NPR's Emily Kwong has more.

EMILY KWONG, BYLINE: You may be wondering, why are there rare earth elements in the deep sea?

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""PART OF YOUR WORLD"")

JODI BENSON: (As Ariel, singing) Look at this trove, treasures untold. How many wonders can one cavern hold?

KWONG: It's not because a little mermaid is down there hoarding treasure. Rather, rare earth elements accumulate over millions of years in these potato-sized lumps called polymetallic nodules found on the sea floor. Matthias Haeckel, a marine geochemist at GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research Kiel in Germany, says these nodules are found in certain parts of the ocean and act as anchor points for all kinds of marine life.

MATTHIAS HAECKEL: I think the oldest nodule in the Pacific that has been dated was 14 million years old.

KWONG: In fact, the nodules grow at an average rate of tens of millimeters per million years through two main pathways - adsorption, which begins when a particle, like a fish bone or a shark tooth, falls to the ocean floor. And eventually, metals from the water column accumulate around that shark tooth, coating it with layers of metal. And the second way is diffusion. That's driven by microbes breaking down organic material.

Now, a lot of green technology is actually moving away from cobalt- and nickel-based batteries towards sodium-ion batteries or batteries made from renewable or recyclable material. But Sognnes maintains that the thirst for electric vehicles, wind turbines, weapons means that rare earth elements will have to come from somewhere and that the nodules in the ocean are a more reasonable place to get them.

SOGNNES: We believe that disturbance we are making in the ocean is a lesser effect than the mining in the rainforest, for instance.

KWONG: But what is the long-term damage to the ocean if these nodules are pulled up? Scientists have tried to predict that through experiments. One of the most significant is the European JPI Oceans project MiningImpact. A team led by Haeckel went to two places rich with nodules, the Clarion-Clipperton zone and the Peru Basin, where scientists in the '80s and '90s purposefully disturbed the sediment.

HAECKEL: To look how these experiment areas have evolved.

KWONG: Decades later, the sediment showed very little recovery.

HAECKEL: And the reason for that is that the energy flow into the deep sea is very low.

KWONG: Because less than 1% of marine snow or organic material falls into the deep sea, everything down there grows very, very slowly. So if mining were to ever happen and those nodules were removed, Haeckel says they would not come back any time soon.

HAECKEL: The specific fauna that needs these nodules for their life is gone permanently on our human timescales.

KWONG: These environments are fragile, and it's one of the reasons that 38 countries have called for a moratorium on deep-sea mining until scientists figure out the safest way to do it.

CleanTechnica readers will be familiar with Our Children’s Trust, a public interest law firm that specializes in bringing legal challenges on behalf of young clients. Dr. James Hansen, the noted NASA scientist who first testified in front of the US Congress about the connection between carbon dioxide and a warming, has been a vocal advocate for the group’s work.

In fact, his granddaughter was one of the young plaintiffs in the groundbreaking case of Juliana Vs. US, which sought to obtain a ruling that the federal government has a duty to protect the lives and health of its citizens, a position that is bitterly opposed by the fossil fuel industry.

Our Children’s Trust did achieve a milestone victory in Montana recently. Section 1 of Article IX of the Montana constitution says specifically:

The state and each person shall maintain and improve a clean and healthful environment in Montana for present and future generations.

The legislature shall provide for the administration and enforcement of this duty.

The legislature shall provide adequate remedies for the protection of the environmental life support system from degradation and provide adequate remedies to prevent unreasonable depletion and degradation of natural resources.

The Montana Supreme Court has now ruled that section means precisely what it says and has invalidated laws passed by the state’s legislature that were designed to limit the application of Article IX.

Wisconsin Lawsuit Challenges PSC Rules

Now Our Children’s Trust has teamed up with an environmental law firm in Wisconsin called Midwest Environmental Advocates to represent a group of 15 young Wisconsin residents in a legal action that seeks to invalidate two state statutes. They claim those statures unfairly benefit fossil fuel powered thermal electricity generation and limit the amount of renewable energy available within the state.

In addition, the lawsuit alleges the continued use of fossil fuels in energy generation is harming their young plaintiffs’ basic constitutional rights and creating an unstable future for them. The case was filed on August 22 against the Public Service Commission and the state legislature.

“The science around how climate change is going to affect Wisconsin is clear. It’s affecting us now. It’s only going to get worse, and it will get worse if Wisconsin keeps pumping greenhouse gases into the atmosphere,” Tony Wilkin-Gibart, the executive director of MEA and one of the lawyers for the case, told the press.

“We believe that (their constitutional rights are) being violated by the state continuing to pump greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere and drive the climate crisis in ways that are harming our clients and profoundly disrupting their ways of life and jeopardizing the stability of their future,” Wilkin Gibart said, according to a report by Wisconsin Public Radio.

“Our clients are asking the court to uphold their right to a livable future,” he said. “This case is about whether they will inherit a future shaped by clean energy and a stable climate — or one burdened by fossil fuel pollution, extreme weather events, and growing threats to their health and safety.”

Favoring Fossil Fuels

Specifically, one Wisconsin law today prevents the state’s public service commission from considering toxic and planet-heating air pollution when considering permits for new fossil fuel power plants, while another bars the PSC from requiring utilities to increase the amount of electricity they obtain from carbon-free sources.

“These laws set up a system where the public service commission continues to approve fossil fuel power plants and cannot bring online more renewable energy,” Nate Bellinger, supervising staff attorney at Our Children’s Trust, told The Guardian. Wisconsin has pledged to transition to 100 percent carbon-free electricity by 2050, but those laws are diametrically opposed to implementing that policy initiative.

“The state legislature and the executive branch have both set goals and mandates to decarbonize the electricity sector,” said Bellinger. “These laws are getting in the way of that.” He claimed the laws in Wisconsin are ripe for a challenge. “The case is really a challenge to the electricity sector in Wisconsin, which is still predominantly powered by fossil fuels, and there’s a lot of opportunity there to transition that to renewables,” he said.

The lawsuit criticizes the PSC for not requiring utilities to invest more than 10% in renewable energy and points to policies in Wisconsin that give fossil fuels like coal and natural gas an edge when it comes to choosing and developing new power plants. Fossil fuels provide about 75 percent of Wisconsin’s electricity today.

“The trends that we’re seeing in Wisconsin are so profound, and the impacts of climate change are affecting Wisconsinites right now,” Wilkin-Gibart said. “We’re on track for a record number of smoke-filled days this summer. This entire summer has been marked by thoughts and anxiety about whether young people, and frankly any Wisconsinites, can go out and exercise and spend time with family.”

Health Risks

The complaint claims the young plaintiffs are exposed to a greater incidence of health risks, including asthma and respiratory illnesses made worse by increases in average temperatures and air pollution, flooding of their homes and communities, and mental health trauma tied to ecological loss and extreme weather events. Perhaps the latest study that shows climate-related pollution contributes to over 90,000 premature deaths in the US each year will bolster their case.

“We’re in a situation here in the state where we have state laws that tell our Public Service Commission to completely ignore these climate impacts, to completely ignore what our clients are experiencing, and to completely ignore the fate of these young people and future generations,” Wilkin-Gibart said.

Ted Schultz-Becker is one of the young plaintiffs. He said in a press release reported by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that the lawsuit represents a chance to have the voices of Wisconsin youth heard. “These laws force my government to ignore science and pollution. That’s wrong and unconstitutional. Young people have power, even when we can’t vote. Our voices matter, and we trust our Constitution and courts to protect us.”

The attorneys are asking a judge to strike down state laws that limit consideration of climate effects and cap renewable energy requirements when regulators determine whether to approve or deny new projects. They want a judge to rule the laws violate their clients’ constitutional rights and find that the Public Service Commission and Legislature have a duty to protect the health and welfare of the young plaintiffs.

Republican Pushback

The lawsuit is likely to face opposition from the Republican-controlled Legislature and its top leaders. Wisconsin Assembly Speaker Robin Vos is on record as saying that climate change “probably” is real. Wisconsin Democrats have repeatedly introduced a package of bills to combat climate change and shift to clean energy, but Vos has said such efforts are only “pandering to the very liberal base.” Senate Majority Leader Devin LeMahieu has said such legislation would only “triple down on the ‘Green New Deal’ disaster.”

Republican lawmakers have also promoted legislation that would prevent state and local governments from enacting mandates that favor electric vehicles or restrict the use of propane or methane stoves, claiming they want to protect consumer choices. Governor Tony Evers vetoed those bills because he said they would limit the state’s ability to combat climate change.

If the latest lawsuit is successful, it will spark a torrent of backlash from Republicans in Wisconsin. In the event they follow the example set by so-called leaders at the national level, they may simply choose to ignore any court decision.

For years, sales of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), which can burn fuel or run off a battery, have been tipped to fall as full-battery electric vehicles (BEVs) take their place.

But in Australia, another story is unfolding.

PHEV sales are booming.

One year ago, not a single PHEV ute had been sold anywhere in Australia.

Today, there are more than 12,000 on our roads, and a PHEV is the fourth best-selling ute in the country.

To some, PHEVs are a necessary ""stepping stone"" in the process of vehicle electrification, helping Australians get used to battery-powered cars.

But others argue PHEVs simply prolong our costly love affair with unnecessarily large cars.

These hybrids, they say, are effectively gas guzzlers dressed up as EVs, or ""wolves in sheep's clothing"".

So why are Australians reluctant to drop the fuel tank entirely, and what does it mean for reducing emissions?

Hybrid EVs versus full-battery EVs

The phrase electric vehicle (EV) may conjure images of 100 per cent battery-powered cars, but many EVs regularly burn fossil fuels.

And these cars make up an increasing proportion of the EV market.

Plug-in hybrids or PHEVs combine an internal combustion engine (like petrol or diesel) with an electric motor and a battery pack that can be charged from an external power source.

They generally emit less CO2 than equivalent-model full-combustion vehicles, but significantly more than BEVs, when used over an extended period of time.

This is because PHEV batteries are relatively small and, when they're empty, drivers tend to run the car on fossil fuels before recharging.

Plug-in hybrids now about a quarter of EVs sold

In two years, PHEVs have gone from about a tenth of total EV sales to about a quarter.

The rise of PHEVs is making the story of the electrification of transport in Australia more complicated.

You may have heard that EVs are accounting for a larger proportion of new car sales.

While this is true, a lot of the recent increase is due to PHEVs.

BEV sales, as a proportion of new car sales, have actually plateaued at less than 9 per cent over the past two years.

But PHEVs recently shot from 1 per cent to 5 per cent of sales in less than a year.

What's causing this deceleration is contested.

Globally, the pace of growth of EV sales outside of China has slowed, with EV market share in the US and Europe stagnating.

One theory is the BEV industry faces a challenge reaching customers beyond the ""early adopters"", partly due to concerns about charging infrastructure.

Another theory is the arrival of PHEVs has effectively siphoned sales from BEVs.

In Europe and the US, like in Australia, PHEV sales are booming.

Are plug-in hybrids helping or hindering fully electric car sales?

The popularity of PHEVs has defied predictions.

""Amongst the EV community we're a little surprised,"" Ben Elliston, chair of the ACT branch of the Australian Electric Vehicle Association (AEVA), says.

""PHEVs came out of nowhere in the last few years.

""It seemed clear to us that BEVs are the better technology but the mainstream buyer seems to have different ideas.""

Chris Jones, president of the AEVA, says PHEVs are undermining Australia's emission reduction goals.

But others in the automotive industry have a very different take.

They say PHEVs are cracking a consumer segment that isn't yet ready to go all-electric.

""They're a real stepping stone for people to ultimately move into a battery electric vehicle, but are not yet prepared to take that step,"" Rohan Martin, CEO of the National Automotive Leasing and Salary Packaging Association (NALSPA), says.

Aman Gaur, head of legal policy and advocacy at the Electric Vehicle Council, said many Australians wanted to buy big, powerful cars like SUV and utes.

PHEVs are meeting demand currently unserved by BEVs, he says, noting that some vehicle electrification is better than none.

""We don’t live in the kind of country where we tell people what car to buy,"" he says.

Mike Costello, an analyst for automotive research firm Manheim Australia, says ""PHEVs are competing for the middle ground"", not just ""the so-called early adopters"".

""The BYD Shark ute for, example isn't just preaching to the converted, it’s pulling people out of [full combustion] four-wheel drives.

""There's little doubt some people would have traded in [Toyota] Hiluxes and [Ford] Rangers [for Sharks].""

Who's buying PHEVs?

Michael Formosa, whose company services and repairs garage doors and gates in Sydney, traded in four Ford Ranger diesel utes for four PHEV utes in December last year.

Other than a few issues with battery range when towing, he's happy with the decision, which has meant spending less on fuel.

""I worked out we're doing about an eighth [of our travelling] in petrol and the rest in [battery power],"" he says.

Utes account for about 20 per cent of all vehicles sold in Australia, making them a big chunk of the market.

The only BEV or fully-electric ute available in Australia, the LDV eT60, has had well-documented performance problems, and is a third more expensive than popular PHEV models. Eight have been sold in Australia so far this year.

""There isn't yet a fit-for-purpose BEV for light commercial vehicles,"" Mace Hartley, executive director of Australasian Fleet Management Association, says.

PHEVs, meanwhile, now account for more than 7 per cent of sales in the ute market.

This suggests tradies like Michael are buying PHEVs instead of petrol or diesel utes, and not instead of BEVs.

But utes aren't the only kind of PHEV selling well.

About half of PHEVs sold in 2025 were small or medium-size SUVs, a vehicle class that, unlike utes, includes lots of popular BEVs.

Here, it's harder to argue PHEVs are serving a demand unmet by BEVs.

A 2024 NALSPA survey found that, compared to BEV owners, a relatively high proportion of PHEV drivers lived in outer suburbs or were based in regional areas.

Many weren't yet ready for a BEV due to range anxiety, but would consider one as their next car.

""If you're charging a PHEV at home each night, you can run it as a pure electric vehicle and not have range concerns,"" NALSPA's Rohan Martin says.

But the AEVA's Chris Jones says Australians are simply buying what dealerships are stocking and promoting.

""We've become hooked on these large and somewhat unnecessary vehicles,"" he says.

""Dealers will claim that's what people want, but when you walk into a dealership you see a wall of PHEVs ... and the BEVs are harder to find.""

Are PHEVs good or bad news for emissions?

When burning fuel rather than running on battery power, PHEVs (which carry heavy batteries) actually emit more than their full-combustion equivalents.

They're only low-emission options if drivers plug them in to recharge.

This means if they're not being recharged, more PHEVs could amount to more higher-polluting cars on our roads.

A recent study from Europe, using onboard fuel-consumption data, found many PHEV drivers often don't recharge.

As a result, PHEVs may not be as clean as their rated emissions suggest (these ratings are based on the assumption drivers charge more often).

Based on the study's results, PHEVs may only be about half as polluting as their full-combustion equivalents.

That's good, but only as good as a standard hybrid (a vehicle with an onboard battery that can't be plugged in to charge).

""They're not going to decarbonise transport like we need them to,"" Mr Jones says.

Modelling of the EV uptake required to meet Australia's Paris Agreement emissions reduction commitment assumes PHEVs will account for 4–5 per cent of new car sales by 2030.

That's roughly where PHEV sales are now, but the long-term trend appears to be upwards.

Are plug-in hybrids the future or a temporary convenience?

Earlier this year, the federal government lifted a key tax exemption for PHEVs, effectively making them more expensive to own through a novated lease.

""The prevailing sense within the industry was the lifting of the [tax] exemption would stall PHEV sales, but this hasn’t happened,"" Manheim Australia's Mike Costello says.

""They’ve slowed but not stalled.”

Rather than shifting away from plug-ins, automotive brands are launching more PHEV models in the Australian market.

The Toyota RAV4, a top-selling medium SUV, will come with a PHEV option from 2026.

BYD, meanwhile, will launch a mix of four to five new PHEV and BEV models in Australia over the next six months, the company's chief operating officer Stephen Collins says.

The future of PHEVs partly depends on whether car companies can build a BEV ute that Australians want to buy.

If they do, the rise of PHEVs may be just a flash in the pan.

According to Mace Hartley from Australasian Fleet Management Association, Australia is ""18 months away from having BEV equivalents of the BYD Shark"".

Aman Gaur from the EV Council says improving battery technology means BEVs are the future, but plug-ins have a crucial role to play in the present.

""What we need is incentives to help people get into PHEV vehicles. We don't have any at the moment,"" he says.

""How are we getting people off petrol utes and into electrified utes?""

BYD's Stephen Collins says ""there's a place for plug-in hybrids in Australia over the next three to five years"".

""If we're looking at 10-years plus, maybe it's a different story.""

Batteries may be the future of transport, but the road to electrification is a twisty one.

And the upstart plug-in is showing no sign of going away.",https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/77bf98d97ab1db9efa4178b88a758f99?impolicy=wcms_watermark_news&cropH=2288&cropW=4068&xPos=613&yPos=528&width=862&height=485&imformat=generic,N,,2025-08-24 21:00:01.734871

Further reform and incentives are needed to transition into scaling down coal power generation and planning a coal exit strategy: in H1 2025, only 1 GW of coal power was retired.

Current dispatch practices predominantly rely on coal power plants for ramping up power generation when needed, with minimal incentives or explicit requirements to flexibly scale down power generation.
Policy recommendations To align China’s power system with its dual carbon goals and avoid locking in unnecessary coal power capacity, we recommend the following actions:","The Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA) and Global Energy Monitor (GEM) have released their H1 2025 biannual review of China’s coal projects, which finds that coal power additions are continuing to grow.

Although there were some signs of coal power slowing down in 2024 and 2025 has seen China’s clean energy boom meet a significant amount of power demand growth and lower CO2 emissions, coal power remains strong, with new and revived projects the highest in a decade.

In H1 2025, 21 gigawatts (GW) of coal power were commissioned, the highest amount in the first half of the year since 2016, with projections for the full year exceeding 80 GW. This increase in commissions follows on the tail of the 2022-2023 coal power permitting surge that saw two new coal projects permitted per week, on average, totalling more than 100 GW of coal power approved per year. This trend will likely continue into 2026 and 2027, unless policy action is taken.

Only 25 GW were permitted in H1 2025, yet new and revived projects came to 75 GW in H1 2025, the highest in a decade, and construction starts and restarts reached 46 GW, equivalent to the entire coal power capacity of South Korea.

This rush of activity signals possible pressure from the industry to expand coal projects as a last ditch effort before China’s 2030 carbon peaking deadline, right when strategic phase-down should be the priority to meet climate goals and as clean energy is meeting all of new power demand growth.

In June 2025, coal’s share in power generation dropped to a nine-year low of 51%, and only made up 34% of China’s total installed capacity, while renewables accounted for 60%, pointing to the ongoing trend of coal losing steam while an artificial push attempts to expand rather than phase down its historic role.

Although China pledged in 2022 that coal should play a flexible, supporting role while renewables are integrated, this policy has yet to be implemented in any meaningful way. Further reform and incentives are needed to transition into scaling down coal power generation and planning a coal exit strategy: in H1 2025, only 1 GW of coal power was retired. 13 GW need to be retired by the end of 2025 to meet the 14th Five-Year Plan goal of retiring 30 GW by the end of 2025.

With the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and 15th Five-Year Plan on the horizon, China has a critical opportunity to set binding targets and initiate policy reform that could confirm China’s role as a global leader in the energy transition.

Key findings:

Coal power construction and commissioned projects remain high, with no clear signs of slowing. 21 gigawatts (GW) was commissioned in H1 2025, the highest first-half total since 2016. And full-year additions are expected to exceed 80 GW, according to association projections. Construction starts and restarts reached 46GW, equivalent to the entire coal power capacity of South Korea and sustaining the high pace set in 2022.

New project approvals remain strong, with signs of pre-carbon peak acceleration. 25 GW was permitted in H1 2025, slightly down from previous years. However, new and revived proposals totalled 75 GW, the highest H1 figure in a decade, reflecting a continued push to advance coal projects before the 2030 carbon peaking deadline.

The commissioning boom of 2025 reflects a delayed response to the permitting surge of 2022–2023, when more than 100 GW of coal power was approved each year. Unless policy action is taken, these previously approved projects will continue to drive high levels of commissioning in 2026–2027.

Clean energy is expanding at unprecedented speed, reshaping China’s power mix, while coal’s role in generation continues to decline. Wind and solar additions are expected to exceed 500 GW in 2025, which is more than enough to meet total electricity demand growth. Coal’s share in power generation dropped to a historic low of 51% in June 2025. At the same time, renewables account for 60% of total installed capacity, compared to about 34% for coal. Yet coal capacity continues to rise, highlighting a widening disconnect between capacity growth and actual power generation.

Coal power is not fulfilling its intended role as a flexible backup for renewables. Current dispatch practices predominantly rely on coal power plants for ramping up power generation when needed, with minimal incentives or explicit requirements to flexibly scale down power generation.

China still lacks a coherent coal exit strategy, and power plant retirements are far behind official targets. Only 1 GW of coal power was retired in H1 2025, with just 16 GW retired since 2021. To meet the 14th Five-Year Plan goal of 30 GW by the end of 2025, 13 GW would need to be retired in H2, which appears to be an increasingly unlikely prospect.

The upcoming Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and 15th Five-Year Plan offer a crucial opportunity to establish a clear, coordinated roadmap for managing coal power’s decline. While China’s energy policy direction is aligned with long-term climate goals, the absence of binding targets and institutional reform has allowed legacy incentives for coal power to persist. Without stronger national guidance, clean energy progress may be offset by continued coal expansion, delaying energy transition and stalling emission reductions.

Share THERE ARE CERTAIN STATES and congressional districts where Democrats believe focusing on energy costs could be particularly beneficial.
Energy prices have already become a key issue in the governor’s race in Virginia, which is home to dozens of energy-guzzling data centers.","EARLIER THIS YEAR when Democratic officials began to strategize about the midterm elections, there was widespread agreement that their message should emphasize rising costs. In the Democratic campaign committees and up and down the halls of Congress, the consensus was that the party should focus relentlessly on Donald Trump’s tariffs and the GOP’s Medicaid cuts.

But that focus has started to shift.

High prices are still the main theme, and Medicaid cuts and tariffs will continue to be an important component of Democrats’ midterms argument. But the party increasingly sees political opportunity in centering its message on rising energy prices. As electricity bills are spiking around the country—rising twice as fast as the rate of inflation—Democrats have started to weave the issue into more of their ads and talking points, believing it’s an effective way to tar a president who reneged on his commitment to lower prices.

Most of the Democratic consultants and lawmakers that I spoke to for this newsletter said that energy prices are easier to talk about on the campaign trail than tariffs (especially when some Democrats have gotten tripped up talking about the merits of “targeted tariffs”). Soaring energy bills will also be of interest to a wider audience than, say, Trump’s Medicaid cuts, as energy prices affect nearly all Americans. And the sense is that this issue is only going to become more pressing: Energy is expected to keep getting more expensive before next November.

Plus, Democrats believe, it’s fairly straightforward to explain why Republicans are to blame.

“They ran on this platform of lowering costs. And Trump and Republicans in Congress then passed legislation that will increase costs across the board,” said Sara Schreiber, the senior vice president of campaigns at the League of Conservation Voters, which recently launched a $4 million push in swing states on the GOP budget law. “It’s an intuitive thing. You’re thinking about your electric bill all year round.”

A few other recent efforts:

This month, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee ran digital ads focusing on rising energy costs. It has also been more aggressive about amplifying local coverage of spiking costs.

Clean Energy for America, an advocacy group, recently ran billboard ads in swing districts going after Republican House members who “just voted to raise your electricity bill.”

Climate Power, a Democratic-aligned advocacy organization, is airing an ad blaming Trump for higher energy costs.

And the Democratic National Committee has also been focusing on the issue, with plans to have former Washington Gov. Jay Inslee (who now works at Climate Power) on their YouTube show this week to highlight the topic.

Beyond the 2026 midterms, rising energy costs also present Democrats and climate groups with an opportunity to hit reset on the issue. For much of the last quarter-century, from the days of Al Gore through the debates over the carbon tax, the party has struggled to talk about climate change without using alarmist rhetoric that feels divorced from most voters’ focus on the dollars and cents of their energy bills. Efforts from lawmakers and climate advocates to center the conversation on pocketbook issues haven’t generally been effective, leaving Democrats vulnerable to GOP attacks. But there’s growing hope that will change this election cycle.

“It is critical to talk about climate change in an economic frame,” said Christina Polizzi, a spokesperson for Climate Power. “It is a political liability for Republicans to directly raise costs on Americans across the country, and for Donald Trump to say, ‘Hey, you’re on your own if an extreme weather event comes to your town.’”

Even before the Republicans’ “Big Beautiful Bill” was signed into law, energy prices were rising in part due to new data centers for cryptocurrencies and AI. But the bill compounded that issue by stripping away Biden-era federal tax credits for cheaper renewable energy like wind and solar. Recent analyses found that the new law could increase the average family’s energy bill by as much as $400 per year within a decade.

THERE ARE CERTAIN STATES and congressional districts where Democrats believe focusing on energy costs could be particularly beneficial. Energy prices have already become a key issue in the governor’s race in Virginia, which is home to dozens of energy-guzzling data centers. Plus, the argument could be more potent in red states that will lose clean-energy jobs under the new law as well as states with more extreme climates that make voters especially vulnerable to increased prices. JoAnna Mendoza, a retired Marine who is running in the Democratic primary for the chance to challenge Republican Rep. Juan Ciscomani in Arizona’s 6th Congressional District, has focused a lot of her campaign messaging so far on rising energy bills.

“In Arizona, it is hot as hell. It is so freaking hot, it’s triple digits. AC is on nonstop. Just last month, I had a $400 bill and I know I’m not alone,” Mendoza said in a phone interview. “It doesn’t matter whether you’re a Republican, an independent, a Democrat, or you don’t follow party politics at all—you’re going to feel it in your pocketbook.”

In a social media post last week, Arizona Sen. Ruben Gallego described it as a matter of life or death: “Across the country electricity prices are rising twice as fast as inflation. Families already stretched thin can’t afford it. And in Arizona in August, this isn’t just about comfort. It’s about survival.”

Most Democratic officials that I spoke with last week said that the fact that Republicans were already acting anxious and attempting to blame this problem on past Democratic administrations was a sign that Democrats had landed on a winning issue.

Listen, for example, to how Donald Trump’s energy secretary, Chris Wright, talks about the blame game. “The momentum of the Obama-Biden policies, for sure that destruction is going to continue in the coming years,” the former fracking CEO said in an interview last week with Politico. “That momentum is pushing prices up right now. And who’s going to get blamed for it? We’re going to get blamed because we’re in office.”

Democrats are counting on that.

🫏 Donkey Business:

— Among the most contentious subjects the Democratic National Committee will discuss at its annual summer meeting this week is the 2028 primary calendar. Alex Thompson reports in Axios that “Nevada, New Hampshire, and Michigan are currently the frontrunners to be ‘the new Iowa,’ and lead off the 2028 Democratic primary season.” Potential presidential candidates are already reaching out to DNC members to quietly develop relationships with them before they lock in the calendar.

The primary calendar might seem in the weeds, but whatever the DNC ends up deciding will say a lot about how they view the future of the party and which parts of their coalition they want to prioritize.

Some party leaders that I’ve spoken to about this in the past few weeks have expressed concern about going with a bigger state like Michigan where the candidate with the most money to run TV ads will be at an advantage. Thompson also notes that some “operatives worry that a spotlight on the state’s large Arab and Jewish populations could further stoke divisions in the party over the war in Gaza.” Other party leaders have suggested that they ought to go with a smaller, more rural state (like Iowa!) that would force candidates to tailor their message to parts of the country that have turned away from Democrats in recent elections.

— As the two most populous states move forward with their plans to redraw their congressional maps—with a more-red Texas map just awaiting Gov. Greg Abbott’s signature and a more-blue California map to be voted on in a special election this November—pressure is growing on other states to also take action ahead of the 2026 midterms. Republicans are eyeing Florida, Ohio, Missouri, and Indiana as potential opportunities to pad their advantage in the House while Democratic leaders in New York, Illinois, and Maryland are considering their options. Republicans still have a clear advantage here, since more Democratic-leaning states have independent redistricting commissions that complicate mid-decade map drawing. Yet Democratic leaders are still urging them to act.

“Right now, these other states need to step up,” Rep. Robert Garcia (D-Calif.) told Politico. “I know it’s hard, I know it’s complicated. . . . But, if you’re a blue state governor, the time is now to step up and get it done.”

The rescission of the Endangerment Finding threatens what we have fought for, our powder days, our air quality, and the rural recreational resort we call home.","As we picnic and listen to Holst’s “The Planets” and our children enjoy the first few weeks of school, it is easy to appreciate how lucky we are to live in this beautiful valley and look forward to the return of the Aspen Design Conference and closing out the summer with Luke Combs over Labor Day.

In addition to the diversity of experiences we enjoy, as one of your elected county commissioners, I know very well from my many conversations the diversity of opinions we also have here. I’m fortunate to work with the conservation community to protect our vast open lands one day, and then, the very next, the ranching community to support their requests for compensation from the challenges inherent to the reintroduction of wolves into our ecosystems.

I know we do not agree on everything, but one area where we can come together is that sound science should inform decision-making. Since 2009, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has relied upon the Endangerment Finding, which recognizes greenhouse-gas emissions endanger our health and welfare. This finding is based on well-established, scientific research that has been proven over the decades.

Unfortunately, we are no strangers to the impacts of climate change. We have lower spring snowpack, earlier spring runoff due to increasing temperatures, and an increase of 40 frost-free days on average from the 1960s to the 2010s. The serviceberries and Gambel oak leaves are crimson, flaxen, and plum — and not from lower evening temperatures but from this extreme drought we face. The leaves are covering the trail in August; marcescence, there is no delay to their leaf drop. This extreme drought we face is impacting nearly everyone around. Many of us are under water restrictions. I had several conversations with ranchers who received the earliest call ever from the District 5 Water Engineer to shut off their ditches. A neighbor’s well is dry in August, and she is looking for solutions for her family and her neighbors. No matter your perspectives on climate change, we can all agree it’s getting hotter and drier here in the valley, and that inaction is unacceptable.

That’s why we are leading the way in Pitkin County. We approved 18,300 solar panels on a former bio-solids waste site. We had Olympic athletes and elementary school students testify in support of a solar array off of Highway 82. In 2025, CORE, one of our key partners, has awarded over $750,000 in grants to valley residents, businesses, and governments to electrify everything from induction cooktop to cold source heat pumps. I recently visited with our Public Works Department to enjoy the vehicles we are rolling out to our Sheriff’s office and Open Space and Trails. The new Chevrolet Silverado has a 493 mile range. The only anxiety is not range — it is velocity. We can make a transition, and we are.

We also know we cannot act alone. Sadly, when we need leadership more than ever, the EPA has proposed rescinding the Endangerment Finding that so much of our national climate policies depend on. Our community showed up in droves to testify on behalf of a solar field on an Aspen Consolidated parcel, and we need your voice to show up once again.

SAN FRANCISCO, CA, UNITED STATES, August 24, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- Energy America (EA), a USA-based solar module manufacturer and EPC contractor, together with Centauri, its advanced R&D arm, today announced their official entry into the Saudi Arabian renewable energy market. The companies have been granted an investment license from the Kingdom’s Ministry of Investment (MISA), enabling them to operate as a local entity and partner directly with Saudi stakeholders under the framework of Vision 2030.

This milestone unlocks Energy America’s ability to develop utility-scale solar photovoltaic (PV) power plants with integrated Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS), modernize Transmission & Distribution (T&D) networks, and explore the establishment of local solar module manufacturing facilities. These initiatives will strengthen Saudi Arabia’s renewable capacity while building local supply chains, creating jobs, and ensuring technology transfer to Saudi citizens.

U.S. Technology and Financing: A Strategic Advantage for Saudi Arabia

Energy America’s market entry reflects the growing demand for transparent, compliant, and secure renewable energy supply chains. Recent developments in U.S. policy — including the Trump Administration’s Section 232 investigation on polysilicon and FEOC (Foreign Entity of Concern) restrictions — are reshaping global solar supply, reinforcing the importance of American technology in international partnerships.

For Saudi Arabia, this means access to:

EXIM Bank financing support for large-scale solar and storage projects, providing long-term bankability and sovereign-level risk mitigation.

U.S. regulatory alignment, ensuring solar assets deployed in the Kingdom are free from trade-disruption risks and fully compliant with future global regulatory frameworks.

American-engineered solar modules, designed for reliability in extreme climates and developed with the highest standards of traceability, performance, and durability.

“Saudi Arabia’s bold renewable energy targets and pro-business environment under Vision 2030 make it an ideal place for our growth,” said Jack Stone, Chief Executive Officer of Energy America. “By bringing American technology, FEOC-compliant supply chains, and EXIM-backed financing into the Kingdom, we are ensuring that Saudi projects will not only succeed technically but remain secure from shifting trade and regulatory risks. This is the foundation for a durable U.S.–Saudi partnership in clean energy.”

Saudi Market Entry and Local Partnerships

With the Riyadh investment license secured, Energy America and Centauri will establish a regional headquarters in the coming weeks. The companies plan to collaborate closely with Saudi ministries, utilities, private developers, and supply chain partners to deliver:

Utility-scale solar PV and BESS projects supporting grid stability and round-the-clock clean energy.

Transmission & Distribution modernization, aligned with Saudi Arabia’s expanding electricity demand.

Local module manufacturing feasibility studies, designed to maximize domestic content and create a long-term, U.S.-aligned industrial base.

“Saudi Arabia’s strategic role in the Middle East’s energy transition cannot be overstated,” said Kevin Lumbert, Vice President for Saudi Arabia. “By establishing a permanent presence here, we will directly contribute to Vision 2030 — from solar farms and storage systems to advanced T&D infrastructure. More importantly, we are committed to engaging with local suppliers and training Saudi talent so that this transition creates sustainable jobs and knowledge transfer. With American technology and financing behind us, our projects will deliver lasting value for both Saudi Arabia and the wider region.”

Strengthening Vision 2030 Goals

Energy America’s expansion into Saudi Arabia is structured to:

Support 50% renewable energy generation targets by 2030.

Establish bankable projects financed under EXIM Bank programs, reducing reliance on non-compliant imports.

Create local employment opportunities in engineering, manufacturing, and project execution.

Deliver secure, future-proof energy systems that align with U.S. and Saudi regulatory frameworks.

Home ownership is now a luxury most of us can not afford, and multi-family dwellings are severely lacking in EV charging capabilities.
That leaves residents reliant on our lacking public EV charging infrastructure.","One of the biggest obstacles to EV adoption is that public charging infrastructure can't keep up with demand. Charging at home, for those who are able, is a great way around this, except for one small problem. According to Telemetry, we're too lazy to clean out our garages.

As of a 2021 report by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, 42% of homeowners already park close to a 240-volt outlet capable of Level 2 charging, regardless of what they drive. But a lot of people use their garages for general storage rather than parking a car inside. Using a garage for its intended purpose would, in itself, give 68% of homeowners easy access to a charging outlet with no other changes required.

To put it another way, 31 million homes are currently capable of EV charging, according to Ars Technica. Simply cleaning out the garage and parking inside would increase that number to 50 million homes. In many cases, 90% according to Telemetry, it's possible to add a 240-volt outlet to a garage that doesn't already have one. Doing so brings the number of homes capable of EV charging to 72 million.

While these numbers sound like sunshine, lollipops, and rainbows for the future of EVs, the real world is a bit more complicated. The cost of adding a 30-amp, 240-volt outlet to a garage for EV charging can be quite expensive. This is particularly true of older homes, built when practical EVs were just a figment of our imagination, but even some newer homes may not support this. It can cost thousands of dollars to have a suitable outlet installed, which negates or even exceeds the cost savings of buying an EV in the first place. While it is a one-time purchase that will support whatever EVs you plug in for many years to come, that initial cost is a hurdle many homeowners can not afford to overcome.

Of course, this assumes you can afford to buy a house in the first place. Households now require an annual income of $118,530 to afford the average American house, more than 52% above the median income, according to Investopedia. Home ownership is now a luxury most of us can not afford, and multi-family dwellings are severely lacking in EV charging capabilities. That leaves residents reliant on our lacking public EV charging infrastructure. At least the $5 billion allocated to expand and improve this is still there despite the Trump Administration's efforts to stop it, as we predicted.

The Trump administration paused the project late Friday.

READ MORE:

Expert say Revolution Wind has reportedly created more than 1,200 jobs in the region.

Many of those new jobs are occupied by union workers, and some told NBC 10 they were caught off guard by the stop-work order.

With 45 turbines already in the ocean 15 miles from the Rhode Island coast (and Orsted, the project's parent company, planning to install 20 more), some union experts say Revolution Wind has been a game changer for several Ocean State residents.

""[This impacts] hundreds of workers. There's 300 union jobs that are being performed out on the ocean right now and another 360 on shore,"" said Patrick Crowley, the President of Rhode Island's AFL-CIO chapter. ""People are frustrated right now. This is an important part of our economy. These are good union jobs.""

Some critics of the Revolution Wind project say the national security concerns and impact on the commercial fishing industry would be harmful.

Even with this criticism, amplified by the Trump administration's decision Friday, some members of Rhode Island's Congressional delegation are pushing back to try and get the project across the finish line.

""We're trying to determine what leverage we can pull that'll help get this project recommenced and completed,"" said Sen. Jack Reed (D-RI).

Senator Reed believes the work stoppage could be a bargaining chip for the Trump administration, referring to the saga with Equinor's Empire Wind project in New York a couple of months ago.

""[The Trump Administration] went to [New York Governor Kathy Hochul] and said 'we want you to approve a natural gas pipeline which was having difficulty being approved.' Well eventually, surprise, the pipeline got approved and they lifted the ban on the completion of the project,"" Sen. Reed said.

Orsted said in a statement that they are working to resolve the stoppage and complete the project before the end of 2026.",https://turnto10.com/resources/media/e38c99b4-1d25-46be-a186-0f960dca45cc-large16x9_McKeeWindEventpresser_frame_105165.jpeg,N,,2025-08-24 19:01:17.175448

Earlier this month, Orsted sought the $9.4 billion of financing from shareholders to help fund its Sunrise Wind project off the New York coast after potential partners pulled out due to Trump's hostility to wind power.

With construction now frozen at 80% completion, Orsted has no immediate path to revenue generation, heightening pressure on the company as it seeks to shore up finances through a $9.4 billion emergency rights issue.

The stop-work order, issued by the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM), is the administration's latest effort to hinder U.S. renewable energy development and is the second time this year the Interior Department, which oversees BOEM, has halted work on a major offshore wind project.

""Orsted is evaluating all options to resolve the matter expeditiously,"" the company said in a statement, adding that it was reviewing the financial implications of the order and was considering legal action.

The company said it would ""in due course"" advise the market on the potential impact on its plans to conduct the rights issue.

Orsted is investing into American energy generation, grid upgrades, port infrastructure, and a supply chain, including US shipbuilding and manufacturing extending to more than 40 states.

Orsted’s US offshore wind projects have totalled approximately 4 million labour union hours to date, 2 million of which are with Revolution Wind.

A spokesperson for the company, owned 50.1% by the Danish state, declined to comment further.

On his first day in office in January, President Donald Trump suspended new offshore wind leasing pending an environmental and economic review of projects. He has repeatedly criticized wind energy as ugly, unreliable and expensive.

The $1.5 billion project that Orsted was constructing, Revolution Wind, was scheduled to be completed next year and expected to produce enough electricity to power 350,000 homes in Rhode Island and Connecticut.

All offshore foundations had been installed and 45 out of 65 wind turbines were already in place, Orsted said.

The National Ocean Energy Industries Association, an industry trade group, said halting work on a project that is almost finished would jeopardize jobs and investment.

“These projects are not only about energy,"" NOIA President Erik Milito said. ""They advance priorities of the Administration by restoring American manufacturing, strengthening shipbuilding, modernizing ports, and building the reliable power needed to support data centers and AI innovation.

“Today, the U.S. has only one fully operational large-scale offshore wind project producing power. That is not enough to meet America’s rising energy needs. We need more energy of all types, including oil and gas, wind, and new and emerging technologies. Offshore projects take years of investment before delivering results, and stable, consistent policy is essential to keep that progress moving.""

The stop-work order is driven by unspecified national security concerns arising from the administration's review of offshore wind projects in federal waters, according to the letter, signed by BOEM acting Director Matthew Giacona.

The bureau is seeking to protect U.S. national security and prevent ""interference with reasonable uses of the exclusive economic zone, the high seas, and the territorial seas,"" Giacona said.

Orsted is among the biggest global offshore wind companies, but its U.S. business has suffered setbacks in addition to the broader challenges facing the global offshore wind industry, which is struggling to meet ambitious government targets amid soaring costs and project delays.

Earlier this month, Orsted sought the $9.4 billion of financing from shareholders to help fund its Sunrise Wind project off the New York coast after potential partners pulled out due to Trump's hostility to wind power.

Potential co-investors for the Sunrise Wind project pulled out after Trump's administration in April ordered Equinor to halt the development of a fully-permitted wind farm.

LAND TRANSPORT (CLEAN VEHICLE STANDARD) AMENDMENT BILL (NO 2)

First Reading

Hon CHRIS BISHOP (Minister of Transport): Madam Speaker, I present a legislative statement on the Land Transport (Clean Vehicle Standard) Amendment Bill (No 2).

DEPUTY SPEAKER: That legislative statement is published under the authority of the House and can be found on the Parliament website.

Hon CHRIS BISHOP: I move, That the Land Transport (Clean Vehicle Standard) Amendment Bill (No 2) be now read a first time. I nominate the Transport and Infrastructure Committee to consider the bill, with a period of four months and one day for the select committee process.

This bill is a short bill that makes needed changes to make it more likely that New Zealanders will benefit from the clean vehicle standard rather than face higher vehicle prices because of it. The standard is our light vehicle fuel-efficiency or carbon dioxide standard. If it works as intended, New Zealanders will benefit from estimated fuel savings of $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion over 2023 to 2050 and 8.2 million to 9.6 million tonnes of carbon dioxide emission reductions over the same period.

We’ll only achieve those benefits if vehicle importers achieve the standard’s annual carbon dioxide targets. This is because every vehicle that doesn’t achieve its target attracts charges. If importers can’t offset those charges with credits earned on low-emissions vehicles, then those charges flow through into high vehicle prices. Higher prices will make it even harder for New Zealanders to afford to replace their vehicles with more fuel-efficient and lower-emitting vehicles. To prevent this outcome, the bill gives importers more flexibility in how and when they comply with the targets; flexibility is critical because importers can’t control all the factors affecting whether they can supply the low-emissions vehicles needed to comply with the targets, nor can they control whether consumers will buy them.

Currently, many importers are not achieving their targets and are attracting charges because of unfavourable supply-and-demand conditions. For example, there is currently a shortage of used EVs available for importers to supply to our market, so the bill makes it easier for importers to offset charges with credits. There are three main ways it does this.

First, it allows credits to be transferred between used-vehicle importers and new-vehicle importers; currently this can’t happen because credit transfers between the sectors are prohibited. To acknowledge the greater fuel-saving value of new low-emissions vehicles, the bill sets a 2:1 exchange rate—so you’ll need two credits earned on used vehicles to offset a charge on a new vehicle. Secondly, the bill extends the lifespan of credits from three years to four years. This gives importers more time to use the credits that they earn from importing volumes of fuel-efficient vehicles. Third, the bill extends the ability for importers to offset the charges accrued in a year by supplying and selling more low-emissions vehicles the following year when conditions improve. Currently, the ability to borrow credits will stop at the end of 2025.

Finally, the bill futureproofs the standard by enabling targets to be set that are not adjusted by vehicle weight. It’s the Government’s view that this ability will be needed over the next five years as EVs and hybrids disrupt the traditional positive relationship between vehicle weight, fuel use, and emissions. In other words, soon, large SUVs will not need easier targets than small hatchbacks. The bill makes it more likely that the standards’ annual carbon dioxide targets will be achieved, and, by doing this, New Zealanders will have access to vehicles that cost less at the pump and reduce carbon dioxide emissions.

So, with those brief remarks, I commend the Land Transport (Clean Vehicle Standard) Amendment Bill (No 2) to the House.

ASSISTANT SPEAKER (Teanau Tuiono): The question is that the motion be agreed to.

Hon Dr DEBORAH RUSSELL (Labour): This bill is a bit of a shocker, really. It’s an extraordinary thing that that side of the House is doing. It stacks up with all their other climate-denying work, but this one is a bit of a corker.

I don’t get it. The reason that we have clean car emission standards is so that we start transitioning our fleet from internal combustion, using fossil fuels, to electric vehicles. The idea is to actually decrease emissions. It’s a critical need. We have a Paris target of reducing our climate emissions to net zero by 2050, and the way we have been trying to do that is, primarily, so far under this Government, by planting more trees. We’ve carried on emitting carbon. We’re not trying to get actual carbon emissions down. Instead, we’re just offsetting them with trees. The trouble is that that approach is going to fail. We cannot plant our way out of climate change. In order to effectively address climate change, we have to get emissions down.

There are two major sources of greenhouse gas emissions in our country—two major industries or areas of our economy that we get greenhouse gases from. One is from agriculture, and there is whole lot of work going on in that space to see how we can actually reduce methane flow. That’s what we have to do with methane flow. The other is transport. Transport is one of our biggest sources of greenhouse gas emissions. And unlike methane, where there are some pretty interesting technologies coming through which may help with that—in terms of carbon, we have to get the emissions down.

The clean car standards were a part of that. The whole idea was to incentivise the transfer over to an electric vehicle fleet. There were a whole lot of strategies around that. One was the Clean Car Discount, a scheme that was working really well; and one was this clean car importer standard. This whole clean car importer standard was a way of incentivising the uptake of electric vehicles by ensuring that we had to bring more electric vehicles into the country in the first place. This bill changes that around. It’s noticeable, in the departmental disclosure statement, that the people that were consulted with included the motor vehicle industry but did not include the Climate Change Commission. In fact, there’s very little assessment of the impact that it will have on our climate emissions. Going through in terms of deciding on which option was best to address this policy, the people who had all the input on it were various industry stakeholders. They were the people who were consulted to see whether or not we should change around the Clean Vehicle Standard.

Going through the regulatory impact statement is quite an eye opener. I’ll see if I can find the relevant bits. The way it sets it out is it says that current vehicle importers were not going to meet the target for importing clean vehicles, so they’ve changed the targets. They’ve just simply changed the targets. Well, that’s not going to get emissions down, is it? “Oh, we’re not going to be able to do it, so we just won’t do it.” But we still need to get emissions down. Climate change is a pressing, pressing need for us to address. What are they doing? They’re consulting vehicle importers about how to avoid getting emissions down. It’s a shocking bill, and it demonstrates, yet again, that this Government is not—is not—committed to addressing climate change. The Labour Party does not support this bill.

ASSISTANT SPEAKER (Teanau Tuiono): The member’s time has expired.

Hon JULIE ANNE GENTER (Green—Rongotai): Tēnā koe, Mr Speaker. Kia orana, Mr Speaker, and tēnā koutou e te Whare. The Green Party is not supporting this bill. As someone who worked closely on both the Clean Car Standard and the Clean Car Discount in the initial days, I can tell you that those were evidence-based policies that have been used in other jurisdictions to improve fuel economy. And the overall benefits to New Zealand of having more efficient vehicles is undeniable, because we spend more money to drive a given amount on petrol or on diesel, as a consequence of having less efficient vehicles. There’s this bizarre ideology on the other side of the House that somehow having more polluting vehicles is good for New Zealand; it’s not. It’s not good for New Zealand.

The way that the Clean Car Standard and the Clean Car Discount worked was intentionally done so that they worked together. The idea of the standard is quite simple. It’s that over time we’re expecting vehicle importers of both new and second-hand vehicles to improve the fuel efficiency of the vehicles that are being imported. The Clean Car Discount used a feebate signal, which was a levy on polluting vehicles, which is recycled into a discount or a rebate on zero-emissions and low-emissions vehicles. That feebate was actually far more effective than I think anyone realised. I mean, I knew it would be effective, hence why we worked on the policy, but when they actually brought it in, the Labour Government brought it in, it was massively successful and effective.

Usually, the vehicle importers understand that they want something like the Clean Car Discount. They find it difficult to implement the standards without the overt price signal. So the reason why the Government is now having to come back again with another bill to amend the clean vehicle standard—now, this is the second amendment bill in just a few months—is to give importers more flexibility to achieve the standard. Ultimately, what it’s doing is just making it harder for us to achieve the actual targets to achieve the goal.

As the Climate Commission recently recognised, the Government has no plan to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels or things that create greenhouse gas emissions, and that is totally ridiculous in 2025. It’s completely ridiculous, and it’s particularly ridiculous, when you consider that everything we do to reduce the fossil fuel intensity of our vehicle fleet is not just beneficial from a climate point of view, it’s beneficial from an air pollution point of view, it’s beneficial from a pure cost point of view, and from an energy sovereignty point of view.

We have majority renewable electricity generated in this country, right here in this country. Electric vehicles are far more efficient than internal combustion engine vehicles. So just switching to electric vehicles is an efficiency gain, a massive efficiency gain. It doesn’t matter how that electricity is generated. Even if it was generated from coal, it would still be more energy efficient. Now, personally, the Green Party doesn’t believe we should be using coal to generate electricity; there’s no question. But even if it were the case, an electric vehicle would be more efficient than a combustion engine vehicle. So we have everything to gain from switching to more efficient vehicles.

But guess who doesn’t want us to switch more efficient vehicles? The vehicle manufacturers. And the oil companies, obviously. Why? It doesn’t benefit New Zealanders. People would like to spend less money on driving around, wouldn’t they? Well, the best way to do that is to make sure that the vehicles coming into the country are more efficient. And every country in the world that has achieved progress in the area has done so through a combination of standards and price incentives. That’s what works, and the economic benefits massively outweigh the cost.

So, you know, classic National-led Government being lobbied by big corporate interests, and who misses out? Who’s paying the bills on this? Who’s paying for it? It’s New Zealanders paying higher petrol bills, higher diesel bills, higher hospital bills, higher emissions, which is going to cost us in the medium and long term. But this is a Government of absolute climate deniers who can’t even understand how the economy works. I mean, they’re claiming victory from dropping interest rates. Geniuses! They dropped the interest rates because the economy crashed.

MARK CAMERON (ACT): Thank you, Mr Speaker. I must confess to the House that I’m not the actual speaker that would normally speak to this bill, but I have a couple of thoughts, if I may. I can imagine the heckling will begin, at some point in the near future, from my team on the left. But I’m fascinated when I’m trying to digest what the Land Transport (Clean Vehicle Standard) Amendment Bill (No 2) looks like in the real world—in the real world of choice. I think, in a house of debate—and this is, of course, a house of debate—that New Zealanders are a group of collective deniers. Well, certainly, this side of the House is.

As we speak to what this bill does, it extends the lifespan of carbon dioxide emissions credits that are earned on low-emission vehicles—yeah, three or four years—and removes the restriction on carbon dioxide emission credit transfers between new and used importers and various sectors.

I just want to touch on a point that the previous member did make—that this side of the House were climate change deniers. I find that an oddity that that side of the House, if I could be so obliging to share a couple of thoughts pursuant to Indonesian coal—now, in the world of hydrocarbons, if I get the pronunciation correct, we have seen huge increases to hydrocarbons, like coal in this instance, coming into New Zealand. That helps electrify the grid. If we look at the world of averages—whether it’s electrification and the use of electrified vehicles in this instance or hydrocarbons being used for the sake of petroleum by-products or petroleum or diesel or petrol—how can we not square up, either way when we’re having this debate, that invariably there’s an endpoint user that has a pollution problem. Now, it could be the electrification of the grid and a greater consumption of it, or it could be used in hydrocarbons that are used in motor vehicles that happen to be internal combustion engines.

I am a bit struck by Julie Anne Genter’s remarks. I don’t think it is balanced to say, in this instance, that members on this side of this House are climate change deniers. We’re just having a balanced debate. Where I land on this bill, having not had a chance to read a great deal of it—I maintain that it sort of lands on about the right place in the world of averages, so, on that basis, I commend it to the House.

ANDY FOSTER (NZ First): Thank you, Mr Speaker. I rise on behalf of New Zealand First to speak on this Land Transport (Clean Vehicle Standard) Amendment Bill (No 2). This is something I think was signalled in the 2024 Budget that this work was going to be done. In fact, it’s interesting in the speaking notes I’ve got here that I refer to it being proposed by the Hon Simeon Brown. So it suggests it was a little while ago that this was being talked about.

This clean vehicle standard is about trying to make sure that over time the emission levels, which are produced by vehicles which are imported into this country, are progressively reduced. That doesn’t change in this bill. What this bill is mostly about is two things. The first one of those is about saying, “Let’s do that. Let’s hit those targets by regulation rather than by locking them in legislation.” Because—oh gosh—every time we change a piece of legislation we’ve got to go through the whole process. That is enormously expensive, enormously cumbersome. And quite frankly, why we don’t lump a whole lot of these pieces of small legislation together—that would be much more efficient. That would certainly reduce a lot of hot air.

The first thing that this bill does is to say instead of doing it through legislation, let’s do it through regulation, so it is a much more flexible, much quicker way of responding. Of course, different Governments may do that in different ways in terms of the regulatory process. So the standards and the process still exist. [Interruption] It’s wonderful seeing the byplay going across the House there. But anyway, I’ll carry on with it.

Look, over time we are quite clearly seeing the vehicle fleet, by and large, becoming more efficient. Obviously, we’ve had an uptake of electric vehicles: we’ve got plug-in hybrid vehicles, we’ve got more hybrid petrol vehicles as well. And the level of emissions from those, and the fuel efficiency of those, is coming down.

In fact, that is one of the reasons we’re having to look at changing the way in which the whole road transport system is funded. Because what’s been reliant on both the road-user charges and FED, the fuel excise duty, that level of charge, particularly the FED side, is starting to reduce. That is a problem for our ability to be able to fund transport generally, whether it’s public transport or maintaining and building our roads. So we need to change things there. Over time the intent is that we will get a more efficient vehicle fleet, and then, obviously, we’ve got to change the funding around it.

I just want to pick up on one other thing, which is what my colleague Mark Cameron was talking about, about choice. What is the part that the market plays in this? What we should be trying to do is to send the right signals in terms of the actual costs that apply: the costs of using the road, the weight of vehicles on the road and so on, the damage the vehicles do to the road—but also, the emissions side of things, and that’s why we have an emissions trading scheme, for example, whether that’s working efficiently or ineffectively. Then people can make their choice. They can say, “Well, an electric car may cost me more to buy in the first instance. But is it cheaper to run because it’s more efficient? Yes, maybe. Maybe I choose that; maybe I don’t.” And people have the ability to choose that depending on the circumstances and the needs that they have for their particular vehicle. That is called choice. That is called a market. We need to make sure that we do that because we can’t be forcing people to make particular choices.

I’m looking forward as the chair of the Transport and Infrastructure Committee to seeing this piece of legislation in front of us, the submissions that we get on it, and to making decisions on that and reporting that back to House in due course. I commend this bill to the House.

MARIAMENO KAPA-KINGI (Te Pāti Māori—Te Tai Tokerau): Kia ora tātou. Thank you, Mr Speaker. Kia ora tātou e te Whare. I rise to speak for Te Pāti Māori on the Land Transport (Clean Vehicle Standard) Amendment Bill (No 2). So here I am—here I go. This bill undermines our commitment to reducing climate change through the Clean Vehicle Standard. It does so by introducing more flexibility in meeting the targets, which, effectively, weakens the standard itself.

[Authorised reo Māori text to be inserted by the Hansard Office.]

[Authorised translation to be inserted by the Hansard Office.]

Specifically, the bill extends the lifespan of carbon dioxide emissions credits earned on low-emission vehicles from three years to four. It removes restrictions on transferring these credits between the new and used import sectors, and it allows borrowing of future carbon dioxide target overachievement beyond 2025. This subject itself isn’t one of one of my—you know, I don’t know this really well, but certainly listening to Julie Anne Genter and others, when I did spend a little bit of time with the Transport and Infrastructure Committee at times, I believe her, is the thing to say.

The Clean Car Standard limits the average carbon dioxide emissions from the tailpipes of new cars imported into Aotearoa. I’m sorry, I just heard a bit of muttering over to the left there; wasn’t sure what it was meant to do.

Arena Williams: Just muttering.

MARIAMENO KAPA-KINGI: Yes, yes, another bunch of mumbling, bumbling ideas. It was introduced to reduce emissions and prevent our country from becoming a dumping ground for inefficient vehicles rejected in other places with stricter environmental rules—worth noting.

Te Pāti Māori climate change policy is designed to incentivise low-income and rural farming, and that takes quite a bit, knowing that I come from Te Aupōuri and so on and they’re like, “How are we going to get a blinkin’ plug-in thing here, Meno?”, but let me tell you, the mood is changing. Our whānau are getting that this is a smart and good thing. So let’s just keep talking about this, making it happen, and making it work. So, to incentivise low-income and rural farmers to purchase electric and low-emission vehicles.

This bill, however, makes it harder to achieve these goals—thank you to those on the left. Climate change poses an existential threat not only to our environment but to our way of living and to our people and to our place and to our identity. So it just gets more grave the more I read on. Any legislation that prioritises short-term profits over long-term health of our taiao and of our environment harms our grandchildren and our great-grandchildren. So be it on your heads, to those on the left. Modelling shows that by 2035, these changes could result in 39,000 fewer fully electric vehicles and 19,000 fewer plug-in hybrids on our roads. This is yet another piece of legislation pushed through by this Government to weaken environmental protections for short-term gain.

The Government often speaks of striking a balance, and I was listening to that bit of rhetoric earlier, but I don’t believe them, and I’m not convinced; it has very little merit, when I hear it from the left of the House, when we face already multiple once-in-a-lifetime extreme weather events every year. Obviously, I think of Whangaroa when I’m talking about that, I think of Whangārei, I think of Te Kaipara and those terrible moments which they talk about being once in a lifetime but, in fact, I think I’ve probably experienced about four or five lately. And still people deny; still Government is denying that these things are real and have serious and long-term impacts for our whānau on the ground every day. Even now, when you go through Kaeō and you go through Whangaroa and you go through the back road, it’s the decimation of properties, farms, roads, structures, infrastructure to a tiny little town reduced hugely by all of the flooding that happens not just once in a lifetime but far too often.

So there is absolutely no way that we would support this. We do not support it, we do not commend it, and we would ask that maybe change your mind. Let’s do that. Kia ora tātou.

DAN BIDOIS (National—Northcote): Good news for Labour and the Greens today. Statistics New Zealand figures just out show that emissions in New Zealand decreased to December last year by 1 percent—total greenhouse emissions. In 13 out of 16 regions in New Zealand it decreased. So despite the rhetoric from the other side, something is working in the coalition Government with respect to emissions. So on that basis, I look forward to welcoming the bill at select committee and I commend this bill to the House.

Dr CARLOS CHEUNG (National—Mt Roskill): For communities like Mt Roskill, home to many hard-working families, this bill matters. It supports our climate goals but also makes cleaner vehicles more accessible and affordable. By giving suppliers more flexibility, we reduce costs that would otherwise be passed on to the consumer. This means families in Mt Roskill can benefit from cleaner, cheaper-to-run cars without being priced out. It is a fair, smart, and future-focused policy. I commend this bill to the House.

ARENA WILLIAMS (Labour—Manurewa): Thank you, Mr Speaker, for the opportunity to speak on the Land Transport (Clean Vehicle Standard) Amendment Bill (No 2). What a shame it is that we are here debating this bill, which will take us another step backwards away from New Zealand’s Paris Agreement targets. They are targets that this Government claims to still be honouring, and yet Government Ministers just yesterday in the House at question time were waving haere rā to Paris, haere rā to climate leadership, and haere rā to New Zealand’s place on the world stage as a nation that actually did its bit and gave young people around the world and young New Zealanders a fair go. [Interruption]

Who’s going to pay the cost of this, Mark Cameron? Who’s going to pay the cost of this, James Meager? I’ll tell you. The people who will pay the cost of bills like this—the Land Transport (Clean Vehicle Standard) Amendment Bill (No 2), which is a tax break for industry—are the young New Zealanders who are going to pick up the bill for the remediations that we will need to pay as a nation going forward.

Do you know what this bill does? This bill lets some importers bank up their credits for as long as they like and sell them to other parts of their business or—it’s quite unclear yet, but we’ll get to the bottom of it in the select committee—others who would otherwise import dirty vehicles longer and more than they would have otherwise under a Labour Government. This bill puts dirtier cars on the road. This bill makes it harder for those people who want to transition to be able to do that. This bill is a sop to industry, who asked for it, and it doesn’t have any place in a Parliament that would pride itself on values-based and evidence-based policy to deal with climate change. This is a real shame.

There are two major areas that New Zealand should be focusing on in reducing its climate—

Mark Cameron: Oh, here we go.

ARENA WILLIAMS: —obligations, and Mark Cameron says, “Here we go.” He doesn’t want me to talk about the farmers, so I’ll give him the good answer that he’s after. Transport is one we all agree on. Transport is part of New Zealand’s economy where there are good wins to be made. I’ll tell you who said that: the Hon Simon Bridges, when he was the transport Minister.

Remember when the Key Government used to like electric vehicles (EVs)—when they used to point to electric cars as part of a transport solution which would actually make a difference to Aotearoa? They said, “Oh, buses—we’re not so keen on buses. Trains—we’re not so keen on trains. But EVs are coming, guys—just wait.” Well, now this is what’s coming: the next National Government, which walks that back. You can’t trust them.

You can’t trust them when they point to some techno solution. These guys are looking into the future and they’re casting around for something that will get us out of the hole without doing any of the heavy lifting, and then the next National Government comes around and says, “Oh well, it was all too hard, and industry has come with their hands out and we feel very sorry for these big car manufacturers, who have all these tax credits banked up that they can’t get the value out of. So we’re going to let them use those tax credits for money. That’ll be good—that’ll sort it out.” No, it won’t sort it out. It won’t help people buy cleaner cars, it won’t help reduce the footprint of the transport fleet in New Zealand, and it certainly won’t help future generations and young New Zealanders get themselves out of this mess.

Many of the MPs, in a few hours, will be meeting with groups of young people from the Aspiring Leaders Forum. They are here today in Parliament because they think about the future issues that affect our country. They have tried very hard to get into this programme and are proud to be here.

Dr Carlos Cheung: You are here to advocate for people in South Auckland.

ARENA WILLIAMS: Some of them are from the member Carlos Cheung’s electorate of Mt Roskill, and they believe in MPs like him to represent their generation for the future. What they are seeing from a debate like this is that this Government is happy to lump costs on to their generation and their children’s generations because they will not deal with the reality now, which is that we need standards, we need rules that are debated and set by this Parliament, where we are accountable to them.

You know, instead of having this debate in the future, we won’t actually have it in here at all, because it will be set by regulation, and Andy Foster stands up and he goes, “Oh, good, the bureaucrats can sort it out. Get that red tape out and wrap it all around these standards. Elected members shouldn’t be accountable when they are lumping costs on to future generations. Elected members should not be accountable to young people.” Well, I say to Mr Andy Foster that he is an excellent committee chair, but he is dead wrong on this issue.

Andy Foster: Oh, not at all—not at all.

ARENA WILLIAMS: Young people want you to advocate for them, Andy Foster. Young people deserve parliamentarians to come to this House and give it a go—to give them a fair go—that their generation wouldn’t be picking up the bill for short-sighted legislation like this.

Dr VANESSA WEENINK (National—Banks Peninsula): I’d just like to bring the energy in the room down a little bit; I think that’d be good. Because this is just another example from the other side of where they’re just yelling and screaming about something, when they’ve demonstrated that they’re not bothered to talk to industry about how things might actually work. We have listened to the way that pragmatic things need to be done. We have provided flexible options so that we can actually get more clean vehicles into this country. I commend the bill to the House.

The U.S. is the world’s largest oil and natural gas producer, but many of its best drilling locations have been tapped. While oil production is expected to plateau or fall in coming months, gas remains a bright spot for the industry thanks primarily to the country’s booming exports.

U.S. LNG exports are on track to soar from a record 11.9 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) in 2024 to 21.5 bcfd in 2030, according to a U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) outlook. U.S. LNG producers are building new terminals to superchill gas to its liquid state for export. They aim to meet booming demand for the fuel worldwide to meet rising energy consumption and as many countries phase out coal-fired power plants.

That is providing robust growth prospects for the nation’s gas production regions. Morgan Stanley projects gas output in the Haynesville shale in Louisiana will soar by 41%, and in the Permian Basin in Texas and New Mexico by 21% from 2024 to 2027. The Marcellus and Utica shales, which span parts of Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia, will grow by 9%, according to the Morgan Stanley estimates.

U.S. gas producers and investment firms are gearing up for more activity in Haynesville, positioning themselves for the boom in LNG exports boosted by new approvals from U.S. President Donald Trump.

“Within a 300-mile radius of our (Haynesville) assets, there (are) more than 12 bcfd of LNG demand under construction to be in service by 2030,” Domenic Dell’Osso, CEO at Expand Energy, the nation’s biggest gas producer, told analysts in July.

Already this year, U.S. energy firm Venture Global LNG has sanctioned the construction of CP2, its third export plant in Louisiana; while rival Cheniere Energy decided to build two additional liquefaction trains at its Corpus Christi plant in Texas. Australian firm Woodside Energy Group said it would move forward with its Louisiana LNG project.

Analysts expect more energy firms to take advantage of Trump’s favorable federal permit policies to build additional LNG export plants and pipelines over the next 12 months.

TRAPPED GAS

Overall, the EIA projects U.S. gas output will climb from a record 103.6 bcfd in 2023 to around 113.5 bcfd in 2030, with most of that fuel going to meet soaring LNG export demand. Canada, meanwhile, will also supply an average of around 7.0 bcfd of pipeline gas to the U.S. over the next five years.

Even with LNG demand rising, the EIA projected total U.S. gas demand, including domestic consumption and exports, would only rise by around 1% per year on average from now through 2030, climbing from a record 111.5 bcfd in 2024 to about 120.3 bcfd in 2030.

That slowing growth comes as domestic gas consumption slides from a record 90.5 bcfd in 2024 to around 89.6 bcfd in 2030, due mainly to declines in the amount of gas that power generators burn as renewable output rises.

Some other energy analysts, however, expect U.S. power generators will burn more gas in coming years than the EIA forecasts to meet fast-growing demand for electricity from power-hungry data centers.

New pipelines and other infrastructure will be needed to transport the gas to market.

In the U.S. Northeast, capacity to transport gas will likely remain constrained, capping potential output growth there to just about 3 bcfd by the end of the decade unless more pipelines get built, according to East Daily Analytics analyst Jack Weixel.

In July, Western Maine Energy Storage filed for a preliminary permit from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) for a proposed development near the Central Maine Power transmission corridor. The project would be mostly in Dixfield, with a small portion in Canton, in Oxford County.

The FERC permit, which will secure the site for further studies including economic and environmental feasibility, is the first step in a permitting process that will take years.

Western Maine Energy Storage was established by the Pittsfield-based Cianbro Corporation in May 2024 to spearhead the “water battery,” shorthand for the two-reservoir system that involves pumping and storing water to meet the grid’s energy needs.

A primary goal of the project is to boost resilience by putting power onto the grid at times when other renewable resources, like wind and solar, aren’t generating electricity. A prime example of this is during evening hours after the sun has set, when energy demand, also known as the load curve, tends to peak.

“We all do appreciate the renewables on the grid, but they can’t always supply the energy electricity that we need. So a project of this nature will help stabilize that supply,” said Lauren Walsh, Cianbro’s corporate environmental manager.

The proposed 500 megawatt project would be the state’s first and only the fourth such energy development in New England. Two pumped storage hydropower plants have operated in Western Massachusetts for decades, and Connecticut has a smaller facility that’s been in operation since the late 1920s. There are a handful of such projects around the country, according to FERC data.

How does pumped storage hydropower work?

In order to function, pumped storage hydropower relies on differences in elevation in order for water to flow between two artificial reservoirs.

Oxford County’s topography makes the chosen location a match for the proposed development. Western Maine Energy Storage plans to build an upper and lower reservoir, each at 100 acres in size. The two reservoirs will be connected by a pipe. A powerhouse sitting just above the lower reservoir will generate electricity whenever water flows down from the upper reservoir and passes through a turbine. That electricity can then be passed onto the grid.

“When power is relatively cheap, you pump water up, and then when it gets really expensive, or there’s a lack of juice in the system, you flow it back down,” said Tom Brennan, director of public affairs with Western Maine Energy Storage.

Initially, the two reservoirs will be filled from the Androscoggin River in what Brennan described as a “sipping” process that will take anywhere from 10 months to a year. After that, both he and Walsh stressed that the site will function as a closed-loop project. Overland runoff and precipitation will make up for water that’s lost by evaporation.

Currently, the project timeline stretches into the early 2030s. Walsh said the goal is to begin construction in 2031, with the facility coming online in 2033, though that’s dependent on how quickly Western Maine Energy Storage can move through the permitting process with FERC.

Maine Department of Environmental Protection and the Army Corps of Engineers will also weigh in on the federal regulatory process, Walsh said. She also said that Maine DEP has already been contacted as they look to work through the environmental processes together.

From a grid reliability standpoint, Maine Renewable Energy Association’s executive director Eliza Donoghue said she is encouraged about what the project means for the state and addressing the grid’s ongoing affordability and reliability challenges. MREA is a trade association involved in advocacy at the state legislature and at the Maine Public Utilities Commission.

“There is no doubt that electricity demand across the country and including on our shared grid in ISO New England territory is going to go up significantly,” said Donoghue. Fossil fuels are one part of the affordability problem, as prices fluctuate depending on the global market.

Pumped storage hydropower, on the other hand, can help contribute to affordability, Donoghue said. Though she anticipates hard questions from stakeholders as Western Maine Energy Storage continues to engage with communities, she commended the project on its ingenuity in advancing Maine’s clean energy transition.

“What I’m hopeful for is that folks can see how reliable this technology is and how it can be a real problem solver,” Donoghue said.

If energy developers’ plans are fully realized, large-scale solar power additions in the U.S. would reach a record single-year high, said the EIA.
Joe Lombardo wrote that in Nevada “solar projects deep in the project pipeline have been frozen” by the administration’s July announcement.
While Nevada’s solar capacity has grown substantially, most of the new solar capacity nationally in 2025 was attributed to Texas, California, and Arizona.
Texas accounted for more than a quarter of the solar power developed so far in 2025.","NEVADA – Solar is set to account for half of new electricity added to the grid in the United States this year, according to predictions from the Energy Information Administration.

The forecast comes as the Trump administration has set up roadblocks to clean energy development, including funding cuts and an order that directs Interior Secretary Doug Burgum to personally approve all solar and wind energy projects on public lands.

Developers are on track to add 33 gigawatts of solar power in the U.S. in 2025, accounting for about half of the total new electricity generating capacity planned for the country, the agency said on Wednesday.

In the first half of the year, 12 gigawatts of solar capacity was added to the grid with the remaining 21 gigawatts planned in the second half.

If energy developers’ plans are fully realized, large-scale solar power additions in the U.S. would reach a record single-year high, said the EIA.

Battery storage, wind, and natural gas power plants account for virtually all of the rest of the 64 gigawatts of capacity additions planned for 2025.

Solar energy does not produce global warming emissions. That makes it central to plans by U.S. states to decarbonize, while also meeting record-high electricity demand brought on by energy-intensive industries like data centers.

Many of the federal government financial incentives that propelled the development of solar power over the last several years, however, will disappear under the administration of President Donald Trump, adding uncertainty to future developments.

On Aug. 1, Interior Secretary Burgum signed an order seeking to rein in “environmentally damaging” solar and wind power projects on federal lands. Burgum said the clean energy technologies were an inefficient use of “federal lands when compared to other energy sources with much smaller footprints, like nuclear, gas and coal.”

A week later, the Environmental Protection Agency announced it was ending a $7 billion program that offered solar energy grants to help states develop solar for low-income households. Nevada lost a $156 million grant from the cancellation.

Last month, Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill” rolled back most federal support for renewable energy, including tax credits that fueled solar development.

But a July 15 memo mandating that all solar and wind energy projects on public lands be personally approved by Burgum could be especially significant for Nevada – where more than 80% of land is federally managed.

In an Aug. 4 letter to Burgum, Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo wrote that in Nevada “solar projects deep in the project pipeline have been frozen” by the administration’s July announcement.

One of the projects listed by Lombardo – 174 Power Global’s Boulder Solar III project – is listed by the EIA as one of the solar projects planned for installation in 2025, but it has yet to receive regulatory approval by the federal government.

“Solar energy development in Nevada is crucial to our state’s economic future and will contribute to the Nation’s energy dominance and independence,” Lombardo wrote.

In 2024, Nevada ranked fourth in the nation in total electricity generation from utility- and small-scale solar resources combined. Solar provided 31% of the state’s total generation, according to the EIA.

While Nevada’s solar capacity has grown substantially, most of the new solar capacity nationally in 2025 was attributed to Texas, California, and Arizona.

Texas accounted for more than a quarter of the solar power developed so far in 2025. For the second half of the year, Texas plans to add another 9.7 gigawatts of new solar capacity, or nearly half of all of U.S. solar planned for development over that time period.

Battery storage accounted for the second-largest share of capacity additions in the first half of the year, about half of which was in Arizona or California.

Relatively little generating capacity has been retired this year, according to the EIA.

In the first half of the year, only 2 gigawatts of the 8.7 gigawatts scheduled to be retired from service this year were pulled back. More than 3.6 gigawatts of power planned for retirement have been delayed or canceled.

If the other planned retirements stay on track, coal-fired power plants will account for 71% of the retired capacity this year, followed by natural gas at 19%.",https://dehayf5mhw1h7.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/2472/2025/07/17135118/manny-becerra-ngdhrwax0j8-unsplash-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-08-24 19:02:03.189323

The next funding battle looms as Trump is directing a major federal crime crackdown in D.C.","The battle between top Republicans and Washington, D.C., could see another wrinkle next month, when Congress returns to a race against the clock to prevent a government shutdown by the end of September.

Local leaders said the last shutdown showdown left the District with a roughly $1 billion budget hole after Congress overrode its local spending plans. And the looming Sept. 30 funding deadline comes as tensions between Republicans and Democrats over the District have hit a fever pitch amid President Trump’s crackdown in the capital.

D.C. Council member Christina Henderson said Friday that local leaders remain in discussions with spending cardinals on Capitol Hill to prevent history from repeating itself.

“We are continuing our conversations with our appropriators and the four corners in Congress, because we know that sometimes the politics of the White House are very different from the politics of appropriators in terms of actually doing appropriations,” Henderson said.

D.C. was granted what’s known as “home rule” in the 1970s, but its budget is still approved by Congress.

Congress in March passed a GOP-crafted stopgap to fund the government through the end of the fiscal year, or late September, at mostly fiscal 2024 levels.

But unlike previous stopgap funding bills, the measure passed in March notably left out language allowing D.C. to spend its local budget — which consists mostly of funds from local tax dollars, fees and fines — at already approved 2025 levels.

As a result, D.C. officials said the District was forced to spend at its fiscal 2024 levels like federal agencies under the stopgap — despite running at its updated budget levels for roughly half a year.

At the time, top GOP appropriators said the long-standing provision was left out in error, despite some Democratic suspicions. But while the Senate quickly and unanimously approved a bill to remedy the issue, the House has yet to move on it almost six months later after hard-line conservatives pushed leadership to delay the measure while pressing for new “requirements” for the District to spend their local dollars.

Since then, House Republicans have led multiple efforts D.C. advocates have criticized as “anti-home rule,” including advancing legislation aimed at blocking non-U.S. citizens from voting in local D.C. elections. Some Republicans in Congress have even floated repealing home rule.

The next funding battle looms as Trump is directing a major federal crime crackdown in D.C. He has federalized the local police department, deployed more than 1,000 National Guard troops to the nation’s capital and instructed federal agents from the FBI; Drug Enforcement Agency; Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives; and immigration enforcement to help patrol the streets.

Republicans are cheering his efforts and agitating for them to continue — even though data shared by city leaders shows crime had already been decreasing in recent years.

Trump has challenged those figures, however, and has accused the city of producing “fake crime numbers in order to create a false illusion of safety.” He also warned D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser on Friday to “immediately stop giving false and highly inaccurate crime figures, or bad things will happen.”

That includes what Trump described on Truth Social as a “a complete and total federal takeover of the city.”

Trump signaled interest in wading further into the city’s operations, telling reporters on Friday that he plans to ask Congress to greenlight $2 billion for improvements in the District.

“We’re going to have this place beautified within a period of 12 months,” he said.

Richard Stern, director of the Grover M. Hermann Center for the Federal Budget at the Heritage Foundation, a prominent conservative think tank, said he expects the growing clash between Trump and D.C. to take another turn.

Looking back on March’s shutdown fight, Stern said Friday that Congress’ “accidental” cut to the D.C. budget “generated an accidental test case.”

“I think what came out of it is Democrats walked away from it saying, ‘OK, we’re in a less strong position on this in public than we thought we were,’ and Republicans walked away from it saying, ‘We’re in a stronger position publicly than we thought we were,’” he said.

A YouGov survey released earlier this month found that almost half of Americans “strongly” or “somewhat” disapproved of D.C.’s police being put under federal control and National Guard troops being deployed in the city.

But a closer look found a sharp divide by party identification. Less than 10 percent of respondents identifying as Democrats approved of the move, compared with 26 percent of those who identified as independents.

Meanwhile, 74 percent of Republican-identifying respondents approved the recent actions by the administration.

“Everything since then has gone in congressional Republicans’ favor about, what’s going on with D.C. and people’s thoughts about it, all the way up to Trump deploying the National Guard, and that being popular enough, if not very popular among elected Republicans, let alone, the conservative base,” Stern said.

“Because of all that, I think that’s why this is on the table is a strong thing to Republicans in a push for.”

Despite what the District called a $1.13 billion cut to its previously approved budget authority, Bowser’s office said in May that it was able to prevent layoffs, furloughs and facility closures, while protecting dollars for “public safety and public education ecosystem.”

However, it has cited a number of measures it took as a result of the reduction, including a hiring freeze that cut back on “$63 million in personnel costs,” and it made “$175 million of non-personnel services reductions” and shifted more than $200 million in spending and costs for workforce investment and housing production from fiscal 2025 to fiscal 2026 and 2027.

“You don’t want to have the same situation happen again,” Henderson said Friday, “whereas, you know, you’re beating the city over the head talking about you’re not doing enough on public safety, and then you’re literally saying we can’t spend our money on the thing that you told us to fix.”

“That’s nonsensical, but crazier things have happened,” she added.",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/thunejohn_johnsonmike_082225gn01_w.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-08-24 18:00:46.091211

National studies echo air quality concerns raised by CleanAIRE NC.
Addressing the problem Findings like these underscore the need for accessible information about air quality — which CleanAIRE is working to address through a new web platform, CleanAIRE Academy.
“The landscape of environmental health in North Carolina has drastically shifted in recent months,” CleanAIRE NC said in a statement.
“Air Quality 101” is designed to build a user’s foundation in air quality.","Since the start of the Trump administration, federal officials have been rolling back funding to federal environmental programs and scientific research — moves that threaten to leave vulnerable communities with fewer resources to address air quality concerns. That reality, along with the desire to broaden its reach, prompted the Charlotte-based advocacy group CleanAIRE NC to launch a new interactive online tool designed to educate North Carolinians on environmental issues and provide them with resources for healthier communities.

“Air pollution is an invisible and often understated problem, yet its impact on public health is profound,” said Rafi Vaca, CleanAIRE NC education manager. “We created this platform to demystify complex issues and inspire meaningful engagement.”

Mounting research reveals ongoing threats to air quality in urban and rural settings, from vehicle emissions, industrial sources and agriculture. One recent study found that residents living near concentrated animal feeding operations face significantly higher exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5): Levels were 28 percent higher near large cattle operations and 11 percent higher near industrial hog farms compared with communities farther away.

CleanAIRE NC has responded to air quality issues by partnering with communities across the state — from Charlotte’s Historic West End to rural Sampson County — to establish local air-quality monitoring and provide training and educational support for residents most affected by pollution.

A sense of urgency

Particulate matter, or particle pollution, is a mix of solid particles and liquid droplets in the air. Some, like dust, pollen or soot, are visible. Those usually fall in the range of PM10, particulate matter that is 10 micrometers, or about one-fifth the diameter of a human hair.

Other particles, such as PM2.5s, are so small they can only be seen with powerful microscopes, according to information provided by the EPA. Exposure to particle pollution can trigger serious health problems, including heart attacks, worsened asthma, reduced lung function and even premature death in people with heart or lung disease.

National studies echo air quality concerns raised by CleanAIRE NC. A 2022 report found higher risks of mortality across all age groups in U.S. regions with elevated PM2.5 levels — areas that often include vulnerable or low-income communities. The authors said the findings highlight the need for more equitable policies to improve air quality.

A 2018 study found that efforts to reduce PM2.5 levels in the U.S. from 1999 to 2013 resulted in a reduced mortality rate among elderly Americans, “worth $24 billion annually by the end of that period.”

Even as the Clean Air Act faces mounting challenges, environmental groups like CleanAIRE NC are working to bridge the gaps created by shifts in federal and state policy. The U.S. Supreme Court’s 2023 Sackett v. EPA decision redefined “Waters of the United States,” stripping federal protection from some wetlands. More recently, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced plans to reevaluate the 2009 Endangerment Finding, which declared greenhouse gases a threat to public health. Leaders of CleanAIRE say that together, these developments illustrate the importance of efforts like theirs to inform and empower communities.

Addressing the problem

Findings like these underscore the need for accessible information about air quality — which CleanAIRE is working to address through a new web platform, CleanAIRE Academy.

“The landscape of environmental health in North Carolina has drastically shifted in recent months,” CleanAIRE NC said in a statement. “Growing concerns about our state’s readiness to handle potential environmental emergencies, coupled with recent legal changes, underscore the urgent need for informed community engagement. The CleanAIRE Academy offers a reliable, expert-backed source of information, with content developed by seasoned professionals in air quality, health, policy, advocacy and data science.”

“The CleanAIRE Academy greatly expanded my knowledge of air quality and advocacy,” said Naami Abbey, a student at the University of North CarolinaCharlotte, who described herself as “passionate” about environmental justice and community health.

Abbey was an early user.

“The self-paced courses made learning so much easier, deepening my understanding of air quality and how to turn concern into meaningful action for environmental justice,” she said.

How the academy works

The academy offers two learning modules. “Air Quality 101” is designed to build a user’s foundation in air quality. The second, “Advocacy in Action,” helps participants “learn to navigate policy, craft compelling messages, and engage effectively with decision-makers.”

Four more modules are planned: “Air Pollution and Your Health,” “Environmental Justice,” “AirKeeper Dashboard” and “Community Science and Air Monitoring.”

“CleanAIRE NC has had a history of providing this type of environmental and air pollution education, starting with Atrium Health Network residents,” said Vaca, Clean AIRE’s education manager. “That was to connect environmental factors and pollution to support health outcomes, especially since this is often missing from traditional medical school curricula.""

Vaca said that the shift to online learning will help the organization meet growing demand. “We can’t always take on additional projects like in-person trainings, but the requests we receive from communities facing pollution and other environmental challenges keep growing. So we wanted to scale our work to support them, even if we didn’t have a dedicated grant for their community.”

Vaca expects the academy to expand as it gains traction, to reach beyond their usual partners to transportation agencies or corporations.

“It’s for the public and our impacted communities,” Vaca said. “Now we want to grow it and expand it so it covers a lot more topics.”

Drawing on experience

The idea for the academy originated in house with staff experts in 2024.

“Part of the reason it’s taken so long is because we are getting expert advice and going through a full review process to gather feedback and update these courses so they meet the highest standards,” Vaca said.

The potential audience of academy users includes residents of affected communities, academics, students and policy makers, Vaca said.

In terms of what Vaca hopes academy course enrollees gain from the experience, she said: “I hope our participants or students see that these topics don’t have to be boring or intimidating.

“The takeaway should be that hope and resilience come when we lean on our communities, when we educate ourselves and support the work that is already being done for a cleaner environment.”

The case is part of a growing climate litigation movement led in part by Indigenous youth.
Maria Antonia Tigre, director of global climate change litigation at the Sabin Center for Climate Change at Columbia Law, said lawsuits like this take on new salience in light of the Trump administration’s rollback of climate action.","On August 9 and 10, a massive storm over southeastern Wisconsin dropped up to 13 inches of rain in just a few hours, sending floodwater gushing downriver and destroying more than 1,800 homes in Milwaukee. The disaster was the second-worst two-day rain event in the United States since 1871.

“For years, scientists have warned about what can happen when climate change supercharges extreme weather events. This is exactly what they meant,” the Milwaukee Sentinel Journal reported, describing the disaster as a 1,000-year flood.

Now, more than a dozen youth from Wisconsin, including Indigenous youth, are filing a lawsuit against the state’s utility regulator to force it to consider climate change when evaluating new fossil fuel projects.

Currently, Wisconsin law blocks the Public Service Commission from taking air pollution — including carbon dioxide emissions — into consideration during the permitting process. Fifteen children and teenagers, ages 8 to 17, filed a lawsuit Friday against the utility regulator alleging that the law violates their constitutional rights to life and liberty.

The case is part of a growing climate litigation movement led in part by Indigenous youth. Twelve-year-old Miahlin B., who goes by her tribal name Waazakone, and her three siblings joined the lawsuit because climate change is eroding their traditional ways of life.

The children harvest wild rice, which is sacred to their communities, but warming temperatures are making it harder to grow rice successfully. They tap sugar maple trees to make maple sugar, but last year came up dry in part because of a shorter winter season. They fish for walleye and sturgeon, but both fish populations are shrinking as waters warm.

Waazakone told Grist she wants to protect her community for future generations. She describes herself as a water protector, explaining that caring for water is part of her responsibility as a female member of the Little Traverse Bay Band of Odawa Indians.

“We need the government to understand that clean water and air is a human right and our most valuable resource,” she said.

The youth plaintiffs are also challenging a Wisconsin law that prohibits the Public Service Commission from mandating more renewable energy from local utilities. Right now, about three-fourths of the state’s electricity generation comes from fossil fuels like oil and gas. That’s on par with the national average, but lags far behind states like South Dakota where more than 75 percent of its state energy production comes from renewables.

The plaintiffs are represented by Midwest Environmental Advocates, a Madison-based environmental nonprofit law center, and Our Children’s Trust, an Oregon-based nonprofit dedicated to advancing youth-led climate litigation.

The latter is perhaps best known for its successful litigation against the state of Montana in Held v. Montana. In December, the state’s Supreme Court affirmed that Montana youth have a constitutional right to “a clean and healthful environment,” and concluded that the state should take greenhouse gas emissions into account when considering new fossil fuel projects. The state hasn’t considered any new oil and gas projects since then, so it remains to be seen what that will look like in practice.

“Wisconsin doesnʻt have any fossil fuel extraction like Montana, but they do continue to have an electricity sector that’s dominated by fossil fuels. Itʻs the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the state,” said Our Children’s Trust attorney Nate Bellinger, who is representing the Wisconsin plaintiffs.

The nonprofit has filed dozens of lawsuits in the U.S. over the last decade and a half, including one against the Trump administrationʻs reversal of President Joe Bidenʻs climate policies. Last year, they helped secure a landmark settlement in Hawaiʻi with the case Navahine v. Hawaiʻi Department of Transportation, where youth plaintiffs contended that the state’s commitment to expanding infrastructure to support gas-powered cars and disregard for cleaner options violated their constitutional right to “a clean and healthful environment.” There, the state agreed to develop a plan to zero out carbon emissions from its transportation sector by 2045.

In Wisconsin, the constitutional right to a clean environment isn’t as explicit as in Montana or Hawai’i, where there is language in the state constitution spelling out that right. Wisconsin Democrats tried unsuccessfully earlier this year to add that language to the state constitution. But the attorneys in this new case are arguing that a stable climate system is necessary to achieve the constitutional rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.

Maria Antonia Tigre, director of global climate change litigation at the Sabin Center for Climate Change at Columbia Law, said lawsuits like this take on new salience in light of the Trump administration’s rollback of climate action. “It’s even more important to bring these cases now given the current state of the United States’ stance on climate change in general,” she said.

A spokesman from the Wisconsin Public Service Commission declined to comment on pending litigation.

As state leaders grapple with mounting costs of flood recovery and plead for federal assistance, Waazakone hopes that her lawsuit forces them to take climate change seriously.

“I want the state of Wisconsin to realize that you cannot allow businesses and people to continue to erode our futures,” she said.",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2228751860-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-08-24 19:02:12.882140

From reducing import dependency to boosting exports and creating jobs, the PLI scheme is more than a policy—it’s a catalyst for structural change.","India’s manufacturing sector is witnessing a quiet yet powerful revolution, driven by the ambitious Production Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme. With an outlay of ₹1.97 lakh crore, the scheme has become a cornerstone of India’s goal to elevate manufacturing’s share to 25% of GDP, positioning the country as a global industrial powerhouse. As of March 2025, the PLI initiative has approved 806 applications across 14 strategic sectors, attracting investments worth ₹1.76 lakh crore and generating over 12 lakh direct and indirect jobs.

Launched in April 2020, the PLI Scheme initially targeted mobile manufacturing, electronic components, pharmaceuticals, and medical devices. Its success prompted its expansion to 13 additional sectors, including automobiles, textiles, solar PV modules, and semiconductors. The scheme’s performance-based incentives, tied to incremental sales and production, have drawn both domestic and global players, fostering innovation and economies of scale. By November 2024, committed investments stood at ₹1.61 lakh crore, with total sales by PLI participants surpassing ₹16.5 lakh crore, reflecting robust growth in electronics, pharmaceuticals, and automotive sectors.

The electronics sector stands out as a flagship success. Backed by the National Policy on Electronics 2019, the PLI scheme has propelled India into the global electronics value chain. Production in this sector surged by 146%, from ₹2.13 lakh crore in FY 2020-21 to ₹5.25 lakh crore in FY 2024-25, with major smartphone companies shifting production to India. This has transformed India into a leading mobile phone manufacturing hub, making technology more accessible and affordable under the Digital India initiative.

In the automobile and auto components sector, the scheme has attracted ₹67,690 crore in committed investments, with ₹14,043 crore realized by March 2024, creating over 28,884 jobs. Aligned with the Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Electric Vehicles (FAME) initiative, the PLI scheme is positioning India as a global hub for electric vehicles and clean technology, supporting 19 categories of advanced automotive technology vehicles and 103 categories of components.

The pharmaceutical sector has also seen remarkable progress. Once reliant on imports for bulk drugs, India has flipped the script, moving from a ₹1,930 crore trade deficit in FY 2021-22 to a ₹2,280 crore surplus in FY 2024-25. Pharma sales under PLI have crossed ₹2.66 lakh crore, including ₹1.70 lakh crore in exports, with domestic value addition reaching 83.7% by March 2025.

In the renewable energy space, the PLI scheme for high-efficiency solar PV modules is set to create 48 GW of fully integrated manufacturing capacity, reducing import dependence and bolstering energy security under the National Solar Mission. Investments of ₹48,120 crore have been committed, generating nearly 38,500 direct jobs as of June 2025.

The semiconductor sector is another success story. With six projects already underway and four new manufacturing units approved in Odisha, Punjab, and Andhra Pradesh, the India Semiconductor Mission, backed by ₹76,000 crore, is driving India’s integration into global electronics value chains. These projects, with an additional ₹4,600 crore outlay, are expected to create over 2,034 skilled jobs and spur indirect employment.

Textiles, food processing, and white goods (ACs and LED lights) are also reaping benefits. The textiles sector, with a ₹10,683 crore outlay, has boosted man-made fibre exports to ₹525 crore and technical textile exports to ₹294 crore in FY 2024-25. The food processing sector, with 171 approved applications, has seen investments of ₹8,910 crore, complementing schemes like PM-FME and PMKSY. Meanwhile, the white goods sector is transitioning India from an assembly hub to a high-value manufacturing base, targeting 75-80% domestic value addition by 2028-29.

Beyond numbers, the PLI scheme is reshaping India’s industrial landscape by fostering sector-specific clusters, such as semiconductor parks in Gujarat and medical device parks in Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu. It is also catalyzing foreign direct investment and strengthening the MSME ecosystem by creating supplier and vendor networks around anchor units. The government’s increased budget allocations for 2025-26 signal a strong commitment to sustaining this momentum.

From reducing import dependency to boosting exports and creating jobs, the PLI scheme is more than a policy—it’s a catalyst for structural change. By aligning with national goals like Atmanirbhar Bharat and the $5 trillion economy vision, it is powering India’s industrial renaissance and cementing its place in global supply chains.",https://ddnews.gov.in/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/favicon.png,N,,2025-08-24 23:00:28.173309

India boosts renewable energy equipment production. The government supports local manufacturing through PLI schemes and approved lists. New guidelines may increase wind power capacity and exports. Non-fossil fuels now comprise half of India's power generation. Experts see data centers and EVs driving clean energy demand. Technology advancements will determine the future energy mix.

The government is working on multiple fronts to support domestic manufacturing of renewable energy equipment for capacity addition as well as creating its domestic demand, renewable energy secretary Santosh Kumar Sarangi said.

Speaking at a panel discussion on 'Advancing India's Green Transition: Aligning Policy, Innovation and Industry for a Net-zero Future', moderated by ET's Shilpa Samant, Sarangi said apart from the production-linked incentives (PLI) schemes, which include solar cells, ingot-wafers and polysilicon, the renewable energy ministry has brought an approved list of models and manufacturers (ALMM) for modules and cells, and for wind power equipment.

The ministry is in talks with the industry for such a list for ingot-wafers. ""Once that comes, we will see some clear commitments on the part of the industry to set up ingot and wafer manufacturing in India and I am sure in course of time polysilicon as well is going to come on a big scale,"" Sarangi said.

JP Chalasani, CEO of Suzlon Group, said the new guidelines on wind power equipment manufacturing may help significantly increase domestic capacity even at sub-component levels. There's going to be a large capacity addition and a high probability of increase in exports, he said.

India has emerged as the world's fourth-largest in installed renewable energy capacity, with non-fossil fuel sources now making up half of its total installed power generation capacity.

Live Events

Vaishali Nigam Sinha, cofounder of ReNew, said all steps are in the right direction to get to 500 GW by 2030, which is an ambitious milestone. ""We are very optimistic and all stakeholders have achieved more than what was possible,"" she added.

Alternate demand centres

Reliable and consistent availability of renewable energy is likely to help meet the demand for data centres, industry experts said.

According to Arunabha Ghosh, CEO of public policy think tank Council on Energy, Environment and Water, more options for offtake of clean energy such as data centres and electric vehicles are coming and it is not confined only to power distribution companies.

Vibha Dhawan, director general of policy research institute The Energy and Resources Institute (Teri), said technology advancement is likely to determine the right energy mix in the future, with green hydrogen and/or nuclear energy expected to get into the mix.

Power will always be available if there is a demand, Suzlon's Chalasani said. To maintain grid stability and still have affordable power, it is important to have a combination of solar, wind and storage, he added.

""It will never be one versus another. What will happen depending upon the different load profiles of some states is that the combination might change,"" Chalasani said.

Sarangi said as far as demand from data centres and green hydrogen is concerned, there are technological solutions available today to provide them with renewable energy.

For immediate release

More than 50 organisations spanning the eastern seaboard have today issued an open letter to Climate Change and Energy Minister Chris Bowen, urging the Federal Government to urgently fund a network of Local Energy Hubs across Australia.

From community groups to peak environment and industry bodies, the signatories are united in their call for a practical solution in rural and regional communities where renewable energy projects are being proposed or built, often without adequate information or support.

RE-Alliance, Community Power Agency and Yes2Renewables have been calling for the Federal Government to fund Local Energy Hubs across Australia, a proposed network of outreach centres staffed by locals to assist communities navigating renewable energy and transmission projects, while helping local households, businesses and farms to lower their energy bills and electrify.

Wendy Farmer from Voices of the Valley in Gippsland, Victoria, said: “Local Energy Hubs will build community trust in renewables, turning confusion into confidence and sparking community led change, making the energy shift work for everyone”.

In NSW, community group Good for the Gong has been urging local politicians to secure funding for Local Energy Hubs for the Wollongong region.

“Wollongong has huge potential to lead the energy transformation. It’s a windy place, with lots of local ventures already exploring ways to capture and store renewable energy. A Local Energy Hub would be a valuable resource for the community to access accurate and up-to-date information and make the most of the opportunities in renewable energy, from new jobs to cheaper, cleaner energy for households,” said Ali Gerritsen, spokesperson for Good for the Gong.

While 70% of people living in renewable energy zones support Australia’s shift to renewable energy, that support is highly conditional. The open letter argues that Local Energy Hubs are essential to building trust and unlocking the full benefits in the shift to renewables for regional communities.

“Australia has a real opportunity to be a global leader in renewable energy, and that starts with supporting the regions that are powering the country. That means ensuring communities have the guidance, information and support they need to navigate this energy transformation, and secure the benefits that will flow to workers, homes and businesses. Local Energy Hubs can provide that trusted, practical support to help our community with everything from household electrification - all the way to making the most out of the big projects,” said Justin Page, Hunter Jobs Alliance Coordinator.

The organisations warn that given the complexity of the change ahead, what happens in the next five years is critical. Without urgent government action to fund Local Energy Hubs, the shift to renewable energy will not happen at the speed and scale required, putting at risk both community support and Australia’s broader clean energy goals.

“We've been working in regional communities at the centre of Australia's shift to renewables for more than a decade, clearly articulating the case for Local Energy Hubs for more than two years,” said RE-Alliance National Director, Andrew Bray.

“We keep hearing the same thing: we need clear, trusted information and practical support and we can get that through the Local Energy Hubs model. Without it, the rollout of renewable energy will keep running into delays, cost blowouts and opposition. Everyone has a stake in getting this right.”

The full open letter and list of signatories is available here.

Prospective developers seeking to build stations in Wisconsin and share in the state’s federal grant have until Sept. 5 to submit their proposals, according to the Wisconsin Department of Transportation.

Wisconsin was one of the first states to take part in the $5 billion National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) project, part of the 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law.

“Our state DOT was incredibly proactive” in participating in the program, Amy Barilleaux, communications director for Clean Wisconsin, told the Wisconsin Examiner.

The state’s allotment was $78 million and 53 projects were awarded with the funds in May 2024, a state DOT spokesperson said. The department signed 39 agreements accounting for $16 million before the program was frozen earlier this year; eight projects have been completed and five are under construction.

Countermanding the push to reduce reliance on fossil fuels that have been associated with worsening climate change, President Donald Trump issued executive orders promoting fossil fuels and attempting to block measures to promote renewable energy that were enacted during former President Joe Biden’s administration.

One of Trump’s first such orders, on the day he took office, froze NEVI funding that had not been committed to projects by then.

“It should have never been paused in the first place,” Barrilleaux said. “This was money that was allocated by Congress that was ours to spend under this program.”

Wisconsin, along with more than a dozen other states and the District of Columbia, sued to restore the NEVI grants. A federal judge in June blocked the Trump administration from freezing the grants or withholding the money from the 14 states and D.C. that joined the lawsuit.

Barrilleaux noted that by joining the lawsuit, Wisconsin was able to benefit from the ruling that released the money.

U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy issued new guidance for the grants Aug. 11. The new guidance eliminates various provisions in the original federal program, including specifications that emphasized using renewable energy, required consumer protections and required engagement with rural, underserved and disadvantaged communities.

“While I don’t agree with subsidizing green energy, we will respect Congress’ will and make sure this program uses federal resources efficiently,” Duffy wrote in a statement.",https://urbanmilwaukee.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_4316-1024x768.jpeg,N,,2025-08-24 20:00:32.200226

Argonne’s work benefits the U.S. nuclear industry at large.","In May, the United States took another step toward building the country’s first advanced nuclear reactors at an industrial site. The project at a chemical plant in southeast Texas includes four small modular reactors being developed with support from the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE’s) Argonne National Laboratory.

Together with nuclear industry partners, Argonne scientists build on foundational knowledge to innovate new reactor concepts that are expected to be more flexible in site selection and scale and also less costly. These include reactors that could use recycled fuel, power remote communities or military bases, and generate less waste than current reactors to help meet the fast-paced energy needs an AI- and data-driven future demands.

Maryland-based reactor developer X-energy is one of several American companies that collaborate with Argonne to develop the next generation of nuclear energy systems. Its reactors will use a type of fuel called TRISO, a fuel highly resistant to melting down in a high-temperature reactor, which leads some to call it the most robust nuclear fuel on Earth.

The fuel is packed into billiard-ball-size ​“pebbles” that are fed into the reactor by the tens of thousands. Argonne scientists are providing detailed computational fluid dynamics simulations that describe all the pebbles in the reactor core. The research improves understanding of the fuel pebbles’ thermal efficiency and determines reactor efficiency and safety under different conditions. Additionally, Argonne studies the dynamics of water and vapor in the steam generator that will convert heat from the fuel pebbles into electricity.

With companies like California-based Oklo, Argonne explores ways to extract more power from used nuclear fuel, most of which has the potential to be recycled.

Oklo also used Argonne’s Mechanisms Engineering Test Loop facility and Thermal Hydraulic Experimental Test Article pool-type sodium facility to help validate reactor thermal hydraulic and safety analysis codes used in their license application to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

Companies such as Pennsylvania-based Westinghouse rely on Argonne’s suite of software and codes. These tools promote safety and fuel performance analysis in liquid-metal-cooled nuclear reactors, determine coolant flow and temperature distributions, and analyze neutronics and fuel cycle characteristics.

In work funded partly through DOE’s Office of Technology Commercialization, Westinghouse and Argonne use the WATTS platform to develop optimal design solutions for concepts used in Westinghouse’s eVinci microreactor.

Argonne’s work benefits the U.S. nuclear industry at large. Other recent industry partnerships include ARC Clean Energy, Constellation Energy, Dominion Energy, Electric Power Research Institute, Exelon, Framatome, General Atomics, General Electric-Hitachi Nuclear Energy, HolosGen, Kairos Power, Moltex Energy, TerraPower, Terrestrial Energy and Westinghouse, among others. All of these partnerships seek to bring together the unique capabilities of private industry and the vast resources of a national laboratory to advance cutting-edge solutions to the nation’s nuclear energy needs.

India's renewable energy sector is rapidly expanding, exceeding expectations for 2030 green goals, driven by solar and wind power growth. Executives highlighted skill gaps and payment risks as challenges, while emphasizing the need for hybrid projects and energy storage for reliable power.

India's power sector is transforming rapidly with the adoption of renewable energy, putting the country's 2030 green goals within easy reach, industry executives said at the event while flagging skill gaps and payment risks as key challenges. The panel discussion on 'Powering the Trillion-Dollar Energy Transition' was moderated by Devndra Chawla, MD & CEO, GreenCell Mobility.

No country other than China has expanded renewable energy generation capacity as rapidly as India in the past decade, Tata Power chief executive Praveer Sinha said, citing how the nation's solar power capacity has risen to 120 GW now from just 5 GW in 2015. ""While we say that we will do 280 GW of solar and 100 GW of wind (by 2030), I do believe that we have much better capability,"" he said.

Suzlon Group vice-chairman Girish Tanti said reaching 100 GW of wind power capacity by 2030 looks ""almost certain"".

Sinha stressed the importance of hybrid energy projects for round-the-clock supply. ""We already have successful combinations of solar and wind with battery and pumped hydro storage. The goal is to provide reliable power at lower tariffs and make Indian industry globally competitive,"" he said.

Live Events

Tanti also underlined the role of wind in balancing the national demand and supply of energy. ""Solar peaks in the day, but India's consumption peaks in the evening and morning. Only wind can balance that. Together with storage, we can ensure energy on demand,"" he said. India has a vast wind potential of 1.1 terawatt, of which only 4% has been harnessed, Tanti said.

The panellists also pointed to India's rapid progress in renewable energy equipment manufacturing. India's current capacity to produce wind energy equipment is 3-4 times its own annual requirement, making the nation an exporter of ""world class and cost-competitive"" wind gear, Tanti said. ""By 2030 it is expected that India will be supplying almost 10% of the global supply chain of wind and that could go as high as about $25 billion of earnings for our country,"" he added.

Experts on the panel also highlighted challenges facing the sector, ranging from skill shortages to the risk of delayed payments by power purchasers.

""In India, with a lot of distribution companies, the off-taker risk is still much high,"" said Vibhuti Garg, director-South Asia at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA). ""To an extent, that has been addressed by SECI (Solar Energy Corporation of India) and NTPC tenders, which have come up with escrow accounts and payment security funds,"" she said, adding that tenders driven by states lack such risk-handling mechanisms.

Each gigawatt of wind power can generate 8,000-10,000 jobs, said PwC India chairperson Sanjeev Krishan. ""But only 30% of the workforce is job-ready for green roles. The huge focus has to be on skilling. We need structured renewable energy courses in colleges, maybe even start at schools,"" he said. Krishan also spoke about inclusivity. ""What better way to create inclusive growth than by bringing more women into the workforce,"" he said, citing the case of a women's self-help group in the Northeast, which maintains solar rooftops. Garg of IEEFA highlighted the role the private sector has played in the expansion of green energy by providing capital and investing rapidly.

So I was eager to get behind the wheel of a Macan Electric to see what’s really different from its PPE cousin, the Audi Q6 e-tron.

Affordability helps drive EV adoption, which in turn creates a larger supply of batteries available for other uses once their days powering daily commutes and road trips are over.","Few things in the automotive industry are more predictable than the complaints from brand loyalists that a given new model “isn’t a real Porsche.” Because it built its reputation on eccentric rear-engine cars, Porsche has had to weather an unusual amount of this complaining, from when it first experimented with front-engine models like the 924, 944, and 928, to when it switched to water cooling, and of course when it launched the Cayenne SUV over two decades ago. But this time, the purists might have a point.

The Porsche Taycan showed that an electric vehicle could be imbued with the essential Porsche character, but while it was co-developed with Audi (which got the e-tron GT out of the deal), the Taycan was intended be sporty and to sell at a higher price point — putting it more in Porsche’s wheelhouse. That’s not the case with the Macan Electric, the first Porsche based on the Premium Platform Electric (PPE), the latest EV architecture from the Volkswagen Group.

Recommended Videos

Also a joint project between Porsche and Audi, PPE is intended for a wider variety of models to be sold in higher volumes than the J1 platform that underpins the Taycan and e-tron GT. So far that includes two Audi models and the Macan Electric, which is intended to replace Porsche’s bestselling gasoline model (it’s already done so in Europe, but the old gasoline Macan is still being sold in the U.S. for the time being). That gives Porsche less wiggle room for expensive bespoke engineering that could raise prices. So I was eager to get behind the wheel of a Macan Electric to see what’s really different from its PPE cousin, the Audi Q6 e-tron.

Looks like a Porsche, inside and out

With a base price about $15,000 higher than the Q6 e-tron, job one was to make the Macan Electric look like a Porsche, or at least something more expensive than an Audi. Brand-conscious shoppers who care mainly about the badge on the key fob will find plenty of recognizable Porsche styling cues, but thankfully the Macan also turned out to be a good-looking car. The mix of SUV proportions (the Q6 e-tron and Macan Electric are pretty much identical, dimensionally) and details like the Taycan’s rectangular headlights atop 911-style fender peaks shouldn’t work, but they give the Macan Electric an approachable, slightly goofy appearance like those older Porsche sports cars.

Inside, the Macan Electric’s interior is pure Porsche, and not just because the crest of the German city of Stuttgart is prominently placed on the steering wheel. The cabin actually feels like it was designed for driving, not selecting a new podcast while sitting in traffic. The dashboard is low and narrow, incorporating the requisite screens without obstructing visibility. The thin-rimmed steering wheel is a delight to use, and has an easy-to-reach drive-mode switch. You still get cupholders, but they’re out of the way so you won’t knock drinks over while reaching for controls.

This layout meant swapping Audi’s elaborate curved dashboard display for a more discreet 12.6-inch digital instrument cluster (shaped like the analog gauge clusters in older Porsches) and 10.9-inch central touchscreen (as in the Q6 e-tron, a front-passenger screen is also available). Porsche also uses an Android-based infotainment system with standard wireless Apple CarPlay/Android Auto like Audi but, again, the design choices are more driver-focused. Everything you need is in the instrument cluster which, unlike in Audi’s latest infotainment systems, still shows a map view. The main touchscreen might be further away from line of sight than in the Q6 e-tron, but it doesn’t matter.

Drives better, maintains charging performance

For the 2025 model year, Porsche is selling a single-motor rear-wheel drive Macan Electric base model, plus Macan 4, 4S, and Turbo models with dual-motor all-wheel drive. I had the Macan 4, a more basic model with no extras to compensate for any inherent weakness in the chassis tuning. This car didn’t have the optional rear-axle steering, for example, and with 382 horsepower (402 hp with temporary overboost) it was less powerful than a dual-motor Q6 e-tron, let alone the sportier SQ6 e-tron you could have for similar money.

Yet the Macan 4 Electric has the same factory-estimated zero to 60 mph time of 4.9 seconds as the Q6 e-tron, which is just a hint of what’s to come when you get behind the wheel. Perfectly-weighted and precise steering, air suspension that provided a comfortable ride while keeping the Macan Electric flat and drama-free in corners, and abundant grip made for an ideal premium-brand driving experience. The Macan Electric was fun to drive without rough edges, something that can’t be said of its Audi platform-mate. It’s hard to believe the two EVs were developed from the same parts bin.

That parts bin also provides the Macan Electric with an 800-volt electrical architecture, enabling 270-kilowatt DC fast charging that Porsche claims will get a 10%-80% charge done in 21 minutes. Starting at 25% battery capacity, the Macan was also able to recover 117 miles in 10 minutes of charging, making quick road-trip stops possible. That’s assuming you can find suitably powerful 350-kW fast chargers. Porsche will add Tesla Supercharger access in the near future, with adapters for the Macan’s Combined Charging Standard (CCS) port, but it anticipates slower charging at those ubiquitous stations. A standard 11-kW onboard AC charger can complete a full charge in 11.5 hours, according to Porsche.

All Macan models have a 100-kilowatt-hour battery pack (with 94 kWh of usable capacity) as the Q6 e-tron. The base rear-wheel drive model is rated at 315 miles, just six miles less than a rear-wheel drive Q6 e-tron, while the Macan 4’s 308-mile rating is just one mile less than the equivalent version of the Audi. Average energy consumption of 3.1 miles per kilowatt hour over a week of driving in mixed conditions was a good indication that these numbers will be achievable in the real world.

Worth the price?

Pricing starts at $79,995 for the rear-wheel drive base model, which is well above the Audi. The dual-motor Macan 4 bumps the price to $83,595, and because this is Porsche, a healthy list of optional extras left this test car with a $94,855 sticker price. This is at least a good place to stop though. The Macan 4S Electric and Macan Turbo Electric are faster, but range dips below 300 miles as the price goes up.

That the Macan 4 vastly improves on the driving dynamics of the Q6 e-tron while offering similar charging performance and efficiency makes for a great package. Those that simply want a prestige nameplate will find an EV that’s easy to live with, while those who buy into the Porsche mythos won’t be disappointed by the driving experience. If the Audi is drip coffee, this is a handcrafted cappuccino.

This week’s other EV news

There are plenty of expensive EVs, though, so the confirmation of pricing for the 2026 Nissan Leaf this week is especially newsworthy. The rebooted EV pioneer starts at $31,485 in 303-mile S+ trim, making it the lowest-priced new EV in the U.S. — and this isn’t even the cheapest version. Nissan will also offer an S spec, with pricing to be revealed at a later date, as well as a $35,275 SV+ model that undercuts the equivalent 2025 Leaf by $2,000 while offer more standard equipment, and a $40,485 Platinum version.

Affordability helps drive EV adoption, which in turn creates a larger supply of batteries available for other uses once their days powering daily commutes and road trips are over. Toyota has developed an energy-storage system that it’s now testing at Mazda’s main Japanese factory (Toyota owns a stake in the smaller automaker, and the two have collaborated on manufacturing and vehicle development).

In addition to the batteries themselves, this system repurposes energy management systems, allowing each pack to be controlled individually, and allowing for a mix of different configurations and chemistries to be used in one installation. Pending successful tests, Toyota and Mazda want to use this system as a buffer for the factory’s solar array, absorbing excess energy for later use when the sun isn’t shining.",https://www.digitaltrends.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/DSC_0590.jpeg?resize=1200%2C630&p=1,N,,2025-08-24 16:01:03.163225

The industry’s future was considered mainly dead and buried — until the administration of President Donald Trump decided to pull out every stop to dig it out of the grave. And this wasn’t caused by any Green New Deal boogeyman stuff: The coal industry does not have the economics to survive intense competition from less-expensive alternatives.

Trump’s efforts to revive coal will cost the U.S. time and money we can’t afford to waste, driving up energy costs for Americans and leaving the mining communities behind.

As we look toward the future, we should not be reaching backward for solutions to our energy supply.

Coal consumption for electricity has been in a steady decline since at least 2008 as cheaper natural gas and renewable energy sources gained a share of the supply. Coal plants generated only 15% of electricity in 2024, down from 19% in 2020 and 51% in 2001. Based on research from the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, coal is expected to continue its steady decline for the remainder of the decade. The institute estimates that by 2030, 63% of the peak total of coal-fired capacity will be closed, and it’s possible that all remaining coal capacity still online at that point may be shuttered by 2040.

The arguments people made in the past about coal being economically profitable are no longer applicable. Coal plants and mines are usually decades old, they’re high polluters, and they’re not making profits. A study from Energy Innovation finds that 99% of coal plants are more expensive to run than to replace with new solar or wind energy and are getting more expensive to run by the day.

The median cost of new solar projects is $24 per megawatt-hour compared to a median marginal cost of $36 for the operations of existing coal plants.

What’s more, this is an industry that, on its way out, has prioritized taking care of its CEOs, not its workers. As major coal companies filed for bankruptcy in 2015 and 2016, executives got massive compensation increases while workers were laid off and employee benefits were slashed. As profits shrank, executives paid themselves more, while miners paid the price.

This is all to say nothing of the public health consequences, environmental damage, and climate effects that coal mining and power production pose. Despite making up a minority of electric power generation, coal makes up more than half of all harmful climate emissions from the electric power industry.

Coal-fired power plants also have detrimental effects on public health: They were responsible for 460,000 deaths between 1999 and 2020, and they have estimated health costs up to $26 billion annually.

Even as the Trump administration has moved to block permits for wind and solar development and terminated federal clean-energy investments that were already underway, it has thrown every subsidy in the book to revive the dying coal industry. In April, Trump signed an executive order aimed at revitalizing the production of coal by opening federal lands to coal leasing and extending the operating life of coal plants across the country. Later that month, he also added coal to his list of “critical minerals” and has used his “energy emergency” as an excuse to push through new mines.

Earlier this summer, Congress enacted a costly taxpayer subsidy for coal mining as part of its budget bill that cut health care and clean-energy investments. This attempt to prop up coal will come at the expense of people who have to pay higher electricity bills or question the reliability of their energy.

Coal’s decline was a problem of economics, and its revival only works if Americans are willing to pay more for less. By trying to bring back the coal industry, this administration is fighting the free markets that have shifted away from expensive and polluting coal plants in favor of cheaper, cleaner energy sources.

The Trump administration’s unwavering commitment to fossil fuels threatens to make energy costs higher for Americans while continuing to ignore solutions to energy independence.

The United States should let facts and economic realities take care of coal. What we need to focus on is affordable, abundant, and clean energy sources.",https://cdn.forumcomm.com/dims4/default/15fffd3/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1200x800+0+0/resize/1599x1066!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fforum-communications-production-web.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F46%2F46%2F80645c564a44b1b77c7cbb125c39%2F082525-op-dnt-sheatoon.jpg,N,,2025-08-24 16:01:43.771048

This includes permits from FERC and the Department of Energy, which strengthens its international appeal. In addition, companies such as JERA have also closed similar deals, increasing global interest in this strategic node.

For the execution of Phase 2, Sempra has entrusted Bechtel as the contractor responsible for design, procurement and construction. This alliance is intended to ensure the efficient delivery of the project, which is expected to start operations after the final investment decision scheduled for 2025.

Impact on the international gas market

This agreement represents a firm step towards the consolidation of U.S. LNG as a reliable source of energy for global markets. Both Sempra and ConocoPhillips agree on the importance of having a flexible and resilient supply network in a context of growing demand from allied economies.

ConocoPhillips has doubled its LNG purchases from Sempra's Port Arthur LNG project in Texas, increasing its annual purchase volume to 4 million tons. This move builds on the company's existing 5 million tons per year purchase from the facility's first phase. The expansion is aimed at meeting growing LNG demand in Asia and Europe [1].

The Port Arthur LNG Phase 2 development project, which is expected to include two additional liquefaction trains capable of producing about 13 Mtpa, is currently in the final stages of permitting. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission granted project approval in September 2023, followed by an export authorization from the U.S. Department of Energy in May 2025 [1]. Bechtel has been selected to deliver the engineering, procurement, and construction of the facility.

Sempra, a publicly traded energy infrastructure company, is developing the Port Arthur project and plans to make a final investment decision soon. The company is optimistic about the project's potential to drive economic growth and job creation in the region [2].

ConocoPhillips, an American multinational corporation, is one of the largest independent producers of oil and natural gas globally. The company's strategic partnership with Sempra Infrastructure reflects its commitment to building a flexible and reliable LNG supply network to meet growing energy demand [2].

The partnership between Sempra and ConocoPhillips is part of Sempra's broader strategy to expand its LNG franchise and unlock value for shareholders. The company's initiatives position it to drive future growth and deliver long-term value to consumers [2].

The projects are expected to be completed over the course of this year — just before federal tax incentives expire — and are said to mark America's largest rooftop solar installation to date.
According to REGlobal, rooftop solar installations have grown 10 times in size over the past decade, and there's plenty of room for further growth.
""We estimate that less than 5% of commercial and industrial roofs have solar on them,"" Shaun Keegan, chief executive of Solar Landscape, told the WSJ.
""One advantage of rooftop solar is that it's distributed, which can more easily support the grid in times of stress.","Solar technology firm SolarEdge and rooftop solar developer Solar Landscape are partnering to take advantage of a vast, untapped source of real estate: miles and miles of empty warehouse rooftops.

A recent Wall Street Journal exclusive announced this new collaboration, which aims to install 630 megawatts of solar capacity across more than 500 commercial and industrial rooftops across the U.S.

The projects are expected to be completed over the course of this year — just before federal tax incentives expire — and are said to mark America's largest rooftop solar installation to date.

""The U.S. is looking for more and more power. And this is one of the greatest ways to provide it. This is the quickest way to grid,"" Martin Rogers, U.S. general manager at SolarEdge, shared in the piece.

According to REGlobal, rooftop solar installations have grown 10 times in size over the past decade, and there's plenty of room for further growth.

It claimed that warehouses across the country have the potential to generate 185.6 terawatt-hours of solar-generated electricity annually, which could power 16% of all American homes, the report noted.

Solar power accounted for 69% of all new electricity-generating capacity in the U.S. during Q1 2025 and represented 10% year-over-year growth in the sector. However, this figure falls short of the average annual growth of 29% since 2015.

Solar Landscape's business model involves leasing rooftop space, developing and owning the solar system, and delivering energy back to the grid.

""We estimate that less than 5% of commercial and industrial roofs have solar on them,"" Shaun Keegan, chief executive of Solar Landscape, told the WSJ.

""It's a really underutilized area. We're talking million-square-foot warehouses — think 10 Walmarts put together,"" he noted, adding that ""leasing your roof can add 3% to 5% to the net operating income of a building.""

While Solar Landscape's projects can be tailored to offset the building's own energy costs, community solar is also part of their portfolio.

Nearby homeowners and renters can subscribe to get a part of these energy savings applied to their electricity bill without having to install their own system. These solar installations also improve the resilience of the local grid.

""One advantage of rooftop solar is that it's distributed, which can more easily support the grid in times of stress. Especially when combined with batteries that utilities can draw from,"" Joseph Osha, senior managing director and equity research analyst at Guggenheim Securities, told the outlet.

Households that prefer to add their own solar panel systems can bring their own electricity costs down to or near $0, although they should act quickly before the tax incentives expire on Dec. 31 of this year.

Free services like EnergySage can help interested consumers compare quotes from vetted installers and save up to $10,000 on their project.

An added benefit from having solar panels for your home is that it makes other money-saving electric appliances, such as heat pumps, more affordable to run.

Mitsubishi also offers a service that can help consumers find the best and affordable model for your specific needs.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/rooftop-solarimage-recs1Y2ZTlcNtUQRH.jpg,N,,2025-08-24 17:00:38.043678

The company’s ambitious $10 billion data center project in Richland Parish, announced late last year, promises to transform this rural enclave into a high-tech hub. But as construction hums along on a site spanning over 2,000 acres, the initiative is sparking debates about energy demands, economic trade-offs and the broader implications for America’s power grid.

Meta’s facility, slated for completion by 2030, is designed specifically for AI workloads, including training advanced models like its open-source Llama series. According to a detailed analysis in Fortune, the project requires an staggering 2 gigawatts of power—enough to supply electricity to about 1.6 million homes, rivaling the consumption of an entire state like Georgia. This voracious appetite for energy underscores a growing trend: Tech giants are fueling AI’s ascent with massive infrastructure builds that strain existing utilities and necessitate new power sources.

The Power Puzzle: Balancing AI Ambitions with Grid Realities

To meet these needs, Louisiana regulators recently approved a contentious energy plan from Entergy Louisiana, which includes $3 billion in investments for gas-fired plants, solar expansions and transmission upgrades. As reported by NOLA.com, the data center alone could consume three times the annual electricity of New Orleans, boosting Entergy’s statewide demand by 30%. Critics, including environmental groups, argue this reliance on fossil fuels could exacerbate climate challenges, while proponents highlight the plan’s inclusion of renewables as a step toward sustainability.

Yet, the approval process wasn’t without friction. Advocacy organizations disputed the arrangement, fearing higher power bills for residents. A piece in 404 Media described the facility as a “black hole of energy use,” with secretive details about consumer impacts fueling local anxiety. Posts on X from users in the region echo this sentiment, with some expressing concerns over rising costs and environmental strain amid the AI boom.

Economic Ripple Effects: Jobs Boom Meets Community Upheaval

On the economic front, the project is a windfall for Richland Parish, a community of fewer than 20,000 where poverty rates hover above the national average. Governor Jeff Landry hailed it as “a new chapter” for Louisiana, noting it’s the state’s largest private capital investment ever. Coverage from AP News details how construction has already created thousands of jobs, revitalizing local businesses from diners to hardware stores. Meta projects hundreds of permanent positions once operational, focusing on AI optimization and data management.

However, this influx isn’t without downsides. Longtime residents report skyrocketing housing prices and traffic congestion, altering the area’s pastoral charm. As CNBC explored, Louisiana offered substantial incentives—including tax breaks and infrastructure support—to lure Meta, raising questions about long-term value. Will the jobs offset the environmental and fiscal costs? Industry insiders point to similar builds in Texas and elsewhere, where AI-driven data centers demand up to 1.4 gigawatts, setting benchmarks for a $25 billion investment wave.

Broader Implications: AI’s Thirst for Resources Reshapes Rural America

This Louisiana endeavor exemplifies a national shift, where AI’s computational hunger is prompting a rethinking of energy infrastructure. A commentary in The Georgia Star News warns of “promise and peril,” noting how such projects could strain water and power resources in underserved areas. Meta’s move, as per posts on X from tech watchers, positions Louisiana as a template for grid expansions nationwide, potentially accelerating fossil fuel use even as clean energy goals loom.

For industry leaders, the stakes are high: Success here could validate massive AI investments, but failures in energy management might invite regulatory scrutiny. As one X user noted in discussions around the project’s scale, the data center’s power draw rivals major urban centers, highlighting AI’s role in reshaping not just technology, but the very fabric of rural economies and national energy policy. With construction advancing rapidly, Richland Parish stands at the forefront of this transformation, a microcosm of the tensions between innovation and sustainability.",https://www.webpronews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/xai-tmp-imgen-2150983e-1031-455b-a7eb-0f7a4381649c.jpeg,N,,2025-08-24 15:05:35.987006

Numerous servile commentators in Russia repeat the thesis that Trump needs a peace deal now more than Putin.","US President Donald Trump let more deadlines to impose crushing sanctions and tariffs on Russia to end the war in Ukraine slide yet again. The reason might be that he is still hoping to sign off on multi-billion-dollar business deals with the Kremlin.

The latest was an August 8 deadline to halt hostilities or face 100% duties and secondary sanctions on Russia crude oil customers if Russian President Vladimir Putin did not call a ceasefire. But that deadline was abandoned after the Kremlin agreed to the Alaska summit on August 15. India did get an additional 25% of duties for trading with Russia, but China, the other major purchaser of Russian crude, was given a stay of execution until November. Trump has since threatened to return to the sanctions idea, but at the weekend, he was giving the Kremlin another two weeks of time, pushing the new deadline into the middle of September.

During the various rounds of talks, most of the comments coming out of the meetings have pertained to POW swaps and the potential for a ceasefire, but in the background it has been clear there is a parallel track of unvocalised talks about business. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said at the very start of the process in Riyadh in February that there was a “historic opportunity” to do business with Russia, a sentiment echoed by Kirill Dmitriev, the head of Russia’s sovereign wealth fund, who has participated in all the meetings and said in Riyadh that he was leading a “parallel track” of negotiations with America on doing deals.

ExxonMobil invited back to Sakhalin

Putin has alluded to restarting commercial relations on several occasions. He has ordered the government to draw up rules for international companies that want to return to the Russian market. He also offered Trump to launch joint ventures to exploit Russia’s vast reserves of critical minerals and rare earth metals (REMs), as well as suggesting the US invest in Russia’s development of the huge oil and gas deposits in the Arctic. Likewise, ahead of the Alaska summit Trump suggested that Russia and the US jointly develop the mineral deposits in Alaska.

Now things have taken a concrete step forward. Putin signed a decree allowing ExxonMobil to potentially return to the Sakhalin-1 oil project, opening the door for renewed US-Russia energy cooperation days before the start of the Alaska summit on August 15. ExxonMobil pulled off the project shortly after the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, booking hundreds of millions of dollars of losses as a result.

The decree could enable ExxonMobil, the largest US oil company, to re-enter the venture as a shareholder with a 30% stake. While Sakhalin-1 is not subject to formal Western sanctions, ExxonMobil pulled out and its stake was subsequently transferred to a Russian operator, as the company made no public effort to retain its interest.

Moscow and Washington are now in talks over potential cooperation on natural gas projects in both Russia’s Arctic zone and the US state of Alaska, according to Putin.

Restarting cooperation with the US is also key for developing Russia’s LNG business in the Arctic, led by privately owned firm Novatek. The company has built a liquification plant and is actively exporting LNG, but its Arctic LNG-2 expansion has been stymied by sanctions that prevent it buying critical technology, almost exclusively made by US companies. Speaking at a meeting with nuclear industry workers in Sarov on August 23, Putin highlighted the growing role of Russian energy companies in LNG.

“We have several companies, namely the Novatek company, which is one of our big companies working in the field of natural gas liquefaction,” he said.

Putin stressed that Novatek already works “in cooperation with many partners, both European and Asian ones,” and suggested the scope for expanding such collaboration across the Atlantic. “By the way, we are discussing with our American partners the possibility of working together in this field, not only in our Arctic zone but also in Alaska,” the president added.

The Russian leader underlined that Moscow possesses advanced capabilities in LNG production that could attract interest abroad, without adding that attempts to replace US technology with Chinese analogues has proven a miserable failure.

“Russia currently has unique technologies in this field, which are of interest to Russian partners, including in the United States,” he noted.

Pointing to longer-term prospects, Putin said: “The Arctic zone, the Northern Sea Route and your work there have great prospects, and they are developing at a very good pace.”

The meeting between Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump in Alaska made possible not only the prospect of a peace agreement on Ukraine, but also the possibility of easing sanctions pressure on Russia. So far, Trump has largely backed Putin’s demands, both in the seven-point “final offer” peace plan in April that also contained demands for significant sanctions relief for Russia – a demand the European partners balked at – and a very similar list of demands Trump demanded from Ukraine following the Alaska meeting this month.

Trump's sanctions policy and Russian wishes

The Trump administration has been extremely aggressive even with its nominal closest allies like Canada and the EU, but pointedly has left Russia almost entirely alone. Since he took office, Trump has effectively cut all military and financial support for Ukraine and imposed no new sanctions on Russia whatsoever. During the Liberation Day duties announcements, Russia was almost unique in that it received duties of 0%, whereas the least anyone else got was 10%.

Trump talks tough on Russia, but has repeatedly failed to follow through with action. He said in January, March, and May of this year that he was ready to introduce tough sanctions against Russia, but his administration has yet to introduce any significant restrictions. In July, Trump gave Russia an ultimatum, first for 50 days, then shortening it to ten, threatening to introduce prohibitive duties on goods from countries that buy Russian oil. However, nothing has happened.

After the meeting in Alaska, in response to a question about sanctions on an evening program on Fox News on August 21, Trump said: ""We don't have to think about it yet."" And Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who is considered the main anti-Russian hawk in the White House, in several interviews over the past week effectively called sanctions an obstacle to concluding a peace treaty and made it clear that the administration will wait with restrictions until there is no hope for peace.

The discussion of new sanctions may resume in September, when the Senate returns from summer recess. “If things don’t move in the right direction before we get back to work, I think we’ll have to go to Plan B,” the sponsor of a previous bill to impose 500% duties on Russia’s trading allies, Senator Lindsey Graham, told AP last week. But Graham, one of the senators closest to Trump, has always stressed that the bill must first be approved by the president. The Senate returns from recess in the first week of September.

This approach gives the Kremlin an obvious strategy, Alexander Kolyandr, a visiting research fellow at the Center for European Policy Analysis (CEPA), wrote in The Bell: drag out the negotiations as long as possible, not agreeing to anything for a long time, and continue both the dialogue with the White House and the military assault in Ukraine. Numerous servile commentators in Russia repeat the thesis that Trump needs a peace deal now more than Putin. If this is a reflection of the Kremlin’s views, then at some point it may begin to demand a relaxation of the sanctions regime in order to continue negotiations.

The official Russian position on sanctions remains maximalist — all restrictions are illegal and must be lifted. The real minimum acceptable option, as sources in Moscow told The Bell, consists of three main parts: lifting restrictions on oil exports, allowing at least one major state bank to open correspondent accounts in the US to facilitate cross-border payments, and opening up exports of aircraft, aircraft parts, and some other industrial equipment.

Will foreign investors return to Russia if sanctions are lifted? Following the default of 1998 western investors were so badly burnt that it took nearly five years for the stock market to recover to where it was just before the default and devaluation of that year. Clearly if sanctions are lifted by Trump, it will still take years for Russia’s investment climate to recover.

Despite Putin’s orders to prepare the way for foreign investors’ return to the Russian market, all investors interviewed by The Bell confirm that no one is discussing the possibility of returning to Russia even if peace comes.",https://d39raawggeifpx.cloudfront.net/styles/16_9_desktop/s3/articleimages/bneGeneric_Russia_Sakhalin_Far_East_sea_beach_Image_Michail_Dementiev_Unsplash___Cropped_0.jpg,N,,2025-08-24 15:05:05.617733

The BBI targets key areas, including stationary energy storage and the production of battery active materials using Australia’s energy and critical mineral resources. It supports the manufacture of cathode materials, anode materials, electrolytes, battery cells, components, and battery pack assembly. The initiative aligns with the National Battery Strategy, part of the AUD 22.7 billion Future Made in Australia policy, which emphasizes opportunities in stationary storage, mineral processing, battery research, and transport sector applications.

Federal Industry Minister Tim Ayres stated: “Batteries are a critical component of the global move to reduce carbon emissions and there is a huge opportunity for Australia to be part of this global demand. Australia’s got the raw materials, a strong research sector and a range of companies deeply engaged on the role of batteries in the clean energy transition, and that’s why I’m so excited to back these home-grown ideas and businesses.”

ARENA Chief Executive Officer Darren Miller said: “BBI will enhance Australia’s battery manufacturing capability, improve supply chain resilience and battery manufacturing processes, and foster innovation.” The program will identify opportunities to develop skills and capabilities, enabling Australian businesses to scale operations across the battery value chain.

Funding will be provided through capital grants, production incentives, or other appropriate payments, remaining available until fully allocated. The initiative encourages innovation in battery production, leveraging Australia’s abundant raw materials and research expertise to meet growing global demand for sustainable energy solutions.

By supporting projects that enhance supply chain resilience and manufacturing processes, the BBI aims to establish Australia as a leader in the battery industry. The program fosters collaboration between businesses and research institutions, driving advancements in battery technology for both stationary and transport applications. This effort supports Australia’s broader commitment to reducing carbon emissions and transitioning to a clean energy future.

The BBI represents a significant step in building a robust domestic battery sector, capitalizing on Australia’s resources and expertise to meet global market needs while advancing sustainable energy goals.",,N,,2025-08-24 15:04:24.594106

Executive Director Ryan Mooney-Bullock says Green Umbrella will soon be able to install new insulation and updated HVAC systems into the apartments.

“There's a lot of assumptions that have been made about what will happen when you make these types of improvements within housing units, but there have not actually been studies that have really shown through the entire process, what does this feel like? What do the residents of these units experience?” Mooney-Bullock said.

Green Umbrella, along with researchers from Indiana University, Carnegie Mellon University, and the University of Pennsylvania, also is surveying residents to gain insight into those questions.

Mooney-Bullock says she hopes their findings can help households across the country reduce their energy bills and consumption.

“As we seek to move forward with lower energy use and green sources of energy — not just for the folks who can afford solar panels on their houses, but people who are living in all types of housing — we knew it was really important information that we wanted to be able to continue to study,” Mooney-Bullock said.

Green Umbrella plans to share the study publicly once it is complete.

The nonprofit received a $1.1 million award from the Environmental Protection Agency in 2023 for the energy study. In May, Green Umbrella learned its grant had been terminated because it is “no longer in alignment with the EPA’s priorities.”

The nonprofit disputed the termination with the EPA, but says it hasn’t heard anything back yet.

Where you live has significant impact on your health.

Rebuilding Together, a nonprofit that repairs homes at no cost, has launched Home Sick, an initiative which addresses health concerns related to housing conditions.

“Our program is really about people who just want to be able to stay in their community, in their home, and maintain that when it’s increasingly out of reach financially, particularly with higher property taxes,” said executive director of Rebuilding Together Greater Charlotte, Beth Morrison.

Many people served by Rebuilding Together are often Black women above the age of 60, with an average income of $30,000 a year. The average cost of a home repair is $25,000.

One of their initiatives, Building a Healthy Neighborhood, has made adjustment in areas with concentrations of homes needing more repairs, like Pottstown in Huntersville and Hidden Valley in Charlotte. In some cases, community leaders have reached out to Rebuilding Together for partnership.

These are areas that are being targeted by rapid investment in previously disinvested neighborhoods, creating the threat of code enforcement violations. Morrison said lots of people tend to be suspicious about costly repairs being done on their homes for no cost, especially when government is involved.

Older houses, particularly those built before 1978, may have a higher risk of having lead paint, asbestos, older HVAC systems that require pricy upgrades, which are threatening to the health of young children and pregnant people. The average repair for an HVAC system, Morrison said, is around $10,000.

Morrison said that about 40% of juvenile asthma cases are caused by the home they live in. One of the major repairs Rebuilding Together does is replacing old carpeting which has trapped years of dust and pet dander with vinyl planks.

“Environmental triggers in the home for respiratory illness, like people smoking in the home; pest infestations are a major one, having good air quality control, having a good HVC system and changing your air filters often,” Morrison said.

As homeowners age, mobility and accessibility needs can change, said Beth Morrison, Rebuilding Together’s director. Additions like walk-in showers, safety bars, wheelchair ramps, and levers for door handles can make homes more accessible.

“Just think about wanting to bathe yourself independently,” she said. “Many people can’t do that without a costly home health aide, or a family member having to help them physically get in and out of the bathtub.”

Widening doorways, adding lighting, and bathroom modifications are also a part of their work.

“There’s a lot of ways that somebody’s environment is more challenging because of their own health and mobility, but there re sometimes when the home is actually making them sick,” Morrison said.

Rebuilding Together, a licensed general contractor with repair, renovation and painting certification from the Environmental Protection Agency, is taking applications for projects in the Hampshire Hills and Eastwood Acres neighborhoods. The nonprofit partners with donors like Bank of America, Bed Bath & Beyond, Home Depot, LG, Foundation for the Carolinas, as well as Mecklenburg County and city of Charlotte.

Morrison says the city and the county have been “laser-focused” on working with Rebuilding Together to preserve the stock of older, more affordable homes. Beginning in September, the organization will launch basic home maintenance workshops for homeowners to know about things to look out for before they become more serious and expensive home improvement projects.

In the future, Rebuilding Together is looking into ways to improve rental properties without giving capital to “slumlords,” Morrison said. The need for repairs coupled with higher costs may cause homeowners to lose housing that has been in their family for generations, robbing them of the opportunity to pass along wealth. In this way, Morrison said Rebuilding Together is also homelessness prevention.

“The most affordable home is the home somebody already lives in,” she said. “So, if we can work to preserve existing affordable housing stock by making these investments so that they can live in their homes longer, it’s lessening the burden on how many new units we need to build as community.…

“We could repair maybe 10 to 15 homes for the price of building a new home, and that’s for major repairs.”

With 539 active rigs as of August 22, 2025, the industry faces a stark reality: exploration and production (E&P) firms are outperforming energy equipment and services (EES) players in a low-rig environment. This divergence highlights a critical inflection point for investors, where strategic positioning between resilient E&P operators and vulnerable EES providers could determine long-term returns.

The E&P Resilience Play

Despite the 15-week rig decline, E&P companies are defying expectations. Natural gas production hit a record 106.7 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d) in August 2025, driven by efficiency gains and disciplined inventory management. Producers like Coterra Energy and CNX Resources have leveraged reduced drilled-but-uncompleted (DUC) well inventories to boost output without increasing rig counts. For example, Appalachia's DUCs dropped by 60 from January to July, while Haynesville producers cut 25 DUCs in the same period. These optimizations have allowed E&Ps to maintain production growth even as rigs decline.

The key to E&P resilience lies in their ability to prioritize capital discipline. Companies such as Expand Energy and National Fuel Gas have raised production guidance for 2026, citing improved well performance and cost controls. This focus on efficiency—rather than sheer rig count—has enabled E&Ps to navigate weak commodity prices. For instance, Texas's oil rig count fell 65% from 2014 to 2024, yet production rose 94%, thanks to advancements in horizontal drilling and fracking.

The EES Vulnerability

Conversely, EES firms are struggling to adapt to the prolonged rig decline. With U.S. oil rigs down 46 from the same period in 2024 and gas rigs facing similar pressures, demand for drilling services has plummeted. Companies like Halliburton and Schlumberger are seeing reduced contract volumes, particularly in the Permian Basin, where rig counts have fallen to 251 as of August 2025—the lowest since 2021.

The EES sector's reliance on cyclical rig activity makes it inherently vulnerable in a low-demand environment. While E&P firms can pivot to optimize existing assets, EES providers lack the flexibility to offset declining rig counts. This is evident in the sector's underperformance relative to E&Ps, as illustrated by the stark contrast in stock price trajectories over the past three years.

Strategic Investment Insights

For investors, the energy sector's rebalancing presents a clear opportunity: lean into E&P firms with strong balance sheets and operational efficiency, while approaching EES providers with caution. Here's how to position a portfolio:

Prioritize E&P Resilience:

Target companies with low DUC inventories and high well productivity, such as Coterra Energy (CTRA) and Expand Energy (XEC).

Favor firms with robust shareholder return programs, like National Fuel Gas (NFG), which has raised dividends and production guidance.

Monitor E&P guidance updates for 2026, as companies like CNX Resources (CNX) demonstrate confidence in growth despite rig declines.

Avoid EES Overexposure:

EES firms remain at risk until rig counts stabilize. However, consider selective plays in niche areas like digital oilfield services, where demand for efficiency tools is rising.

Watch for EES companies with diversified revenue streams or strong cash reserves to weather the downturn.

Leverage Sector Rotation:

Use the E&P-EES divergence to hedge portfolios. For every EES holding, balance with a high-margin E&P play.

Reallocate capital to E&Ps that are outperforming in production growth while maintaining disciplined capital expenditures.

The Road Ahead

The U.S. rig count's 15-week decline underscores a structural shift in the energy sector. E&P firms are proving that production growth is achievable through efficiency, not just scale. Meanwhile, EES players face a prolonged period of adjustment. For investors, the lesson is clear: align with the winners of this rebalancing—companies that turn constraints into competitive advantages.

As the EIA forecasts continued rig count declines into 2026, the energy sector's next chapter will be defined by those who adapt.

Last Updated on:

There they go again. The clown car that used to be known as the US government has brought its oversized shoes down upon the US offshore wind industry once again. This time the victim is the Revolution Wind project off the coast of Rhode Island, brought to a screeching halt by order of the Interior Department even though it is already 80% complete. Connecticut is also impacted because it is a partner in the project. And, once again, a proposed multistate gas pipeline is lurking in the background.

Nice Offshore Wind Project You Have There …

The Revolution stop-work order takes note of unspecified security concerns, which sounds rather mysterious if not downright sketchy. For some insights into the reasons for taking such an extreme measure, let’s take a quick look at the stop-work order that froze the Empire Wind project in New York State earlier this year. Empire is a project of the Norwegian diversified energy firm Equinor, and work was already well underway when the Interior Department brought the hammer down in April.

The freeze was a temporary one. According to multiple reports, New York State Governor Kathy Hochul struck a bargain with the White House, and the proposed Constitution gas pipeline was among the bargaining chips. Equinor’s status as a leading US oil and gas producer may have also factored into the de-freeze. As of this writing, work on Empire Wind is proceeding apace.

As for the Constitution pipeline, it was first proposed by the firm Williams in 2014 with the aim of bringing gas from Pennsylvania into New York State, to connect with offtakers in New England. State environmental officials redlighted the project in 2016, but Williams hung in there for a few more years before officially dropping the proposal in 2020. Now, suddenly, here it comes again, magically brought back to life.

Williams has other projects in the works throughout the US, and the benefits of the new pipeline to consumers in New England are unclear. However, for reasons best known only to Williams, the Constitution pipeline is reportedly on the fast track to approval.

… Shame If Anything Should Happen To It …

The Revolution Wind stop-work order could be a temporary one as well. Though, that remains to be seen. Its developer, the Danish firm Ørsted, does not have US oil and gas investments to bargain with.

However, there is a pipeline involved, and that’s where the Trump administration could apply some pressure on state officials in Rhode Island and Connecticut.

The pipeline in question is Project Maple. It comes under the umbrella of the Canadian firm Enbridge. As described in a letter of opposition signed by dozens of environmental groups and community organizations in the region, Project Maple is a rebrand of the former Access Northeast project, in which Enbridge proposed another in a series of expansions on its existing, 1,100-mile Algonquin Gas Transmission Pipeline from Pennsylvania to points east.

Enbridge mothballed Access Northeast back in 2017, but the project found its legs again in the form of Project Maple, shortly after the results rolled in from the 2024 Presidential election cycle.

“Enbridge wants to expand its 1,100-mile-long natural gas pipeline system, the Algonquin Gas Transmission Pipeline,” the Conservation Law Foundation noted in an update on April 18.

“This system runs from New Jersey through New York and into Rhode Island, Connecticut, and Massachusetts,” CLF elaborated. “While the details are vague because this proposal is still in its early stages, we do know that Enbridge wants to replace existing pipelines, add new secondary pipelines, and expand compressor stations throughout the system’s route.”

The Tangled Web Of US Pipelines

If you have reason to believe that Project Maple is the end game of the Revolution Wind stop-work order, drop a note in the comment thread. Before you do, though, consider that Enbridge is a Canadian company. Relations between the Trump administration and Canadian companies have become rather frayed of late, to put it mildly.

Be that as it may, Pennsylvania is the nation’s second-largest producer of natural gas, and US-based gas producers that operate in Pennsylvania have an interest in seeing Project Maple spread its branches.

Besides, Enbridge is a pipeline owner and operator, not a construction firm. When Enbridge sets pipeline work in motion, the hands-on tasks are handled by the pipeline construction people, and that’s where things get interesting. Take a look over at Michigan, for example, where Enbridge seeks to replace its Line 5 oil and gas pipeline. The contractor on the project is the firm Barnard Construction, which is known for its billion-dollar work on Trump’s border wall. The Guardian is among the news organizations to pick up the Line 5 thread earlier this year.

“Donald Trump’s administration is being accused by activists of a quid pro quo as it attempts to fast-track a controversial fossil fuel pipeline proposal in Michigan that would in part be built by a donor with deep financial ties to the president,” The Guardian noted in March, adding that “the contractor is Tim Barnard, who, along with his wife, gave $1m to Trump’s campaign last year.”

Of course, this doesn’t mean that similar monkey business is afoot at Project Maple. It simply means that Enbridge does not appear to have suffered any political fallout from the hostilities sparked by the Trump administration’s tariff wars, at least for the time being.

Next Steps For The US Offshore Wind Industry

As for the US offshore wind industry, practically every state on the Eastern seaboard from Maine down to North Carolina has been banking on offshore wind to meet climate goals, stabilize fuel costs, and reduce their dependence on oil and gas shipped in from points west.

Now the whole industry is in jeopardy as the Trump administration puts the squeeze on the entire federal offshore lease program at one end, while monkey-wrenching Revolution Wind and other projects that have already started construction. States in “real America” are feeling the pain as well. Offshore wind advocates like to point out that offshore wind farms are vast, complicated infrastructure projects that create thousands of manufacturing jobs all over the US as well as portside jobs in their home states.

The deep red state of Louisiana, for example, lent its offshore oil and gas expertise to construct the nation’s very first offshore wind farm in the US almost 10 years ago, and Louisiana businesses continued to make major contributions to the industry on through this year.

Whelp, kiss that goodbye. It was only last year that Ørsted and the Louisiana shipbuilder Edison Chouest Offshore celebrated the launch of the first purpose-built offshore wind construction vessel made in the USA, the ECO Edison. That could be the last one Edison ever builds for the US market.

Meanwhile, Ørsted has complied with the stop-work order and is examining its options. Connecticut Governor Ned Lamont and Rhode Island Governor Dan McKee — both Democrats — have vowed to save the project. Perhaps they should take a look over at Virginia, where the Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind project is chugging merrily along, wrapped securely in the security blanket of support from Republican Governor Glenn Youngkin — for now.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Revolution-offshore-wind-turbine-Orsted.png,N,,2025-08-24 13:03:31.564040

The idea isn’t new; Experts have warned that the U.S. power grid could face critical stress in the future. The idea isn’t new. An 1956 report stated the country’s electricity infrastructure was being pushed to its limits. At the time, it was mostly theoretical—a cautionary tale for engineers and policymakers. However, the warning stayed within the industry, quietly shaping how energy systems were built.

Past concern in a new format: Technology is consuming energy

Recently, that concern has gained new urgency. America’s demand for electricity is bigger than ever, and the grid is facing pressures that weren’t anticipated decades ago. High consumption is changing industrial needs and how engineers operate – as well as the rapid adoption of emerging technologies, which are all converging. The question is no longer if strain will occur—it’s what will happen when it does. It’s just a matter of time now.

Across key regions, energy planners and utility companies are closely tracking the situation. New infrastructure projects, operational decisions, and energy strategies are all being reconsidered in real-time. And soon, what has been theoretical for nearly 70 years could manifest in a way the country hasn’t seen before.

Are data centers destroying the energy grid in the U.S.?

Tech companies are selling a future where AI tells you what to do on a daily basis. What to wear, where to go, and how to spend your free time. Meanwhile, the cost of all that processing power is finally hitting consumers, as electricity prices rise across the country while the grid struggles to handle the surge in demand.

According to Newsweek, energy use from data centers contributed to a 6.5% increase in electricity prices from May 2024 to May 2025. Some states saw far higher jumps: Connecticut and Maine reported 18.4% and 36.3% increases, respectively. And as tech companies expand their AI infrastructure, those numbers are expected to climb even higher.

Utilities are trying to keep up by relying on old fossil fuel plants, but the solution is far from simple. Dominion Energy, which serves much of Virginia, has asked regulators to make large consumers of electricity cover a bigger share of the cost for upgrading the grid. Without changes, electricity prices in some parts of Virginia could rise by as much as 25% by 2030.

Artificial Intelligence might not be the solution

Improving AI efficiency isn’t likely to solve the problem, either. AI systems constantly pull in vast amounts of data to function, and that nonstop processing requires more and more electricity. Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory’s 2024 report for the U.S. Department of Energy found that data center energy use has been growing steadily and could account for 6.7% to 12% of U.S. electricity consumption by 2028.

That’s on top of the energy needed to power electric vehicles, domestic manufacturing, hydrogen technology, and industrial electrification—leaving the grid under immense strain. It’s not just a matter of unplugging these data centers. Their backup power systems create headaches of their own. Reuters reports that the rapid growth of data centers—driven by AI and crypto mining—forces grid operators to plan for new contingencies, making the already tricky task of balancing electricity supply and demand even harder.

Consequences of leaving next to the data centers: It consumes everything around

Even when blackouts are avoided, living near these power-hungry facilities isn’t without consequences. Residents can experience shorter lifespans for electrical appliances, which can overheat or fail, and in some cases even cause fires. On top of that, there’s air, noise, and light pollution—making it one of the rare cases where a “not in my backyard” attitude might actually make sense.

The loss of the federal $7,500 EV tax credit this fall will be another drag. Those are real headwinds, but they don't take away from the progress that Rivian has been making.

Building out a profitable EV business is not easy, with even major automakers often struggling to sell their EV models for a profit. However, Rivian took a big step in this direction when it switched to a zonal architecture. This slashed the number of electronic control units and wiring in its vehicles, making its SUVs cheaper to build. It also helped the company secure a major partnership with Volkswagen, which opened up its checkbook to gain access to the technology and form a joint venture.

The next big step for Rivian will be launching its new, smaller R2 SUV next year. At a starting price of around $45,000, it will target a much broader audience than the R1 luxury line, which costs over $100,000 for some versions. Importantly, Rivian has locked in costs through supplier contracts and expects the R2 to deliver stronger margins through lower material costs, higher volumes, and shared fixed expenses with its R1 and electric delivery van lines.

On the financial front, Rivian is backed by Amazon, which uses its delivery vans, and it still has more cash coming from Volkswagen if and when certain milestones are reached. It has also secured a $6.6 billion loan from the Department of Energy to help build a second U.S. plant. With $7.5 billion in cash and short-term investments, the company has plenty of capital to support the R2 launch. Management is targeting earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) breakeven by 2027, which seems like a realistic timeline if the R2 is successful.

Rivian is still a high-risk name, but it has the balance sheet, the partners, and the right vehicle strategy to grow into a profitable business.

Tesla is losing momentum

Tesla's core auto business has been heading in the wrong direction. Deliveries dropped double digits in each of the past two quarters, while auto revenue slid 16% in Q2. Profitability and cash flow have also taken a hit. Adjusted EPS dropped 23% last quarter, while operating cash flow fell 30% and free cash flow collapsed to just $146 million.

Meanwhile, its high gross margin regulatory credit sales were cut by more than half during the quarter. Musk has already warned investors that things could get worse once the EV tax credit disappears later this year.

Rather than focusing on improving its ailing auto business, Musk has instead continued to try to sell investors on Tesla's autonomous driving and robotics ambitions. The company has launched a small pilot robotaxi program in Austin, Texas, but the service is limited to a geofenced area and requires a Tesla employee as a safety driver. It's also already drawn scrutiny from local officials after several safety incidents.

Tesla is promising a rapid rollout of robotaxis across half the U.S. by year-end pending regulatory approvals, but the technology does not appear ready. Its decision to eschew lidar technology and use a camera-only approach remains controversial. This design saves costs, but the technology has struggled in some complex driving conditions, leading to questions around the safety of its approach. By comparison, Alphabet's Waymo robotaxi is far ahead, with years of experience operating paid, driverless rides in multiple cities.

Which EV stock wins?

Both Tesla and Rivian stocks carry their fair share of risk. Rivian is still unprofitable and faces near-term headwinds from tariffs and the loss of EV tax credits. Tesla, however, has a weakening auto business, a valuation that assumes big success in robotaxis and robotics, and a CEO whose actions have hurt the brand with many consumers.

Between the two, Rivian looks like the better investment. The company is improving its cost structure, expanding its market with the R2 SUV, and has the support of well-financed partners to help fund its growth. Tesla's stock, by contrast, is still priced as if its autonomous driving and robotics bets will pay off, even though it has yet to prove they can.

For investors willing to take on risk, Rivian is the better EV stock to own in my view.

However, one of the individuals didn't quite cover their face in time, allowing the Tesla owner to get a decent identifying image.

Unfortunately, this isn't the only time a Tesla driver has caught someone in the act. People have been filmed purposefully scratching a vehicle's bodywork, while another has been caught throwing things towards a moving Tesla.

Tesla's — and electric cars in general — offer numerous benefits to vehicle owners, but some people just haven't gotten the memo. EVs are much cheaper to refuel, require less maintenance thanks to fewer moving parts, and do not produce any planet-warming emissions when on the move.

Even when considering the environmentally damaging mining required to extract precious metals for battery construction, this activity is still better than the vast drilling and extraction of dirty fuels needed to power internal combustion engine cars.

But actions like the ones detailed here discourage people from making their next car an EV. We have to reduce the planet-warming emissions produced by the vehicle sector, which make up 28% of the total warming gases produced by the United States, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. Moving away from gas-guzzling cars is one way to do so.

In other words, contrary to Zeldin’s assertion, it is actually the Trump administration that is twisting or ignoring the law and public sentiment and warping science.
Zeldin’s endangerment finding rescission also seems to be untenable in the court of public opinion.
EPA held virtual public hearings last week on its proposal, and almost everyone who testified spoke in opposition to eliminating the endangerment finding.
“Repealing environmental protections and rescinding [the endangerment] finding will make stories like mine more common,” Lyttle said.","When US Environmental Protection Agency, or EPA, Administrator Lee Zeldin announced last month his official proposal to rescind the agency’s foundational determination that greenhouse gas emissions endanger human health and welfare, he insinuated that previous administrations (under former Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden) had “twisted the law, ignored precedent, and warped science” in order to achieve their regulatory agendas. And the regulations of these planet-warming emissions, not the emissions themselves like carbon dioxide, are “the real threat to Americans’ livelihoods,” Zeldin suggested.

EPA’s greenhouse gas endangerment finding, established in 2009, serves as the basis of its legal obligation under the Clean Air Act to regulate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from sources such as motor vehicles and power plants. The finding was based on an extensive review of the scientific record, which has gotten even more robust over the last 16 years, and has survived all legal challenges brought against it.

The Trump administration’s move to do away with the finding contradicts the overwhelming scientific evidence that greenhouse gas emissions are driving dangerous climate change impacts. There are also arguments to be made that it is unlawful. And, it goes against the pleas of the hundreds of Americans who have spoken out this week in opposition to Zeldin’s sweeping deregulatory proposal. In other words, contrary to Zeldin’s assertion, it is actually the Trump administration that is twisting or ignoring the law and public sentiment and warping science.

Let’s start with the science. The world’s premier body of climate scientists—the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change—has stated that it is “unequivocal” that human activities are warming the planet and causing rapid and widespread changes, such as more extreme weather, that are unprecedented over millennia. The US Fifth National Climate Assessment report observes that “harmful impacts from more frequent and severe extremes are increasing across the country” and notes that “climate changes are making it harder to maintain safe homes and healthy families; reliable public services; a sustainable economy; thriving ecosystems, cultures, and traditions; and strong communities.” These are authoritative statements from reports involving hundreds of scientists and extensive peer review.

What the Trump administration is doing with repealing the endangerment finding and all GHG regulations that flow from it, therefore, could be a violation of international law under the ICJ’s recent advisory opinion.

But to support its proposal to rescind the endangerment finding, Trump’s EPA relies instead on a new report issued by the Department of Energy (DOE) that rejects the scientific consensus on climate change and claims that GHG emissions and climate impacts are not harmful. The report, hastily written by five climate skeptics over a period of just two months, recycles many climate denialist talking points and, according to one analysis, includes over 100 false or misleading statements. As science historian Naomi Oreskes puts it, “Climate denial is now the official policy of the US government.”

“What the Trump administration and the Department of Energy did is pull together this small hand-picked group of people to work in secret to write this report that questions that mountain of scientific evidence that climate change is harming people,” said Erin Murphy, a senior attorney at Environmental Defense Fund (EDF).

“In and of itself, the conclusions of that report are inaccurate and inconsistent with the vast, vast majority of scientific findings and the consensus across the scientific community,” she added. “But also, the report is inconsistent with federal law.”

EDF and the Union of Concerned Scientists have filed a lawsuit against the DOE, the EPA, and the group of five climate skeptics arguing that the secretive manner in which the report was pulled together violates the Federal Advisory Committee Act, which mandates transparency and opportunities for public engagement in government advisory proceedings.

The report has not gone through formal peer review, and although it is currently open to public comment, the time window for commenting is limited to just 30 days (closing on September 2) during a month when many people take vacations or might otherwise be unavailable. And until this week, none of the hundreds of comments that have come in were publicly visible. That hiding of the comments, Murphy said, “further underscores the government’s efforts to do this in secret.”

The lawsuit aims to block the Trump administration from using this report in its efforts to rescind the endangerment finding.

It was clear to me that the speakers—from environmental groups, the medical community and scientists to municipal and state governments and private citizens—were overwhelmingly united in their disapproval of the nixing of EPA’s foundational finding that GHG emissions endanger our health and welfare.

Even if EPA plows ahead and finalizes its move to eliminate the finding, that action will certainly be challenged in court. It remains to be seen what legal arguments environmental groups and other challengers will put forth.

One thing that is clear is that climate action is no longer optional, but rather a legal obligation, as several international courts have affirmed in recent landmark climate change advisory opinions. The International Court of Justice, considered the world’s highest court, delivered its opinion on July 23. The ICJ clarified that states have obligations under multiple sources of international law to reduce emissions and that governments must regulate the emissions of private actors. The customary law duty to prevent significant environmental harm to the climate system, which applies to all countries regardless of whether they are parties to specific treaties, includes putting in place “regulatory mitigation mechanisms” to reduce GHG emissions, the court said. Such rules “must regulate the conduct of public and private operators.” According to the court, failure to act in good faith to regulate emissions could be considered an unlawful act.

What the Trump administration is doing with repealing the endangerment finding and all GHG regulations that flow from it, therefore, could be a violation of international law under the ICJ’s recent advisory opinion. And while the opinion itself is nonbinding, it may be invoked in domestic court proceedings around the world, including in the US.

Zeldin’s endangerment finding rescission also seems to be untenable in the court of public opinion. “In repealing the endangerment finding, the Trump administration is stepping far out of line with public opinion, as voters across partisanship are in strong agreement that greenhouse gas emissions are a threat to public health and should be regulated,” Data for Progress says in reference to new poll results it released last week.

EPA held virtual public hearings last week on its proposal, and almost everyone who testified spoke in opposition to eliminating the endangerment finding. Out of the roughly 200 people who spoke on Tuesday, fewer than 10 voiced support for EPA’s rollback, Inside Climate News reports. I tuned into some of the hearings on Wednesday and Thursday, and it was clear to me that the speakers—from environmental groups, the medical community and scientists to municipal and state governments and private citizens—were overwhelmingly united in their disapproval of the nixing of EPA’s foundational finding that GHG emissions endanger our health and welfare.

“The EPA has a responsibility to regulate greenhouse gases for what they are—a clear, present, and growing threat to the health and well-being of every American,” Kim Cobb, a climate scientist, told the EPA panel in concluding her testimony.

Tiffany Covarrubias Lyttle, a registered nurse and mother of seven children, said during her testimony that the father of her children recently passed away from cancer, specially an environmentally triggered adenocarcinoma.

The warehouse giant, which is famous for bulk bargains and $1.99 pizza slices, has started testing fast charging stalls at its North Port, Florida store.

The project is a collaboration with Electric Era, a startup founded by former SpaceX engineers, and it could turn a weekly Costco run into a weekly recharge.

If the pilot proves successful, it might set the stage for a nationwide rollout that changes how millions of Americans shop and power their cars.

Fast EV charging while you shop

Electric Era’s six new stalls went up in just 54 days, and they’re nothing like the slow Level 2 chargers that can take all day to top up a car.

Instead, these are fast chargers capable of bringing an EV battery from nearly empty to 80 percent in as little as 20 minutes.

While this pales in comparison to BYD’s new lightning-fast chargers, which can charge the same amount in only five minutes, the 20-minute chargers work just fine.

After all, this is also probably the minimum amount of time it takes to complete a Costco trip.

The idea is simple: shoppers can park, stock up on bulk groceries and household goods, and return to a vehicle that’s ready for the road.

The timing couldn’t be better.

EV adoption in the US is currently outpacing the build-out of reliable charging infrastructure.

Over 1 million new EVs were registered in 2024, and July 2025 was almost the biggest ever month for US EV sales on record.

Yet drivers often complain about crowded charging stations, long wait times, or chargers that simply don’t work.

And while Tesla’s Supercharger network is growing quickly, it’s still not enough to keep up with the sheer number of EVs out there.

By leveraging its 531 US warehouse locations, Costco could help close the gap with thousands of fast charging stalls, without the need for government funding or incentives.

Costco may or may not expand this partnership

At the end of the day, reliable fast EV charging is the holy grail for owners of electric cars.

Level 3 chargers like the ones installed in North Port deliver a meaningful charge in under an hour, compared to six to eight hours at a Level 2 stall.

And with Tesla opening its Supercharger network to other automakers, demand for fast, hassle-free charging is only climbing.

Costco’s partnership with Electric Era offers an alternative that fits seamlessly into everyday life.

There are still questions, of course.

Will Costco expand this beyond a single store? Will the stalls be able to handle peak weekend shopping rushes?

If the answers are yes, a Costco membership could soon come with an unexpected perk: charging your car while you shop.",https://supercarblondie.com/wp-content/uploads/Electric-Era-at-Costco.webp,N,,2025-08-24 12:08:37.290985

The notice came just as school districts prepare to start their new year, some of them with buses that “cost roughly $345,000 each [and] are now so buggy they are sitting idle,” Politico reports.

“They ran properly for approximately two weeks, then we started getting error messages,” Andrew Dolloff, the superintendent of schools in Yarmouth, Maine, said of the two Lion e-buses his district bought with a federal government grant. The U.S. currently has an estimated 480,000 to 547,000 school buses in operation.

“It’s certainly important,” said Sue Gander, who runs the electric school bus initiative at the Washington, DC-based World Resources Institute. “You want a warranty on your blender, for god’s sake.”

Montreal real estate giant Groupe MACH, a lead investor in the new ownership group, did not respond to a request from The Energy Mix to comment on the Politico post or explain its apparent decision to rescind the warranties. We’ll update this story when we hear back from them.

One of the biggest e-bus grants from the Biden-era Environmental Protection Agency sent $9.9 million to Herscher Community Unit School District #2 in Illinois, enabling the district to buy 25 Lion buses—half of its fleet—and a $450,000 bus barn equipped with charging stations. Now, the district is “really struggling” with one or two of the buses, Superintendent Richard Decman told Politico, and of course “your vocal minority has politicized all this, and thinks [the buses are] the dumbest thing that’s ever been brought on planet Earth.”

But apart from the warranty issue, the buses operate well in winter weather, save the district $7,500 per vehicle per year on diesel fuel—and they also protect child health, reduce air and noise pollution, and serve local electrical grids with their “batteries on wheels”.

Over time, Decman said Herscher wants to keep on building its electric fleet. “The kids love ‘em,” he told Politico. “It’s a much more pleasant ride. It’s quiet, they can hear each other talk.”

More widely, many of the Lion buses are still “working fine. So are vehicles from other bus makers that are financially sound, such as Georgia-based Blue Bird Corporation, which recently reported record profits,” the U.S.-based publication writes. “But school districts with Lion buses now have no recourse for repairs, just as they start ferrying children for the new school year.” Some of them are turning to former Lion employees who are helping them out at no cost, Politico says.

In mid-May, St. Jérôme, Quebec-based Lion looked like it had turned the corner when it announced a “definitive agreement” with a group of Quebec investors for its electric bus manufacturing operation. The new consortium includes serial entrepreneur and former Lion board member Pierre Wilkie and Groupe MACH founder and president Vincent Chiara.

Earlier in May, Lion looked like it was on its way to liquidation when the Quebec government refused any further public funds after investing tens of millions of dollars in the company. But then, the Wilkie/Groupe MACH consortium “agreed to provide new capital, bolstered by the renewal of a provincial government subsidy program that offers incentives to buyers of electric buses,” the Globe and Mail wrote at the time. The new owners said they would take the company private, with a more modest business plan likely focusing on electric school bus manufacturing in St. Jérôme.

“Retail shareholders will probably be wiped out,” the Globe stated, “while other investors could also lose the bulk of their holdings.”

It is more than just an environmental setback — it is a direct assault on states’ ability to hold polluters accountable.

At a time when rising seas, raging wildfires and record-breaking heat make the climate crisis impossible to ignore — last year alone was the hottest on record — the president’s move aims to cut off one of the few legal avenues left for demanding corporate responsibility in contributing to the climate crisis.

However, in an ironic twist, a new front in the climate fight may emerge — not from environmental champions, but from many of the Republican attorneys general who have long ignored the reality of climate change.

Across several states, Republican attorneys general led by Texas’s Ken Paxton (R), have launched a lawsuit against major asset managers such as BlackRock, State Street and Vanguard, alleging antitrust violations tied to their environmental, social and governance or ESG investment practices. As far-fetched as it may sound, these lawsuits accuse the financial giants of investing in coal companies as part of a conspiracy to restrict coal production, which would lead to higher prices and make coal less attractive to end consumers.

Their goal is clear: to intimidate asset managers and others in finance out of climate-conscious investing.

Yet these lawsuits may have an unintended consequence, opening a legal window into the inner workings of the coal industry.

At the heart of their legal argument is that asset managers colluded with coal companies to restrict coal production, meaning the coal firms themselves are likely to be directly pulled into the case through the discovery process. And discovery will finally put sunlight on the coal companies’ own internal communications, dark-money funding efforts and strategy memos, among other materials. The findings will provide a solid road map outlining the coal companies’ decades-long efforts to obstruct the energy transition, fund climate disinformation and pressure regulators to maintain the status quo.

Although we have had some snapshots into their tactics, environmentalists have long suspected that the true depth of fossil fuel industry interference in addressing climate change goes far deeper than what has been reported. Now, litigation intended to punish climate-minded investors might help prove it.

If these lawsuits move forward, they will hopefully expose the very tactics that have kept America hooked on outdated and polluting energy sources. Transparency, even when born of political theater, can be a powerful accelerant for public pressure and future legal accountability.

To be clear, this is no reason to cheer on this latest chapter in the Republican Party’s shortsighted crusade against sustainable investing. The attacks on ESG principles are regressive and rooted in political posturing, even if most voters think they are folly. But amid the wreckage of Trump’s climate rollback, there is a glimmer of possibility. Sometimes the most unexpected cracks in the system let the truth shine through.

Trump may be trying to protect polluters from liability through his legally questionable executive orders, but some of his party’s own lawsuits could actually help expose them instead. For climate advocates, it’s a reminder: the fight for our planet will be waged in legislatures, courtrooms and, occasionally, in the very legal battles meant to undermine it.",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/07/coal_wv_ap_0728-e1659043339427.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-08-24 12:08:29.386289

A lot of work ahead on PFAS PFAS pollutes the environment through spills, leaks, industrial processes and the disposal of PFAS-containing products.
The many opportunities for contamination mean that affected community water systems can’t always determine how the chemicals ended up there.","The warnings came in the mail this spring to 47 community water systems serving more than 400,000 Illinois residents: Elevated levels of harmful PFAS, better known as “forever chemicals,” had been found in their drinking water.

The notice, mailed by the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency in April, was triggered by a tighter federal PFAS standard adopted by the state’s pollution control board that month. The state told the water systems to immediately notify their customers by mail, email, post card, text message or telephone.

In some cases, other communities would tap into these water systems in an emergency, so the Illinois EPA sent another notice in May to warn those other systems.

PFAS — perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances — are found in products ranging from clothing to food wrappers and have caused water problems nationwide. Researchers have linked even low levels of chronic PFAS exposure to health effects such as kidney cancer, thyroid disease and ulcerative colitis. Illinois’ revised groundwater quality criteria cover six PFAS chemicals, with notices issued if high levels of any one compound are detected.

“The possible health effects from PFAS depend on numerous factors, including how much a person is exposed, so it is important to minimize PFAS exposure,” the state EPA said in its letter. It noted that residents who wanted to take action could treat their own water with carbon filters or reverse osmosis — but it also warned that in-home treatments “may not always reduce PFAS below levels of concern.”

The community water system in Crest Hill, 30 miles southwest of Chicago, was among those receiving the Illinois EPA letters. The agency said two PFAS chemicals — perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorohexanesulfonic acid (PFHxS) — were found in excessive quantities in two of the city’s wells. PFOA was detected at 13.7 parts per trillion, over three times its regulated limit of 4 ppt. Meanwhile, PFHxS was found at 12.2 ppt, exceeding its 10 ppt limit.

Crest Hill informed residents about the PFAS issue by mail in April, noting that six of the city’s eight wells were uncontaminated. City engineer Ron Wiedeman said state law mandates municipalities exceeding PFAS limits to continue water analysis until 2027, with full results sent to all customers at that time. A large-scale PFAS reduction plan must then be implemented by April 2029.

Wiedeman also acknowledges residents’ confusion regarding when officials became aware of the contamination. Despite analyzing Crest Hill’s wells in 2021 and 2023, the Illinois EPA did not inform cities of the potential dangers until this April, after the state adopted the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s standard set last year.

“There were no maximum restrictions on PFAS, so we didn’t know if we were above or below regulatory limits,” Wiedeman said. “When [Illinois EPA] officially adopted those regulations, then we knew we were over the limits.”

Other Chicago-area community water systems receiving letters from the Illinois EPA include Channahon, Fox Lake, South Elgin and the Criswell Court mobile home park in Joliet, according to the agency.

A lot of work ahead on PFAS

PFAS pollutes the environment through spills, leaks, industrial processes and the disposal of PFAS-containing products. The many opportunities for contamination mean that affected community water systems can’t always determine how the chemicals ended up there.

For instance, a PFAS chemical found in firefighting foams called fluorotelomer sulfonate had been used in Crest Hill, but no direct link exists between its usage and the detected contamination, Wiedeman noted.

“Unfortunately, there is nothing that we can directly point at,” Wiedeman said. “We know of some incidents in the city where fire foam was used, but the locations don’t match to where we have the highest readings of PFAS.”

He added: “PFAS is everywhere, but a lot of people don’t know it.”

As part of the new groundwater quality regulations, the Illinois EPA is collecting PFAS data from every water system in the state. The agency provided guidance to local officials through seven PFAS health advisories issued between 2021 and 2024, EPA public information officer Kim Biggs said in an email.

“We will continue our work with community water systems to ensure residents receive information on these important issues, as well as working with systems to determine any necessary actions to reduce exposure to PFAS,” Biggs said.

Crest Hill’s long-term strategy for mitigating PFAS risk involves transitioning to highly treated Lake Michigan water. Wiedeman said the pipeline infrastructure to make that possible likely will be completed in 2030, when the city’s water will be purified by Chicago’s state-of-the art treatment plants.

“That will handle PFAS or any future contaminants that get into the water,” Wiedeman said.

Processes to mitigate PFAS include reverse osmosis, which harnesses high-pressure membranes to filter out toxins. Meanwhile, researchers at the University of Illinois Chicago are investigating ways to not just remove but utterly eliminate these chemicals.

Led by chemical engineering professor Brian Chaplin, the UIC system employs reactive electrochemical membrane filtration, using adsorbents and catalysts on the membrane to trap and destroy PFAS as tainted water passes through.

The $1 million project, funded by the U.S. Department of Energy’s National Alliance for Water Innovation, is in the prototype phase. Researchers will then test the system in California’s Orange County water district.

“Our goal is to avoid the need for further treatment and destroy PFAS right on site,” Chaplin said. “When we complete this work, this new technology will be ready to be piloted in the industrial and municipal wastewater sectors.”

The system could operate on a smaller scale as well, similar to a water-pitcher filter or water softener. Illinois residents concerned about PFAS can also dump their non-stick cooking pans and similar polluting products, Chaplin added.

“Use cast iron and stainless steel instead,” he said. “Consumers have more power than they realize. If enough people don’t buy these products, the market will have to adjust.”",https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e55c687/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2100x1199+0+151/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fcf%2F81%2F652e64a74cc8ace7a775e3bd3c8d%2Fwater-faucet-color.jpg,N,,2025-08-24 12:07:48.309253

On the question ""Do you agree that the Third Nuclear Power Plant should continue operating once the competent authority has confirmed that there are no safety concerns?"" 74 percent were in favor while 26 percent were against, according to the Central Election Commission.

However, the number of affirmative votes fell short of the 25 percent of eligible voters required for the referendum to pass.

""The failure to reach the threshold shows controversy remains,"" said Chen Jong-shun (陳中舜), an associate researcher at the Center for Green Economy of the Chung-Hua Institution for Economic Research.

Chen suggested that based on previous project experience Taiwan Power Co. (Taipower) could in theory and with broad social consensus restart operations at the plant in ""as little as two years."" However, as there is currently no such consensus ""the future is still unclear.""

Meanwhile, Chen Shih-hau (陳詩豪), director-general of the Research Division V of the Taiwan Institute of Economic Research, said energy security must also consider public opinion, otherwise it ""only increases variables"" in Taipower's planning.

Citing the Lungmen Nuclear Power Plant in New Taipei as an example, he noted that the long-delayed project, which never entered commercial operation, created supply pressures in northern Taiwan until a gas-fired generator at the Datan Power Plant in Taoyuan came online.

Those delays, he said, forced the continued operation of heavy oil-fired units at the Hsieh-ho Power Plant in Keelung, delaying the plant's planned conversion from oil to natural gas.

Chen Shih-hau acknowledged that restarting existing plants is less costly than building new ones, but shutting down large nuclear facilities has ""a significant impact,"" which is ""why energy planning emphasizes diversification.""

""The most feasible form of distributed energy in the future is solar power with electric vehicle storage, followed by natural gas storage with gas-fired units and geothermal,"" said Tsuang Ben-jei (莊秉潔), professor in the Department of Environmental Engineering at National Chung Hsing University.

That amount of power exceeds the province's average hourly demand, and accounts for nearly 45 per cent of all projects proposed since October 2023.
Noel, of the Pembina Institute, said those rules were slow to roll out and ended up introducing new costs and delays.
Smith previously said that, in 2023, Alberta accounted for 92 per cent of all of Canada's new renewable projects.
Reid-Carlson said the energy market restructuring is making it difficult for energy suppliers to get projects going.","Nearly half of proposed renewable energy projects in Alberta are failing to get off the ground, according to a new report from the Pembina Institute, a Canadian clean-energy think tank.

The report's findings, which were released Thursday, come after the provincial government placed a seven-month moratorium on new starts for all wind, solar and geothermal energy projects.

Since the freeze lifted last February, proposed projects — that are estimated to produce 11 gigawatts combined — have been cancelled, the report says. That amount of power exceeds the province's average hourly demand, and accounts for nearly 45 per cent of all projects proposed since October 2023.

""Wind and solar, especially, will typically bring the price of power down when they're operating,"" Will Noel, a Pembina Institute senior electricity analyst, told CBC News.

If projects don't keep pace, power prices could rise, Noel said. The rural communities, where many of these projects were planned, would also miss out on greater tax revenues.

The report found that, while renewables have tapered off, far fewer gas electricity projects were cancelled.

Ed Whittingham, a renewable energy consultant, wasn't surprised. He said the sector was picking up steam, but the moratorium killed all momentum and scared investors.

""This is what happens when you take a booming industry and then you immediately throw a wet blanket on top of it,"" Whittingham said.

When the freeze came, Premier Danielle Smith said the sector had been moving too fast, without enough regulations. The provincial government has since doled out new rules that restrict projects in certain agricultural areas, and locations with pristine views.

Noel, of the Pembina Institute, said those rules were slow to roll out and ended up introducing new costs and delays. He added that it's too soon to know the full effect the regulations will have.

The Alberta government is trying to follow a balanced approach to renewables, and still leads the country in renewable investment, Utilities Minister Nathan Neudorf told CBC in an emailed statement, in response to questions about the report.

Smith previously said that, in 2023, Alberta accounted for 92 per cent of all of Canada's new renewable projects.

""Cancellations in the early stages of the connection process are expected and occur for many reasons,"" Neudorf said in the statement, noting supply and demand in the market as a potential factor.

Other industry watchers are saying that the freeze might have come at a time when the bubble on renewables was already close to popping.

Duane Reid-Carlson, an independent energy consultant, said the entire energy market is seeing a decline in new projects, even if renewable projects were the most affected.

""We've overbuilt; renewables were a major part of that,"" Reid-Carlson said.

Many approved projects stalled during the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to a build-up on the docket, he added.

Reid-Carlson said the energy market restructuring is making it difficult for energy suppliers to get projects going.

Keeping data centers cool Data centers store information and perform complex calculations for businesses, whose increasing automation is steadily ramping up such needs.
After hauling up the pod two years later, Microsoft found that underwater data centers ""are reliable, practical and use energy sustainably.""
Environmental concerns In spite of the apparent benefits of underwater data centers, some concerns remain — especially over potential environmental impacts.
But other researchers say submerged data centers could harm aquatic biodiversity during a marine heat wave — a period of unusually high ocean temperatures.","To grow its economy, China is betting big on artificial intelligence, cloud computing and other digital technology — and a big part of that bet involves rapidly building data centers to boost computing power. But these massive collections of servers gobble up growing amounts of energy, and each one cycles through hundreds of thousands of gallons of water a day to carry away the heat they generate.

That means these facilities — in China and beyond — will increasingly compete with water demand linked directly to human survival, from agriculture to daily drinking. Many companies have sited their data centers in some of the driest regions of the world, including Arizona, parts of Spain, and the Middle East, because dry air reduces the risks of damage to the equipment from humidity, according to an investigation by the nonprofit journalist organization SourceMaterial and the Guardian. Partly to address water concerns, China is now putting a data center in the wettest place there is: the ocean. This June construction began on a wind-powered underwater data center about six miles off the coast of Shanghai, one of China's AI hubs.

""China's ambitious approach signals a bold shift toward low-carbon digital infrastructure, and it could influence global norms in sustainable computing,"" says Shabrina Nadhila, an analyst at energy-focused think tank Ember, who has researched data centers.

Keeping data centers cool

Data centers store information and perform complex calculations for businesses, whose increasing automation is steadily ramping up such needs. These facilities consume vast amounts of electricity and water because their servers work nonstop and in close proximity — and they generate waste heat as a by-product, which can damage equipment and destroy data. So they need to be constantly cooled.

Roughly 40 percent of the electricity consumed by an ordinary data center is for this purpose. Most of that energy is used to chill water, which is sprayed into the air that circulates around the servers or is allowed to evaporate near them, lowering their temperatures. That water can come from underground, from nearby rivers or streams, or from reclaimed wastewater.

Instead undersea data centers use pipes to pump seawater through a radiator on the back of server racks to absorb heat and carry it away. Hailanyun — the company sometimes referred to as HiCloud that is behind the Shanghai data center — says an assessment conducted with the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology shows its project uses at least 30 percent less electricity than on-land data centers, thanks to natural cooling.

Related: AI is entering an 'unprecedented regime.' Should we stop it — and can we — before it destroys us?

The Shanghai center will also be connected to a nearby offshore wind farm that is set to supply 97 percent of its energy, says Hailanyun spokesperson Li Langping.

The project's first phase is designed to contain 198 server racks — enough to hold 396 to 792 AI-capable servers — and is slated to begin operation in September, Li says. It is expected to provide enough computing power to complete the equivalent of training GPT-3.5 — the large language model that OpenAI released in 2022 and used to fine-tune ChatGPT — in the space of a day, he adds. Yet Hailanyun's Shanghai center is small compared with a typical land-based one: a medium-scale data center in China normally has up to 3,000 standard racks, while a superscale version can contain more than 10,000.

Leapfrogging the U.S.

At the core of Hailanyun's $223-million Shanghai gambit is a technology that Microsoft pioneered more than a decade ago under an effort called Project Natick, in which the company sank a shipping-container-sized capsule holding more than 800 servers 117 feet below the surface off the coast of Scotland. After hauling up the pod two years later, Microsoft found that underwater data centers ""are reliable, practical and use energy sustainably.""

The experiment also resulted in fewer broken servers compared with on-land data centers because the vessel was sealed off and filled with nitrogen, which is less corrosive than oxygen, Microsoft said in a 2020 press release. The lack of people also meant that the equipment avoided physical contacts or movements that may otherwise cause them damage in an on-land center, the company said.

But Microsoft has reportedly shelved Project Natick. A company spokesperson did not answer questions about whether or not the project was terminated. Instead, they provided a statement: ""While we don't currently have data centers in the water, we will continue to use Project Natick as a research platform to explore, test, and validate new concepts around data center reliability and sustainability.""

Hailanyun aims to leapfrog American companies: if the Shanghai project is successful, Li expects his company to springboard toward large-scale deployments of offshore, wind-powered undersea data centers with the support of the Chinese government.

Zhang Ning, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of California, Davis, who specializes in next-generation low-carbon infrastructure, notes that Hailanyun has moved from a pilot project conducted in Hainan in December 2022 to commercial rollouts in less than 30 months — ""something Microsoft's Project Natick never attempted.""

Environmental concerns

In spite of the apparent benefits of underwater data centers, some concerns remain — especially over potential environmental impacts. Microsoft researchers found their pod had caused some localized warming in the sea, though the impact was limited. ""The water just meters downstream of a Natick vessel would get a few thousandths of a degree warmer at most,"" they wrote.

But other researchers say submerged data centers could harm aquatic biodiversity during a marine heat wave — a period of unusually high ocean temperatures. In those cases, the outlet water from the vessel would be even warmer and hold less of the oxygen that aquatic creatures need to survive, a 2022 paper said.

Another concern is security. A 2024 study found that undersea data centers can be destroyed by certain noises carried out by underwater speaker systems, which raises concerns about malicious attacks using sound.

In response to such concerns, Hailanyun says its undersea data centers are ""environmentally friendly,"" citing an assessment conducted on one of its test pods in southern China's Pearl River in 2020. ""The heat dissipated by the undersea data center caused less than one degree of temperature rise in the surrounding water,"" Li says. ""It virtually did not cause any substantial impact.""

The undersea data center concept seems to have growing appeal beyond China. Countries including South Korea have also announced plans to pursue them, while Japan and Singapore are mulling data centers that float on the ocean's surface instead.

Zhang says that whether other coastal areas will dive into the trend hinges less on technical feasibility and more on how quickly would-be operators can resolve the regulatory, ecological and supply-chain questions that ""China is now tackling at scale.""",https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ctBjaKPynfZmcdnnEkvrDj.jpg,N,,2025-08-24 12:07:15.207090

“The Great Nicobar mega infrastructure project is without doubt a maha ecological disaster. I have had exchanges with the Union Minister of Environment and Forests on this subject but the march of folly continues,” he wrote.

Ramesh also pointed to fresh evidence suggesting that the local administration misrepresented its compliance with the Forest Rights Act, 2006. According to him, officials falsely claimed that:

1. The rights of the local tribal communities under the Forest Rights Act have been identified and settled.

2. The consent of the affected tribal communities has been lawfully obtained.

“It has been abundantly clear for some time that the project is simply being bulldozed through,” he added.

As both nations navigate the Trump administration's protectionist agenda and domestic economic priorities, investors must assess how these developments reshape opportunities in the auto, steel, and energy sectors. This analysis explores the strategic positioning of key industries and offers actionable insights for capitalizing on the evolving trade landscape.

Auto Sector: Stabilization and EV-Driven Opportunities

The auto industry has emerged as a focal point of Canada-US trade normalization. Canada's decision to drop retaliatory tariffs on USMCA-compliant goods, effective September 1, 2025, aligns with U.S. exemptions for auto imports, signaling a de-escalation of tensions. This move follows the U.S. extension of auto tariff exemptions indefinitely, providing stability for cross-border supply chains.

For investors, the auto sector's resilience hinges on two trends: electric vehicle (EV) adoption and supply chain reconfiguration. Canadian automakers and suppliers, such as Magna International (MGA) and Stellantis (STLA), are well-positioned to benefit from U.S. demand for EV components, particularly as the U.S. seeks to reduce reliance on Asian supply chains. Additionally, the removal of tariffs on USMCA-compliant goods reduces production costs for Canadian manufacturers, enhancing their competitiveness.

Investors should monitor Tesla (TSLA) and other EV leaders for signals of sector momentum, as U.S. policy shifts (e.g., tax credits for domestic EV production) could further accelerate demand. However, risks remain, including potential U.S. tariffs on non-USMCA imports and geopolitical disruptions.

Steel Sector: Protectionism and Strategic Diversification

The steel industry remains a flashpoint in Canada-US trade dynamics. The U.S. doubled Section 232 tariffs on steel and aluminum to 50% in June 2025, excluding USMCA-compliant imports. While this protects U.S. domestic producers like Nucor (NUE) and U.S. Steel (X), it pressures Canadian steelmakers such as ArcelorMittal Dofasco (MT) and Stelco (STL).

Canada's retention of 25% retaliatory tariffs on U.S. steel and aluminum reflects its leverage in negotiations, but long-term sustainability depends on USMCA compliance and diversification. For example, Canadian steel producers with U.S. market access under USMCA may mitigate tariff impacts, while those reliant on non-USMCA exports face headwinds.

Investors should prioritize U.S. steel companies with strong domestic demand and low-cost production, as well as Canadian firms with diversified export markets. However, the sector's volatility—driven by potential further U.S. tariffs or global supply chain shifts—warrants caution.

Energy Sector: Tariff-Driven Reconfiguration and Renewable Shifts

The energy sector faces a dual challenge: U.S. tariffs on critical materials and the transition to renewables. The 50% Section 232 copper tariff, effective August 1, 2025, has raised costs for U.S. energy infrastructure, particularly for transformers and grid components. Similarly, a pending Section 232 investigation into critical minerals could impose tariffs on materials essential for solar, wind, and battery technologies.

Canada's energy exports to the U.S. remain critical, with crude oil and natural gas accounting for 70% of U.S. hydrocarbon imports. However, U.S. tariffs on Canadian energy imports (10% for crude, 25% for Mexican) have forced companies to re-evaluate long-term contracts and explore domestic production. For example, Canadian energy firms like Enbridge (ENB) and Suncor (SU) are pivoting toward U.S. markets with USMCA-compliant exemptions, while U.S. companies are accelerating investments in domestic shale and renewables.

Investors should focus on energy companies with diversified portfolios and exposure to U.S. markets. For renewables, firms involved in critical mineral processing (e.g., lithium, cobalt) and grid infrastructure (e.g., copper recycling) offer long-term upside, despite near-term tariff risks.

Strategic Investment Recommendations

Auto Sector: Target EV supply chain players and U.S.-listed Canadian automakers with USMCA compliance. Monitor EV battery manufacturers and lithium producers for growth potential.

Steel Sector: Prioritize U.S. steel producers with low-cost domestic operations and Canadian firms with diversified export markets. Hedge against further U.S. tariff escalations.

Energy Sector: Invest in energy companies with U.S. market access and renewable energy infrastructure. Diversify exposure to critical minerals and grid technologies.

Conclusion

The Canada-US trade de-escalation in 2025 creates both opportunities and risks for key sectors. While the auto industry benefits from policy alignment, the steel and energy sectors must navigate protectionist pressures and supply chain reconfiguration. Investors who strategically position themselves in resilient, USMCA-compliant industries—and hedge against potential policy shifts—stand to capitalize on the evolving North American trade ecosystem. As the USMCA review looms, staying attuned to regulatory developments and sectoral trends will be critical for long-term success.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-24 15:04:08.666712

10 stocks we like better than Rivian Automotive ›

After two straight quarters of positive gross margins, Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ: RIVN) returned to producing negative gross margins in the second quarter. This largely appears to be due to higher material costs, as China's cutback on the export of heavy rare-earth metals in the quarter disrupted supply chains and drove up the cost of electric vehicle (EV) production.

Meanwhile, a reduction of regulatory tax credits will be a headwind going forward, as the $7,500 U.S. federal EV tax credit will expire at the end of September. As a result, Rivian lowered its expectations for 2025 regulatory credit sales from a prior outlook of $300 million down to $160 million. Tax credits are pure gross margin, so that reduction hurts. Tariffs will also be a headwind, with Rivian estimating that tariffs will cost it a couple of thousand dollars per vehicle.

The automaker said it is now looking for gross profits to be about breakeven for the full year. That is down from its prior outlook of it turning a modest gross profit in 2025. Gross margin and gross profit are key metrics for Rivian, as it must be able to make its vehicles for less than it sells them for to even think about becoming profitable and generating free cash flow down the road.

The R2 is key

Much of the company's focus is on preparing for the launch of its lower-priced R2 SUV next year, which is priced starting at around $45,000. Rivian is looking for the new SUV to have much wider appeal than its current luxury R1 SUVs, which can run over $100,000 for some configurations. The company will shut down its main manufacturing facility for three weeks in September in preparation for the launch. It expects peak deliveries to be in the third quarter of this year.

Despite the R2 coming in at a much cheaper price than the R1, it is expected to have a healthy gross margin. The smaller vehicle will have a much lower underlying cost structure due to lower materials costs and manufacturing efficiencies. Material costs will be around half those of the R1, and Rivian has contractually negotiated prices locked in with suppliers. The R2 will also benefit from higher expected volumes, as well as the shared fixed cost absorption from Rivian's facility that also manufactures the R1 and its electric delivery vans (EDVs).

With the launch of the R2 next year, the company is looking to be EBITDA breakeven in 2027 following a full year of the vehicle being in production. It also expects to benefit from increased momentum in its higher-margin software and services segment.

Turning to its Q2 results, Rivian's revenue rose by 12% to $1.3 billion despite fewer vehicle deliveries. The company produced 5,979 vehicles and delivered 10,661 in the quarter, compared to 9,612 vehicles produced and 13,790 delivered a year ago.

Automobile revenue dropped by 14% to $927 million, while software and service revenue surged from $84 million to $376 million. Management said its production volumes declined significantly due to supply chain complexities and trade policy shifts. Software revenue, meanwhile, was helped by strong contributions from its joint venture with Volkswagen.

The company was able to shrink its loss from $1.5 billion a year earlier to $1.1 billion. It also reduced its free cash outflows to $398 million from $1 billion a year ago.

Looking ahead, the EV maker maintained its deliveries forecast of between 40,000 and 46,000 units. It now expects an adjusted EBITDA loss of between $2 billion to $2.25 billion, versus earlier guidance for a loss of between $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion.

Should investors buy the dip?

Rivian has been facing some headwinds with both tariffs and trade policy supply chain disruptions. The end of the EV federal tax credit this fall will only add to that.

However, the company has made great strides in improving its cost structure, and the R2 is the future of the company. If the R2 can prove a success, the company should be on its way to generating free cash flow and profits in the future. In the meantime, with $7.5 billion in cash and short-term investments, the company has plenty of liquidity to invest and grow its brands moving forward.

Rivian remains a high-risk/high-reward stock, but I think risk-tolerant investors can use the drop in price to add a small position ahead of the R2 launch next year.

The Grain Belt Express project calls for work crews to have access to any part of the 160-acre farm at any time.
It’s also that he’s not convinced that power from the Grain Belt Express would be green, affordable or even necessary.
In a Grain Belt Express statement last month, Hanaway called Bailey’s investigation of the transmission line “unlawful and politically motivated.’’ On Tuesday, she told reporters she’ll recuse herself from Grain Belt Express deliberations when she becomes attorney general early next month.
Walling’s environmental coalition has already endorsed the Grain Belt Express.","For seven years, Michael Polsky has been trying to build a high-voltage power line from the windswept prairies of Kansas to the ravenous electrical grids of the Midwest and East Coast.

He brings plenty of firepower to the task.

His Chicago-based company Invenergy is the country’s largest privately held generator of renewable power. And his investors include Blackstone, the world’s biggest private equity firm. But it’s been a seesaw battle, and the outcome is still in doubt.

One of the main problems for Polsky’s power line is that it needs to cross lots of farmland in Kansas, Missouri and Illinois. And lots of farmers hate the idea of eminent domain, especially when it’s a private developer such as Polsky who wants their land.

The Grain Belt Express has filed nearly 50 eminent domain lawsuits to obtain the right-of-way it needs in Missouri alone, according to Andrew Bailey, the state’s attorney general. Most of these cases have been settled, but emotions still run high. In Illinois, the state Supreme Court is also preparing to weigh in.

On July 2, Bailey opened an investigation into the Grain Belt Express for making false claims. Invenergy was grabbing land, he said in an earlier statement, “to satisfy the greed of private investors.’’

President Donald Trump followed up by canceling a loan guarantee for the transmission line. The president also accelerated the phase out of hefty tax credits for wind and solar farms, including those whose power the line was intended to carry.

Still, experts say that among all the energy developers in the United States, Polsky may be best equipped to navigate today’s treacherous political waters.

He’s got deep-pocketed Wall Street backers and an enormous tailwind in the prospect of soaring electricity prices for the foreseeable future. He can revert faster than most to any of the power plant technologies he’s already mastered, and to some still on the drawing board.

These include natural gas, which he may hook up to his Grain Belt Express after facing a backlash from Republican lawmakers over his ties to wind power, according to Bloomberg News. He may ship power from coal plants too, Bloomberg said.

“Polsky has always been ahead of the curve. He was one of the early entrants in utility-scale renewables and one of the first in utility-scale batteries,” said Mark Pruitt, an energy consultant.

Pruitt is the former head of the Illinois Power Agency. This state agency procures affordable power for low-income residents. “Nobody is always right all the time,” he said. “But Polsky has been right enough to continuously build his company.”

With the Grain Belt Express, Polsky is not just trying to build an 804-mile power line that starts in Kansas and ends just east of the Illinois line in Indiana. He’s planting the flag of private equity in a transmission business that up till now has mostly been the exclusive preserve of regulated utilities.

The power line would carry 5 gigawatts of electricity, or the equivalent of four nuclear reactors.

Polsky declined the Chicago Tribune’s interview requests. In an Inc. magazine profile last month, he presented himself as an engineer above all, a pragmatist more than an environmentalist, and someone planning to stay as governments come and go.

“Policies that make it more difficult,” he told the magazine, “are like facing a headwind for the first few miles of a marathon.”

Polsky will face another test of his political skill in October when the Illinois legislature, tormented by rising electricity rates, could vote on renewable-energy type credits for transmission lines, including the Grain Belt Express.

Farmers fight eminent domain

In Rosamond, Illinois, 35 miles southwest of Decatur, Joe Gleespen has been fighting the Grain Belt Express ever since he first heard of an initial version in 2014.

He’s a plaintiff in a lawsuit that successfully blocked the certificate of public necessity that the Illinois Commerce Commission had issued for the transmission line. Invenergy has appealed to the Illinois Supreme Court to restore the certificate, and a ruling could be a year away, according to Paul Neilan, a Bannockburn attorney representing Gleespen.

An adverse ruling could end Invenergy’s ability to build the transmission line in Illinois.

From the bay window in his gray, three-bedroom farmhouse, Gleespen looks south toward his neighbor’s cornfield, which is about the length of a football field away.

The Grain Belt Express aims to acquire about a third of this space, potentially through eminent domain, and construct transmission towers that could be as tall as 10-story buildings all along the south and west borders of his property.

The Grain Belt Express project calls for work crews to have access to any part of the 160-acre farm at any time. But the price the company is offering is “far below” the going rate for land in Christian County, according to Gleespen. And it’s only for the 16 acres that would make up the transmission right-of-way, not the whole farm.

Gleespen, 71, and his wife Lucy, 66, moved to the farm when they got married in 1980, seven years after his father had purchased it, and they raised their two daughters there. Their soybean plants now have leaves of deep green, a color indicating robust health. The plants stand about 42 inches tall, as if preening for the harvest just weeks away.

Gleespen has spent the last decade fighting not just the Grain Belt Express but also a proposed carbon dioxide pipeline on a separate piece of property he owns nearby. He still wakes up at night, he said, to jot down notes on how to preserve his farms.

It’s not just that Gov. JB Pritzker and the Illinois legislature, in his view, should never have allowed a private company such as Invenergy to wield eminent domain. It’s also that he’s not convinced that power from the Grain Belt Express would be green, affordable or even necessary.

All Illinoisans should be reducing their environmental footprint, Gleespen said, just as he and Lucy did by installing geothermal heating and air conditioning 20 years ago. Small nuclear reactors located near data centers, he said, could reduce the need for interstate transmission.

Gleespen is part of overlapping networks of like-minded farmers in Christian County and across the state. Christian County voted for Trump 3-1 last year and has recently begun requiring high-voltage operators, such as Invenergy, to bear the added expense of burying their future transmission lines.

“It’ll be a long and drawn-out affair for Grain Belt,” Gleespen said. “Even if they beat us in the Supreme Court, they’ll have to drag people into court on every one of those eminent domain cases.”

According to Neilan, the Illinois Supreme Court case will turn on a simple question — how much proof should Invenergy be required to present to state regulators to demonstrate it has the funds to complete a project that, if approved, would allow the company to go to court to seize property from farmers.

“The Illinois Commerce Commission dismissed out of hand the landowners’ concerns about having their property involuntarily taken from them for what amounts to a venture capital project,” Neilan said. “You don’t know whether they can even do this project.”

Brad Klein, a managing attorney at the Environmental Law and Policy Center in Chicago, predicted that the court will side with the ICC. The legislature established the commission in the first place, Klein said, as an independent panel with the necessary skills for making this kind of complex policy decision.

In Illinois and Missouri, opponents claim Invenergy has grossly overstated the potential benefits of the Grain Belt Express by counting how much it could save on a federal carbon tax that never had much chance of being enacted, even before Trump took office.

Experts say companies routinely include a carbon tax in their future cost projections, if only as a proxy for the many ways climate change will affect how they operate. An Invenergy spokeswoman declined to respond to written questions about the carbon tax and other issues.

In his announcement in Missouri last month, Bailey specifically included carbon tax savings as one of what he called the false Invenergy claims that he needs to investigate.

On Monday, Trump named Bailey co-deputy director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. But as Bailey’s replacement, Missouri Gov. Mike Kehoe chose Catherine Hanaway, the lead counsel for the Grain Belt Express and a former Republican speaker of the Missouri House of Representatives, according to a report in the Missouri Independent. In a Grain Belt Express statement last month, Hanaway called Bailey’s investigation of the transmission line “unlawful and politically motivated.’’

On Tuesday, she told reporters she’ll recuse herself from Grain Belt Express deliberations when she becomes attorney general early next month. The shakeup may help Polsky. But even the setback with Bailey’s inquiry came two years after the Missouri Public Service Commission gave its final approval to the Grain Belt Express, and seven years after the state’s Supreme Court declined to block the transmission line.

“If projects can’t count on certainty even after being approved and reviewed upon appeal, America can’t count on ever getting steel in the ground,” Invenergy said in a blog post. “America will lose the test of its will to build.”

The art of making electricity

For Polsky, to generate electricity is literally to live the American Dream.

He fled Soviet-controlled Ukraine in 1976 and arrived in Detroit with $500 in his pocket. A decade later, while a night student at the University of Chicago business school, he started a company that designed power plants. That is what he’d been trained to do in Kiev.

He quickly mastered the art of making electricity using everything from natural gas-driven turbines to wind and solar farms to storage batteries.

Today at age 76, he’s so rich that research institutes bearing his name are fighting cancer, teaching entrepreneurship and documenting how Jews died during the Holocaust.

From a glass skyscraper overlooking the South Branch of the Chicago River, Polsky manages 2,800 employees worldwide. He operates 212 generating and battery storage projects with a total capacity of 34 gigawatts. That’s enough to power 12 million homes.

On top of that, Polsky’s pipeline of future projects was worth $150 billion last year, according to The Wall Street Journal.

To gain a sense of the technical challenges Polsky has overcome, a good starting point is Rock Falls, a village 115 miles west of Chicago.

Polsky bought a half-built natural gas plant out of bankruptcy there in 2004, opened it a decade later and has since expanded its capacity to produce 980 megawatts of electricity, equivalent to that of a typical nuclear reactor.

Then, in 2022, Polsky began building a solar farm nearby to generate electricity for making hydrogen. The renewable energy credits he earned help finance the project.

Since then, he’s used green hydrogen to cool his natural gas turbines in Rock Falls. He plans to produce hydrogen for other markets such as chemicals and liquid fuels, according to an Invenergy statement.

Polsky’s excursion into the world of transmission lines became possible in 2009 when federal regulators first allowed private companies — so-called merchant operators — to build them.

Congress had fueled Polsky’s early career in 1992 by allowing private ownership of power plants.

Transmission lines are tougher because they cross more land with more people, said Rob Gramlich, president of Grid Strategies, a Washington, D.C.-based energy consultancy.

Most transmission lines today are built by federally supervised regional grid operators such as Midwest Independent System Operator and PJM Interconnection. Each of these covers several states. In Illinois, PJM encompasses the northern fifth of the state, including the Chicago area. MISO covers the remainder of the state.

PJM and MISO routinely do forecasts on their long-term transmission needs, and they can order local utilities to help foot the bill.

Regulated utilities don’t face the same complaints from disgruntled farmers that they’re protecting greedy investors more than the public interest. But they’re still government-sanctioned monopolies. They rarely move as fast as private operators such as Polsky, or with the same tolerance for risk.

To keep up with accelerating demand from data centers and advanced manufacturers, the United States should be adding transmission lines four times faster than it is, Gramlich said.

Even today, transmission line developers are hopeful for some assistance from the administration, he said.

Department of Energy Secretary Chris Wright has declared transmission to be a priority. Various administration officials are focused on expanding the grid to enable the U.S. to win the artificial intelligence race with China, Gramlich said.

The Grain Belt Express would be a so-called high-voltage, direct current line, or HVDC. Among other things, this would allow power not just to flow to the east when the wind blows in Kansas, but also back to the west when a winter storm knocks out the state’s electrical grid, something that happened in 2021.

“There’s good nuclear in Illinois, very good wind energy to the west, and solar in different parts of the state and the region,” Gramlich said. “So if you just look at the optimum power system configuration, it calls for a lot of transmission in that region.”

The wind and solar tax credits Trump is phasing out can be worth up to 50% of the capitalized cost of such projects, energy industry officials say.

“Any energy project that thought they had a tax credit or a grant or a loan, I think the developer has to go back and reevaluate their project economics,’’ Gramlich said.

Before Trump even took office, Invenergy and its partners canceled an $11 billion underground transmission line intended to transport wind, solar, and hydro power from upstate New York to the borough of Queens in New York City.

The company is still planning overhead lines in Oklahoma and New Mexico. And it’s ready to break ground on the Grain Belt Express next year, assuming that all the financing and federal permits can be secured, according to its website.

In Missouri and Kansas, Invenergy has acquired 95% of the land it needs mostly through voluntary agreements, the company said in a statement. And it’s still seeking private financing for the Grain Belt Express.

“With the loan guarantee, the federal government was saying, `we’ll act as a backstop. We’ll guarantee that we’ll pay a certain price,’” said Chaz Teplin, head of power-grid analysis at the Rocky Mountain Institute, an environmental research group in Basalt, Colorado.

Invenergy is talking with anyone who’s willing to make the same guarantee to buy power, Teplin said.

“For some companies like hyper-scalers and data center builders, power is a small portion of their costs,’’ he said. “We’ve seen this type of company willing to pay a premium for reliable and clean energy, as their facilities remain profitable.’’

Invenergy and Facebook parent Meta, to cite one example, already have close ties. In June, Invenergy agreed to supply an additional 791 megawatts of solar and wind energy for Meta’s data centers in Ohio, Arkansas and Texas. And both companies have a growing interest in nuclear power.

Meta is considering whether to help Constellation Energy expand its nuclear power station in Clinton, Illinois, according to a Chicago Tribune report in June. And Polsky recently told Inc. magazine he can already build everything for a nuclear plant except the reactor itself and may try to compete in this area.

The glass may be half full for Polsky in other ways, said Chris Seiple, vice chairman of Wood Mackenzie, a Boston-based research and data company.

“The renewables industry is very lucky that two things are happening as they are losing these tax credits,” Seiple said.

“The first is all the demand growth from artificial intelligence. And the second is that the cost of building a gas-fired, combined-cycle power plant has nearly doubled in the past three or four years,” he said.

“That means the cost of what renewables are competing with has become so much higher that they are largely competitive to meet the new demand growth without having to get the tax credit,” Seiple said.

Solar, wind and battery storage in the United States are now so affordable they accounted for 93% of all new capacity added to the country’s electricity grids last year, according to CleanView, a Miami-based research group.

A looming shortfall

Illinois remains a net energy exporter thanks to its 11 nuclear reactors, the most of any state.

However, a shortfall is looming as data center demand skyrockets and the state begins closing 28 gigawatts of coal- and natural-gas-generating plants by 2045 to improve air quality. The Trump administration may try to delay these closings. But in a recent study, the Illinois Power Agency projected steep increases in monthly bills over the next quarter-century to reserve future generating capacity for regional power grids.

The 5 gigawatts of power that Polsky wants to pump through his Grain Belt Express won’t solve the Illinois shortfall, as half of the power is being dropped off in Missouri, according to media reports in that state, and the rest will be shared among three regional grids and an electricity co-op that serve dozens of states.

Still, the comprehensive energy bill that the legislature is scheduled to take up in October could pave the way for renewable energy-type credits for the Grain Belt Express and Soo Green line, said Jen Walling, executive director of the Illinois Environmental Council. Soo Green is a transmission line that would run underground alongside a railroad track from Mason City, Iowa, to Yorkville, Illinois.

The comprehensive energy bill would also upgrade the state’s battery storage and energy efficiency programs.

“Labor hasn’t actively supported the bill yet, so one thing that could be helpful would be something labor is excited about, and some of that could be building more transmission,” Walling said.

Marc Poulos, a labor quarterback in Springfield, described the Grain Belt Express and Soo Green lines as “great projects.”

Poulos is the executive director of labor-management operations for International Union of Operating Engineers Local 150.

Walling’s environmental coalition has already endorsed the Grain Belt Express. But she said she won’t know if the coalition can support future transmission line credits until it learns more from state regulators about how much the program will cost.

Legislators are especially sensitive about costs after double-digit rate increases in June at ComEd and Ameren, and with pending votes on, among other things, the Chicago transit system’s budget shortfall.

“We want more transmission, but we need to spend our dollars wisely,” Walling said.

So, besides finding private financing for the Grain Belt Express in the next few months, Polsky will have to convince worried legislators in his home state that the project can deliver affordable electricity even in the face of Trump’s relentless attacks.

Polsky has been preparing for this test for a long time.

According to Inc. magazine, he chose to specialize in renewable energy and storage not just because they’re carbon-free, but also because — unlike fossil fuels — they’re at the dawn of vast efficiencies that come with mass production.

And Polsky has $2.5 billion in the bank, according to Forbes magazine. He can afford to be patient.

“An energy project takes years to develop and build, and operates for decades,” he told Inc. magazine. “So we take that long view.

“At the end of the day, technology listens to the market, not politicians.”

The Maryland Commission on Climate Change, Mitigation Working Group (MWG) has released its 2025 draft policy recommendations intended to make progress toward Maryland’s aggressive climate mitigation goals.

Emissions from cars, trucks, and other modes of transportation are the second largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in Maryland. Sluggish electric vehicle sales, withdrawal of federal subsidies for electric vehicle charging equipment and deauthorization of state authority to impose vehicle emissions mandates are major headwinds slowing progress toward Maryland’s transportation sector goals.

MWG is considering several related proposals, including requiring installation of electric vehicle charging equipment in new multifamily construction, reallocating funds from the Strategic Energy Investment Fund to provide additional rebates for Electric Vehicle purchases, and adopting a clean fuel standard to reduce emissions from heavy trucks and other vehicles.

Electric power generation remains the largest source of emissions. Environmental advocates are again pressing for an economy-wide tax on greenhouse gas emissions as well as emissions standards for fossil fuel power plants.

SAN FRANCISCO, CA, UNITED STATES, August 24, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- Energy America (EA), a USA-based solar module manufacturer and EPC contractor, together with Centauri, its advanced R&D arm, today announced their official entry into the Saudi Arabian renewable energy market. The companies have been granted an investment license from the Kingdom’s Ministry of Investment (MISA), enabling them to operate as a local entity and partner directly with Saudi stakeholders under the framework of Vision 2030.

This milestone unlocks Energy America’s ability to develop utility-scale solar photovoltaic (PV) power plants with integrated Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS), modernize Transmission & Distribution (T&D) networks, and explore the establishment of local solar module manufacturing facilities. These initiatives will strengthen Saudi Arabia’s renewable capacity while building local supply chains, creating jobs, and ensuring technology transfer to Saudi citizens.

U.S. Technology and Financing: A Strategic Advantage for Saudi Arabia

Energy America’s market entry reflects the growing demand for transparent, compliant, and secure renewable energy supply chains. Recent developments in U.S. policy — including the Trump Administration’s Section 232 investigation on polysilicon and FEOC (Foreign Entity of Concern) restrictions — are reshaping global solar supply, reinforcing the importance of American technology in international partnerships.

For Saudi Arabia, this means access to:

EXIM Bank financing support for large-scale solar and storage projects, providing long-term bankability and sovereign-level risk mitigation.

U.S. regulatory alignment, ensuring solar assets deployed in the Kingdom are free from trade-disruption risks and fully compliant with future global regulatory frameworks.

American-engineered solar modules, designed for reliability in extreme climates and developed with the highest standards of traceability, performance, and durability.

“Saudi Arabia’s bold renewable energy targets and pro-business environment under Vision 2030 make it an ideal place for our growth,” said Jack Stone, Chief Executive Officer of Energy America. “By bringing American technology, FEOC-compliant supply chains, and EXIM-backed financing into the Kingdom, we are ensuring that Saudi projects will not only succeed technically but remain secure from shifting trade and regulatory risks. This is the foundation for a durable U.S.–Saudi partnership in clean energy.”

Saudi Market Entry and Local Partnerships

With the Riyadh investment license secured, Energy America and Centauri will establish a regional headquarters in the coming weeks. The companies plan to collaborate closely with Saudi ministries, utilities, private developers, and supply chain partners to deliver:

Utility-scale solar PV and BESS projects supporting grid stability and round-the-clock clean energy.

Transmission & Distribution modernization, aligned with Saudi Arabia’s expanding electricity demand.

Local module manufacturing feasibility studies, designed to maximize domestic content and create a long-term, U.S.-aligned industrial base.

“Saudi Arabia’s strategic role in the Middle East’s energy transition cannot be overstated,” said Kevin Lumbert, Vice President for Saudi Arabia. “By establishing a permanent presence here, we will directly contribute to Vision 2030 — from solar farms and storage systems to advanced T&D infrastructure. More importantly, we are committed to engaging with local suppliers and training Saudi talent so that this transition creates sustainable jobs and knowledge transfer. With American technology and financing behind us, our projects will deliver lasting value for both Saudi Arabia and the wider region.”

Strengthening Vision 2030 Goals

Energy America’s expansion into Saudi Arabia is structured to:

Support 50% renewable energy generation targets by 2030.

Establish bankable projects financed under EXIM Bank programs, reducing reliance on non-compliant imports.

Create local employment opportunities in engineering, manufacturing, and project execution.

Deliver secure, future-proof energy systems that align with U.S. and Saudi regulatory frameworks.

The move could further constrain the US renewable energy industry and lead to additional tariffs.

Probe Initiated Under Trade Law

According to a Federal Register notice, the Department of Commerce began the investigation on August 13, 2025, under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act. Interestingly, this statute allows the president to curb imports deemed a threat to US national security.

The notice did not provide concrete reasons behind the probe, but the administration has requested public input on issues such as reliance on foreign supply chains, the role of government subsidies, potential predatory trade practices, and whether foreign-built turbines could be exploited for security vulnerabilities.

Officials from the Bureau of Industry and Security have so far refrained from commenting on the reasoning or scope of the review.

Part of Broader Offensive Against Wind Energy

The decision comes just days after the administration raised tariffs on steel and aluminium for hundreds of products, including wind turbines, with new duties of up to 50 percent.

President Donald Trump has been vocal and loud in his opposition to renewable energy expansion, walking the talk over the past few weeks.

On Truth Social this week, he criticised wind and solar projects as “destroying farmland” and vowed to halt any federal approvals for them. Since taking office, Trump has already paused permitting of all wind projects on federal lands and waters and indefinitely halted new offshore wind lease sales.

Heavy US Dependence on Foreign Imports

The investigation could have significant implications for the domestic clean-energy sector, as the sector is highly dependent on influence.

According to research firm Wood Mackenzie, the US wind industry relies heavily on imports for blades, drivetrains, and electrical systems. In 2023, wind-related equipment imports totalled USD 1.7 billion, with 41 percent sourced from Mexico, Canada, and China.

Iowans’ anger about water pollution is not abating

Tariffs are unfair, and our representatives should say so

Iowans who vacation in Las Vegas can see magician shows that feature distraction and sleight of hand. Here in Iowa distraction, and sleight of hand was practiced in an Aug. 17 Register guest essay by state Rep. Ryan Weldon and in comments by U.S. Rep. Zach Nunn. Their ploy is to distract from the damage done by President Donald Trump’s tariffs. This damage is lower farm income and higher prices of Chinese goods to Iowans.

They distract by using the term “fair trade.” It implies Weldon and Nunn are experts in “fair” trade. What is “fair” trade? Before Trump tinkered with tariffs, we in the U.S. bought cheap goods from China. Chinese citizens subsidized the production of these cheap goods and put up with environmental damage. This made Chinese goods cheaper to us in Iowa.

Plenty of Chinese people, including my former Chinese students, must be angry about this subsidized production and environmental damage in China. But the Chinese, before Trump’s tariffs, enjoyed low prices on grain shipped from Iowa. These prices were low because our government subsidizes agriculture. Our prices are low also because farm environmental damage, especially water pollution, is pushed downstream to urban areas and onto future generations.

Before Trump’s tariffs, the governments of China and the U.S. argued but arrived at tariffs and balance of payments including exchange rates. Were these agreements “fair”? Each country had a different view on that. But, one thing is certain. Both countries prospered. Iowa prospered.

What seems clearly unfair are the tariff-driven higher prices paid by Iowans for Chinese goods and by Chinese citizens who buy our grain. Iowa’s politicians should focus on tariff unfairness instead of trying to distract us like the magicians of Las Vegas.

Republicans sign America’s death warrant by bowing to Trump

America's new message we must convey to the world: ""We're so very sorry!""

Not a single second passes where unrelenting human suffering shouldn't evoke America's heartfelt sympathies, accompanied by committed, truthful, responsive action. That, however, appears to no longer be the case in President Donald Trump's America. Truth, humility, and humanity are in short supply in a dictator's world.

Whether we're witnessing Trump's incoherent blaming of Ukraine for war criminal Putin's terrorizing murderous assaults and kidnappings, or Trump's racially based warrantless detentions and deportations, or the deadly devastating consequence of his cuts to USAID, or his endorsement of Gaza starvations, or any of the voluminous other grotesque Trump administration practices and policies, the intentional abandonment of America's principles is the root cause of our decline. For this, and much more, most of the world deserves an apology. Allies have been abandoned, enemies are being embraced.

Ever since taking office his second term, our convicted felon, twice-impeached, sexual predator, habitual liar, gerrymanderer in chief has only reinforced his disregard for the rule of law and the Constitution upon which our Country was founded. There are far too many irrefutable examples of Trump's anti-American conduct to list, but the real crisis, in truth, lies elsewhere.

The real crisis is found in the lack of courage of Republican Party sycophants who are so cowardly and intimidated by Trump's vengeance that they have sold their souls to their would-be king. Their One Big Beautiful Bill stands as a testament to their allegiance to Trump over country; their wholesale confirmations of unqualified, incompetent Cabinet officials demonstrates the same. The office of president of the United States has been co-opted for personal enrichment, vengeance, and ego. The office of president of the United States granted Jan. 6 criminals wholesale pardons. These honorable elected officials continue to sit idly by while presidential lawlessness reaches new heights.

First lady Barbara Bush sat on the Board of the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. One of President George H.W. Bush's speeches is quoted in a Mayo exhibit. Regarding our nation, it reads, in part: ""America is never wholly herself unless she is engaged in high moral principle.""

It is past time for America to tell the citizens of the world that we apologize for all of the harms they are now suffering, we are truly sorry, and we will work diligently to Make America Principled Again.

Stop buying ethanol to stand up for clean water and property rights

Are you upset that the Iowa Legislature refuses to do anything about the pollution of our drinking water? Are you upset that the governor served her big donors rather than the public by vetoing the bill to control eminent domain for carbon pipelines? One thing you can do, in addition to voting out the culprits, is to boycott ethanol. Ethanol is driving both of those problems, and by refusing to use it you can express your displeasure with how corporate agriculture is impacting our lives.

Root causes of water problems goes unexplored

It’s mind-boggling to me that the Register continues to run seemingly a new story every day on Iowa's water quality without ever looking into basic facts, root causes and the main actors.

Where are the numbers on comparable metros or ag states and how are they addressing similar situations? Why are we not directly asking Des Moines Water Works why it didn’t keep up on infrastructure or expand capacity over the past 20 years? Water utilities’ payroll and political power have grown, but the last new treatment facility groundbreaking I'm aware of was in 2006, when I was living in the metro.

The place has exploded with development and growth since then. Where's the accountability, where are the questions for the leadership, what are they doing with all the rate increases? We all know there won't be any answers or responsible adults looking out for us in the Iowa House or the Polk County supervisors' boardroom, we know that much.

So let's just run another story to keep everybody scared and nervous and talking about “water quality” with generic references to agriculture and the laughable lawn watering ban without addressing the underlying causes and the publicly paid actors who could and should be working on it.

Democrats seem unbothered by certain billionaires

In his recent Des Moines Register interview, Democratic senatorial aspirant Josh Turek shoehorned in liberal boilerplate castigation of ""billionaires.""

Of course, when Democrats like Turek inveigh against billionaires, here are ones they never cite: George Soros, Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, Michael Bloomberg, Warren Buffett, Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, Mark Cuban, Jeff Bezos, and Reid Hoffman.

Why not? Because those and others of their ilk bankroll woke progressive Democrat and anti-American causes dear to Democrats' hearts.

I'll believe Turek's and Democrats' rhetoric re: wealth when they rail against those men, by name, instead of cashing their campaign contribution checks.

Public officials seek permission to discriminate

I am weary of people like former Kentucky county clerk Kim Davis who feign religious persecution to defend an absurd belief system, for what? So they can discriminate against others, as Davis did in declining to issue marriage licenses for same-sex couples.

I once listened to a lecture from a Holocaust survivor, and she stated that all people need is permission. The law is the only thing keeping some of us from becoming savages. I worry for my LGBTQ friends, and now President Donald Trump is targeting homeless people. If I know my history, it won't stop there.

If your belief system can't survive without an enemy or a scapegoat, perhaps it's time to choose again.

Housing is inadequate in smaller Iowa communities, too

Rekha Basu’s July 27 column highlights the struggles of working citizens in Des Moines who cannot afford housing despite full-time employment. Decorah, a small but well-developed Iowan town, faces similar challenges.

According to Northeast Iowa Community Action Corp., there are only about three low-income housing complexes in Decorah, while the U.S. Census Bureau reports that 7.7% of the town's 7,454 residents live below the poverty line. This leaves a portion of qualifying residents without a place to live. Young professionals, such as recent graduates from Luther College or those starting at the local hospital, also struggle with rent. Local Realtors state that one-bedroom apartments can cost $800 to $1,000 per month, which eats a significant portion of someone's income.

This situation reflects Basu’s observations in Des Moines, where full-time workers struggle to afford housing. Decorah shows how the affordable housing crisis extends beyond just large cities in Iowa. Small communities also face challenges to keep their residents housed. To address these gaps, the city must support rental assistance programs, expand housing options, and challenge mindsets that limit new development.

Just like Des Moines, Decorah needs more resources to advocate for the community to ensure there is a sustainable future in housing.

Why don’t clean energy tax credits lower my bill?

The July 22 story “Will Big Beautiful Bill raise your energy bill?” repeats an estimate from the Energy Innovation Policy and Technology that ”Iowans will pay $350 more for energy in 2025 because of the Big Beautiful Bill.”

This increase is due to the repeal of certain energy tax credits, along with domestic sourcing requirements again according to the Energy Innovation Policy and Technology. The story also refers to a comment by MidAmerican Energy that the credits are critical for keeping costs down.

The story then states that Energy Innovation Policy and Technology group says phasing out clean energy tax credits will hamper electricity generated in the United States. (I assume they mean clean energy.) Later the piece says that an analysis (no source is reported) “expects Iowa to lose wind and solar capacity by 2035. That could force utilities to rely more on natural gas, at higher prices, which they are expected to pass on to consumers.”

First, when hasn’t an increase, or decrease, in natural gas prices been passed on to consumers? Second, MidAmerican Energy, for one, has received $10 billion in credits to build the clean energy projects it currently has. Just because the money/credit comes from the state and federal government doesn’t mean it is free.

Those $10 billion in creits amounts to about $3,200 for each user in the MidAmerican system. Yet my energy bill goes up, not down. Where’s my share of this credit? Are we paying for this infrastructure twice? Once in the governmental subsidies and secondly in our bills for infrastructure? Third, wind and solar energy are not currently reliable on a 24-hour basis so we have to pay for a dual system so we can have energy at night. “Clean energy” needs a backup. The natural gas plants are and will remain that backup. Therefore, the price of the backup is already included in the “clean energy” package.

Iowa seems intent on avoiding spending on food assistance

Thank you for the Aug. 10 editorial exposing the flaws of Gov. Kim Reynolds’ Healthy Kids Iowa program. As the piece makes clear, Healthy Kids Iowa is a poor replacement for Summer EBT because it serves fewer than 10% of the families previously helped, the monthly pickup system is inconvenient for providers, difficult or impossible for families without transportation, and it limits participation by Iowa farmers. The entire programs seems designed not to work, but to avoid spending money on food-insecure Iowans.

When I visited the governor’s office with advocacy groups last month, I mentioned a refugee family that lives 4.5 miles from the distribution site with no transportation. I was told about “Healthy Kids Direct,” a little-known program that mails shelf-stable food — not the fresh items provided at pickup sites. It’s not listed on Iowa’s Department of Health and Human Services website, doesn’t meet federal guidelines, and is funded not by the feds, but entirely by the state. DHHS staff told me it’s very small and unlikely to expand — perhaps by design.

Pair this with added work requirements, and the result is fewer families receiving help and more children going hungry. That’s the opposite of “Healthy Kids.”

Thomas Rendon, Des Moines

Cut air and vehicle travel if we’re serious about climate change

An Aug. 10 guest essay addressed climate change and its threat to the future generations of America.

The author does not offer any suggestions of how to reduce carbon emissions, so I will offer two suggestions.

Do you remember when due to COVID-19 there was limited airline travel? Do you remember that when there was no airline travel the CO2 levels in the atmosphere dropped by 30%? Since most airline travel is a discretionary life choice, why not raise the cost of airline travel to the levels of the 1950s and 1960s, so that we can eliminate this needless insult to our fresh air.

They say that it is every American's dream to own a home. I say that every American dreams of owning a car. Therefore it only makes sense that all immigration should be reduced or eliminated in an effort to hold stable or even reduce the number of energy-guzzling vehicles on the road.

So if we are really serious about our future generations, then we have to also get serious about our national debt crisis. So why don't we forget politics and work together to insure a bright future for the upcoming generations of Americans.

Donald C Parsons, Sioux City

Iowans’ anger about water pollution is not abating

The Environmental Protection Agency’s decision to remove seven stream segments from the Iowa impaired waters list is a leap backward for public health and environmental quality. These segments, including parts of the Des Moines, Raccoon, Cedar, Iowa and South Skunk rivers, are known to have nitrate levels well above the drinking water threshold of 10 mg/L.

When nitrate flows unchecked into surface water, an undue and expensive burden is placed on water utilities or homeowners to ensure drinking water is safe.

In a time when Iowans are more concerned than ever about water issues, EPA’s tone-deaf decision rings hollow. This summer, Central Iowa Water Works imposed a first-ever lawn watering ban because of high nitrate levels. Almost 900 Iowans showed up to learn from the scientists behind the Central Iowa Source Water Research Assessment. Over 700 Iowans requested Nitrate Watch monitoring kits just this summer. Iowans are paying attention. Our waterways need more protection, not less.

Removing waterways from the impaired list doesn’t make water quality issues disappear – it only hides them. Iowans must stay vigilant and continue to hold leaders and polluters accountable. Based on the concern we’ve seen this summer, it’s clear that Iowans will continue demanding clean water.

Ending clean vehicle tax credits will cause some taxpayers to lose federal tax credits.

Clean Energy Vehicle Credits End September 30, 2025

If you have been planning to buy a clean vehicle, you need to act soon if you wish to qualify for federal tax credits. Tax credits for both individuals and businesses are ending more than seven years earlier than they were originally scheduled to end due to One Big Beautiful Bill being signed into law. These tax credits now end September 30, 2025!

What Is a Clean Vehicle?

Per the IRS, a clean vehicle is one that gets plugged in (also known as an electric vehicle) or a fuel cell electric vehicle.

How to Qualify for the Tax Credit

Currently, if you buy a new clean vehicle for personal use, it can qualify you for the Clean Vehicle Credit. If you purchase a new vehicle, the credit is up to $7,500. Certain used electric vehicles can earn you a credit of up to $4,000. Tax credits are a dollar-for-dollar reduction in your tax bill, so these are substantial savings!

To qualify for the credit, the vehicle must meet several guidelines. To see if your vehicle qualifies, you can go to fueleconomy.gov. Further, the following income thresholds must be met:

Income Limits and Maximum Price for New Vehicles

Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI) in the year of delivery (or the year before delivery) is no more than:

$150,000 if single,

$225,000 if head of household,

$300,000 if married filing jointly

Vehicle cost no more than

$55,000 if a sedan,

$80,000 if an SUV, pickup, or van

Income Limits and Maximum Price for Used Vehicles:

MAGI is no more than:

$75,000 if single,

$112,500 if head of household,

$150,000 if married filing jointly

Vehicle cost no more than $25,000

Commercial Electric Vehicle Credit

In the case of businesses and tax-exempt organizations, the Commercial Electric Vehicle Credit allows a credit up to $7,500 for vehicles under 14,000 pounds, and up to $40,000 for vehicles weighing 14,000 pounds or more. There are no income limits or price caps for businesses to qualify, but there are several eligibility requirements that must be met. You can go to fueleconomy.gov to see if your vehicle qualifies.

Point-of-Sale Rebates

Instead of waiting to claim the tax credit when filing your taxes, you could have taken it at the time of purchase. This would have reduced the price you paid for the vehicle. You cannot have both a tax credit and a point-of-sale rebate for the same vehicle.

Takeaway

These federal tax credits end September 30, 2025, so you must purchase and take delivery of your vehicle by then.

Algiers, Algeria | Algeria has set forth a clear roadmap to anchor its ambition of becoming a regional leader in electric battery manufacturing, identifying three strategic industrial milestones deemed essential for the success of its Lithium–Iron–Phosphate (LFP) battery project.

The announcement followed a high-level meeting on Thursday between Belkacem Soultani, CEO of Sonaram, and Dr. Karim Zaghib, the renowned Algerian scientist whose expertise in energy storage technologies has gained international recognition.

Three Industrial Foundations

At the heart of the plan are three key operations:

Phosphate conversion units to produce phosphoric acid, a cornerstone of the LFP battery value chain.

Lithium ore processing and refining units to secure a reliable supply of raw material in line with global standards.

Iron ore purification from Gara Djebilet, specifically lowering phosphorus content to produce high-grade iron compatible with advanced industrial applications.

According to Sonaram’s statement, these pillars constitute the backbone of Algeria’s strategy to establish a self-sufficient and competitive battery ecosystem.

Scientific Diplomacy and International Cooperation

The project’s scientific dimension is being reinforced through joint research programs between Algerian universities, Université du Québec, and MERC at Laurentian University in Canada. The focus will be on developing innovative solutions to address high phosphorus levels in Gara Djebilet’s iron ore, a technical bottleneck whose resolution could unlock immense potential for Algeria’s metallurgical and battery industries.

Professor Zaghib, who has been working for six months with a multinational research team on iron purification techniques, stressed that “preliminary results are promising and open wide industrial horizons for Algeria.”

State-Level Support and Strategic Vision

The initiative follows the Memorandum of Understanding signed in April 2025 between Sonaram’s ORGM subsidiary and Prof. Zaghib. It has since gained momentum, with both sides agreeing to hold upcoming sessions with the Ministry of Energy, Mines, and Renewable Energies to accelerate regulatory frameworks and institutional mechanisms.

The government’s commitment is evident. President Abdelmadjid Tebboune and Energy Minister Mohamed Arkab have personally received Dr. Zaghib, underlining Algeria’s determination to support his vision and translate it into industrial reality.

Toward Energy Sovereignty and Green Transition

Sonaram emphasized that these measures reflect Algeria’s strategic will to fast-track the project, strengthen its position in global renewable energy markets, safeguard energy sovereignty, and pivot toward a knowledge-based green economy.

Dr. Zaghib has repeatedly affirmed that Algeria possesses the resources and know-how to build a homegrown electric vehicle industry while developing a broader industrial base anchored in rare minerals and clean energy technologies.

Trump's statement this week seemed to confirm industry fears that the Interior Department will block federal permits for solar and wind projects.
Engie's North American subsidiary, headquartered in Houston, will operate about 11 gigawatts of solar, battery storage and wind power by year end.
The price that Avantus charges for solar power has roughly doubled to $60 per megawatt-hour as interest rates and tariffs have increased over the years, said CEO Graham.
Artificial intelligence power crunch Fewer renewable power plants could increase the risk of brownouts or blackouts, Smith said.","President Donald Trump's attack on solar and wind projects threatens to raise energy prices for consumers and undermine a stretched electric grid that's already straining to meet rapidly growing demand, renewable energy executives warn.

Trump has long said wind power turbines are unattractive and endanger birds, and that solar installations take up too much land. This week, he said his administration will not approve solar and wind projects, the latest salvo in a campaign the president has waged against the renewable energy industry since taking office.

""We will not approve wind or farmer destroying Solar,"" Trump posted on Truth Social Wednesday. ""The days of stupidity are over in the USA!!!""

Trump's statement this week seemed to confirm industry fears that the Interior Department will block federal permits for solar and wind projects. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum took control of all permit approvals last month in a move that the American Clean Power Association criticized as ""obstruction,"" calling it ""unprecedented political review.""

The Interior Department blocking permits would slow the growth of the entire solar and wind industry, top executives at renewable developers Arevon, Avantus and Engie North America told CNBC.

Even solar and wind projects on private land may need approvals from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service if, for example, a waterway or animal species is affected, the executives told CNBC. The three power companies are among the top 10 renewable developers in the U.S., according to energy research firm Enverus.

The Interior Department ""will not give preferential treatment to massive, unreliable projects that make no sense for the American people or that risk harming communities or the environment,"" a spokesperson told CNBC when asked if new permits would be issued for solar and wind construction.

Choking off renewables will worsen a looming power supply shortage, harm the electric grid and lead to higher electricity prices for consumers, said Kevin Smith, CEO of Arevon, a solar and battery storage developer headquartered in Scottsdale, Arizona, that's active in 17 states. Arevon operates five gigawatts of power equivalent to $10 billion of capital investment.

""I don't think everybody realizes how big the crunch is going to be,"" Smith said. ""We're making that crunch more and more difficult with these policy changes.""

Uncertainty hits investment

The red tape at the Interior Department and rising costs from Trump's copper and steel tariffs have created market instability that makes planning difficult, the renewable executives said.

""We don't want to sign contracts until we know what the playing field is,"" said Cliff Graham, CEO of Avantus, a solar and battery storage developer headquartered in San Diego. Avantus has built three gigawatts of solar and storage across the desert Southwest.

""I can do whatever you want me to do and have a viable business, I just need the rules set and in place,"" Graham said.

Engie North America, the U.S. arm of a global energy company based in Paris, is slashing its planned investment in the U.S. by 50% due to tariffs and regulatory uncertainty, said David Carroll, the chief renewables officer who leads the American subsidiary. Engie could cut its plans even more, he said.

Engie's North American subsidiary, headquartered in Houston, will operate about 11 gigawatts of solar, battery storage and wind power by year end.

Multinationals like Engie have long viewed the U.S. as one of the most stable business environments in the world, Carroll said. But that assessment is changing in Engie's boardroom and across the industry, he said.

""The stability of the U.S. business market is no longer really the gold standard,"" Carroll said.

Rising costs

Arevon is seeing costs for solar and battery storage projects increase by as much as 30% due to the metal tariffs, said Smith, the CEO. Many renewable developers are renegotiating power prices with utilities to cover the sudden spike in costs because projects no longer pencil out financially, he said.

Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act ends two key tax credits for solar and wind projects in late 2027, making conditions even more challenging. The investment tax credit supported new renewable construction and the production credit boosted clean electricity generation.

Those tax credits were just passed on to consumers, Smith said. Their termination and the rising costs from tariffs will mean higher utility bills for families and businesses, he said.

The price that Avantus charges for solar power has roughly doubled to $60 per megawatt-hour as interest rates and tariffs have increased over the years, said CEO Graham. Prices will surge again to around $100 per megawatt-hour when the tax credits are gone, he said.

""The small manufacturers, small companies and mom and pops will see their electric bills go up, and it'll start pushing the small entrepreneurs out of the industry or out of the marketplace,"" Graham said.

Renewable projects that start construction by next July, a year after the One Big Beautiful Act became law, will still qualify for the tax credits. Arevon, Avantus and Engie are moving forward with projects currently under construction, but the outlook is less certain for projects later in the decade.

The U.S. will see a big downturn in new renewable power generation starting in the second half of 2026 through 2028 as new projects no longer qualify for tax credits, said Smith, the head of Arevon.

""The small- and medium-sized players that can't take the financial risk, some of them will disappear,"" Smith said. ""You're going to see less projects built in the sector.""

Artificial intelligence power crunch

Fewer renewable power plants could increase the risk of brownouts or blackouts, Smith said. Electricity demand is surging from the data centers that technology companies are building to train artificial intelligence systems. PJM Interconnection, the largest electrical grid in the U.S. that coordinates wholesale electricity in 13 states and the District of Columbia, has warned of tight power supplies because too little new generation is coming online.

Renewables are the power source that can most quickly meet demand, Smith at Arevon said. More than 90% of the power waiting to connect to the grid is solar, battery storage or wind, according to data from Enverus.

""The power requirement is largely going to be coming from the new energy sector or not at all,"" so without it, ""the grid becomes substantially hampered,"" Smith said.

Trump is prioritizing oil, gas and nuclear power as ""the most effective and reliable tools to power our country,"" White House spokesperson Anna Kelly said.

""President Trump serves the American people who voted to implement his America First energy agenda – not solar and wind executives who are sad that Biden's Green New Scam subsidies are ending,"" Kelly said.

But new natural gas plants won't come online for another five years due to supply issues, new nuclear power is a decade away and no new coal plants are on the drawing board.

Utilities may have to turn away data centers at some point because there isn't enough surplus power to run them, and no one wants to risk blackouts at hospitals, schools and homes, Arevon's Smith said. This would pressure the U.S. in its race against China to master AI, a Trump administration priority.

""The panic in the data center, AI world is probably not going to set in for another 12 months or so, when they start realizing that they can't get the power they need in some of these areas where they're planning to build data centers,"" Smith said.

""Then we'll see what happens,"" said the University of Chicago MBA, who's worked in the energy industry for 35 years. ""There may be a reversal in policy to try and build whatever we can and get power onto the grid.""",https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/107172309-1672339709035-gettyimages-1439762841-3760.jpeg?v=1752782443&w=1920&h=1080,N,,2025-08-24 10:03:28.540202

For some of SDG&E’s 1.25 million residential electric customers, the makeover will result in some cost savings.
But the change also introduces what’s called a base services charge of $24.15 on every monthly bill.
If a customer in the inland zone consumes 600 kilowatt-hours per month, their new bill will be $269, or about $8 less than under the old bill structure.
But questions about how to obtain and verify income data from customers — and potential net increases in some customers’ bills — put pressure on the CPUC.","Your San Diego Gas & Electric monthly bill is about to change, due to a controversial piece of legislation passed three years ago by lawmakers in Sacramento and later implemented by the California Public Utilities Commission.

The change will overhaul the way all the investor-owned utilities in the state structure the electric bills paid by ratepayers.

For some of SDG&E’s 1.25 million residential electric customers, the makeover will result in some cost savings. But others will end up paying more each month.

The restructuring takes a two-pronged approach: It will reduce electricity rates for residential customers by an average of 10%, or 5 cents per kilowatt-hour. But the change also introduces what’s called a base services charge of $24.15 on every monthly bill.

The lower rates are designed to encourage customers across the state to adopt electrification measures in their homes. Those include buying electric vehicles and replacing natural gas appliances with electric appliances, such as heat pumps and induction stoves.

The $24.15 base services charge covers the fixed costs of utility infrastructure, such as transformers, wires and meters, as well as customer service to deliver electricity to and from homes.

To a lesser degree, it also helps fund “public purpose programs” such as the California Alternative Rates for Energy (CARE) and the Family Electric Rates Assistance (FERA) that assist low-income customers in paying their power bills. Some 26% of SDG&E customers are enrolled in the CARE or FERA programs.

What does the change mean for a typical SDG&E customer?

It varies, according to how much electricity you consume each month, where you live (be it coastal, inland, mountain or desert climate zones) and whether you are on the CARE or FERA discount plans.

For example, a chart from SDG&E estimates that a typical residential customer living in the inland climate zone who uses 400 kilowatt-hours of electricity in a month (which is about average for SDG&E’s service territory) will have a bill of $175 under the new base services charge structure. That’s $4 more than before. CARE and FERA customers would see a $4 reduction.

If a customer in the inland zone consumes 600 kilowatt-hours per month, their new bill will be $269, or about $8 less than under the old bill structure. CARE customers consuming the same amount of electricity would see a reduction of $10 while FERA customers would see their bills drop $15.

But a low-usage customer who consumes 200 kilowatt-hours would experience a $14 increase in their monthly bill, from $84 under the old system to $98. CARE customers using 200 kWh would see a $1 increase and a FERA customer would see a $4 increase.

According to the complete chart, net increases and decreases to bills are generally the same for SDG&E customers across other climate zones and usage amounts.

How we got here

The changes came as a result of Assembly Bill 205, which passed under questionable circumstances at the end of the 2022 legislative session.

Supporters say the makeover is designed to help lower-income Californians hit by the state’s ever-rising utility bills. Critics disagree, saying the new template is counterproductive and adds to the financial burden faced by beleaguered ratepayers.

The California Public Utilities Commission, on a 4-0 vote in May 2024, spelled out the specifics of how AB 205 would be implemented by the investor-owned utilities the commission regulates — SDG&E, Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric.

The commission, known as the CPUC, insists the new billing structure does not generate new profits for utilities, saying it “simply reallocates existing costs” among customers.

“This billing adjustment that’s required by the Legislature is really, at its foundation, a key lever to propel us toward our decarbonization goals,” CPUC President Alice Busching Reynolds said on the day of the vote. She called the decision “a very incremental, but important step towards this decarbonized future.”

California has set a target to derive 100% of its electricity from carbon-free sources by 2045 if not sooner.

Who is also affected?

Since the new rate structure relates to the costs of transmitting and distributing electricity, it will apply to customers enrolled in community choice energy programs across the state. That includes the two in the San Diego area — the Clean Energy Alliance and San Diego Community Power.

It also applies to customers with rooftop solar.

The overhauled rules affect residential utility customers only, not commercial or industrial accounts. It does not pertain to the natural gas portion of customer bills — only electricity.

Supporters and critics

“If you look at where the state is looking to go — towards space and water heating, appliances, electric vehicles — we expect (electricity) usage for the typical customer to increase over time,” said Adam Pierce, SDG&E’s vice president of energy procurement and rates. “So what this structure is really doing is helping modernize this billing structure that hasn’t changed in several decades (to match) what the new energy landscape in California is going to ultimately look like.”

SDG&E and the other investor-owned utilities have long called for creating a monthly base service charge.

“This is not a novel billing structure,” Pierce said. “This is utilized across the U.S. with many electric utilities, as well as other utilities here in California that are not regulated by the CPUC.”

For example, the $24.15 figure the commission landed on was largely based on the fixed charge the Sacramento Municipal Utility District — a government-owned power company not subject to CPUC regulations — imposes on its customers.

The California Public Advocates Office, the independent consumer watchdog arm of the CPUC, is one of the groups in favor of changing billing structure.

“It’s important to have what goes into customer’s bills more accurately reflect what actually drives utility costs,” said deputy director Michael Campbell. “Very importantly, it will reduce the cost of electricity so as customers increase their electric usage and shift away from gas, it will help encourage that policy shift we’re aiming for.”

Campbell said the 10% reduction in electricity rates will particularly help customers living in hot weather areas who have little choice but to run their air conditioners for long blocks of time during the summer, sending their electricity bills soaring. Those customers often have lower incomes than those with homes along the coast.

“Their household budgets can really get stressed if you’ve got a heat wave and you’re running your AC and there’s no respite at night,” Campbell said. “Your bill can change substantially, to more than $100 from one month to the next and if you’re living paycheck to paycheck … that can be pretty hard to adjust your budget when you get that unpleasant surprise when you open the bill for the previous month’s usage.”

But other groups say changing the billing structure is a bad idea.

“The problem is that there’s not a way to really know if folks are using a lot of electricity because they have an electric car that they’re plugging in … or they’re just running their AC all day long when they don’t need to be,” said Jenn Engstrom, state director of the California Public Interest Research Group, known as CALPIRG. “I understand there could be some benefit for people who are high-electricity consumers because they’ve decided to electrify their home, but it’s going to have that same benefit for people who are just wasteful.”

Engstrom pointed to SDG&E’s examples that show low-usage customers consuming 200 kilowatt-hours of electricity will see an increase in their monthly bills and said the change is misdirected.

“What we really want to see are efforts to actually rein in some of the overspending that the utilities are doing so that they don’t have to then put that back on consumers,” she said. “Their profit rates are some of the highest in the whole country. If we just work to lower those, that would be a huge potential for savings for consumers.”

When the CPUC voted, Commissioner John Reynolds (no relation to CPUC President Alice Reynolds), said the notion that the new system will discourage customers from energy conservation was “laughable.”

“California will still have … time-of-use rates that create incentives for efficiency and conservation during peak hours and also encourage moving your usage to cheaper times of the day,” he said.

SDG&E will introduce the new billing framework in the coming weeks and it will be reflected in customer statements starting in the October billing cycle.

Southern California Edison unveils its changes in November. A spokesman for Pacific Gas & Electric, citing “challenges” due to technical issues in its rollout, said PG&E’s changes will come in March.

It’s important to note that the new billing structure is the first iteration of AB 205. The CPUC will review how the plan is working and make adjustments, if needed.

“As part of this proceeding, we’ll be doing a lot of analysis, studying and reporting back to the commission about how this is working and what potential tweaks need to be made to make this more effective in the future,” Pierce of SDG&E said.

But critics say that leaves the door open for possible increases to the price tag on the base service charge.

“There’s nothing in what the PUC approved that prevents them from raising it next year to $50 or $100,” State Senate Minority Leader Brian Jones, R-Santee, said when the change was adopted. “The PUC has unchecked power on this thing.”

The murky origins of the legislation

AB 205 passed through the Legislature under circumstances that could be described most charitably as opaque.

It zoomed through both chambers in Sacramento late in the 2022 legislative session as part of a massive omnibus, or “trailer” bill that ran 21,633 words and covered a host of other items.

Most of the floor debate focused on a section of the bill that created a strategic reliability reserve to be overseen by the California Department of Water Resources and the portion establishing a fixed monthly charge on residential electricity bills was overlooked.

AB 205 was later signed into law by Gov. Gavin Newsom.

Once it moved onto the CPUC to work out the details, the size and scope of the base service charge became a subject of fierce debate because AB 205 originally called for setting the monthly fee based on the household incomes of customers.

SDG&E, for example, initially called for monthly charges as high as $128 and then revised the figure to as much as $73 per month for upper-income earners.

But questions about how to obtain and verify income data from customers — and potential net increases in some customers’ bills — put pressure on the CPUC.

Another thing to keep in mind is that these provisions only impact federal income tax.","The White House has been promoting the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBB) as a win for working Americans. While ""no tax on tips and overtime"" and auto loan deductions certainly sound like good ways to get ahead financially, tax advisors caution that the fine print contains several surprises that could trip up uninformed taxpayers.

As one tax professional we talked to says, the OBBB's new tax rules may not work the way you think.

""People may misunderstand the new tax deductions,"" says Lisa Greene-Lewis, a CPA and tax expert for TurboTax. She warns about strict limits, income caps, and looming expiration dates. Being unaware of these details could lead to a much smaller refund than you were expecting — or even an unexpected tax bill.

Here are seven things you should know to avoid a shock at tax time.

No tax on tips? Not quite

While President Donald Trump campaigned on ""no tax on tips,"" the text of the OBBB tells a slightly different story. Tip income isn't actually tax-free now, but the bill does offer a healthy deduction.

According to Greene-Lewis, ""The [tip income] provisions are deductions which will be reported at tax time, and your savings depend on your tax rate."" For example, if you earn $5,000 in tips and fall into the 12% tax bracket, the deduction saves you $600 ($5,000 x 0.12), but it doesn't reduce your tax bill by $5,000.

The overtime deduction has a ceiling

Similar to the tip deduction, the new tax break for overtime pay is a welcome relief for hourly workers. However, there's a cap on how much you can deduct.

The new law only allows you to deduct up to $12,500 in overtime pay ($25,000 for joint filers). If you work significant overtime and earn, say, $20,000 in extra income, you'll still owe taxes on the $7,500 that's over the limit. Furthermore, as Greene-Lewis notes, the deduction ""is phased out with income over $150,000 ($300,000 for married couples filing jointly).""

The auto loan deduction is for new U.S. cars

The ability to deduct auto loan interest is back for the first time in decades, but it's not for every car buyer. This deduction is exclusively for the purchase of new vehicles assembled in the U.S.

If you buy a used car, a leased car, or a new car assembled outside the United States, you're out of luck. This detail could surprise buyers who assume any auto loan qualifies. The deduction is also capped at $10,000 in interest and, as Greene-Lewis points out, ""is phased out at income over $100,000 ($200,000 married filing jointly).""

Home energy credits are about to disappear

The Inflation Reduction Act, passed under the Biden administration, provided homeowners with a generous tax credit for making energy-efficient upgrades. The OBBB is ending this popular program.

""Homeowners should be aware that energy efficient credits for home improvements, like energy efficient windows and doors … will end for property placed in service after 2025,"" Greene-Lewis warns. If you're planning green upgrades, start now. You must have qualifying items installed and in use by December 31, 2025, to claim the credit on your 2025 tax return.

The EV tax credit ends this fall

If you've been thinking about buying an electric vehicle to claim the lucrative tax credit, you need to act fast. The OBBB eliminates this credit for cars purchased after this quarter.

""The Clean Vehicle Credit is also eliminated … for EVs purchased after September 30, 2025,"" Greene-Lewis said. Waiting for end-of-year sales could be a costly mistake, as you'll miss out on a credit worth up to $7,500 for a new EV or $4,000 for a used one.

The home office credit is back (and limited)

The OBBB reinstated the home office deduction for self-employed and small business owners, a victory for the many who live and work from their own homes. However, a fairly strict set of rules still applies. To qualify, you must use a part of your home exclusively and regularly for your business.

This means the dining room table you work from during the day and eat at with your family at night does not qualify. The IRS is very strict on the ""exclusive use"" test, a fact that could come as a shock to many who were expecting a new tax break.

The SALT cap increase has an expiration date

Homeowners in high-tax states rejoiced when the OBBB increased the State and Local Tax (SALT) deduction cap from $10,000 to $40,000. Now, they can deduct more property tax and other local levies. In the fine print, however, you'll find that this extra relief is temporary.

In fact, the provision is set to expire at the end of 2029. Starting in tax year 2030, the cap will revert to the old $10,000 limit unless Congress acts to extend it again. With no guarantees, long-term financial planning is a bit more difficult.

Bottom line

If the new OBBB tax provisions teach us anything, it's that there's often a wide gap between the headlines and real-world benefits. Understanding the rules can help you prepare yourself financially.

""Taxpayers should treat these new rules like a 'check the fine print' agreement. The headline might promise a great deal, but the real value, and the potential pitfalls, are always in the details,"" Greene-Lewis said.

Another thing to keep in mind is that these provisions only impact federal income tax. You'll still owe federal payroll taxes on tips and overtime, and you may still owe state income taxes depending on where you live.

Under the Trump administration's 2025 policy rollbacks, renewable energy incentives have been dismantled, fossil fuel subsidies expanded, and grid modernization efforts stifled. These shifts have triggered a perfect storm: electricity prices have surged by 10% since January 2025, renewable project development has stalled, and the grid's aging infrastructure is buckling under the strain of surging demand. For investors, the dilemma is clear: how to navigate a market increasingly defined by volatility, policy risk, and the urgent need for resilient infrastructure. The answer lies in strategic bets on grid modernization, distributed energy resources (DERs), and methane mitigation technologies like Ambient Carbon.

Trump's Anti-Renewable Agenda: A Policy-Driven Shockwave

The Trump administration's aggressive deregulation has reshaped energy markets. By canceling clean energy tax credits, pausing federal land permitting for wind and solar projects, and freezing programs like the Solar for All initiative, the administration has stifled innovation and investment. The consequences are stark: 64,000 renewable energy jobs lost or paused, $33.87 billion in project investments abandoned, and a 74% projected increase in wholesale electricity prices by 2026. Energy Secretary Chris Wright's attempts to blame Biden-era policies ring hollow in the face of independent analyses showing that Trump's rollbacks are the primary driver of rising costs.

For investors, this policy-driven instability signals a need to pivot away from traditional renewable energy projects and toward sectors less susceptible to regulatory whiplash.

Aging Grid Infrastructure: A $1.1 Trillion Modernization Imperative

The U.S. grid is a 100-year-old system struggling to meet 21st-century demands. From 2023 to 2025, utilities have poured $178.2 billion into grid upgrades, with $1.1 trillion projected for 2025–2029. Transmission and distribution spending now account for 67% of utility budgets, driven by the need to replace 70% of grid lines and transformers over 25 years old. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law's $73 billion in grid funding and the Grid Deployment Office's $14.5 billion in grants have accelerated modernization, but bottlenecks persist. Transformer lead times have doubled, and 2,600 gigawatts of generating capacity are stuck in interconnection queues.

Investors should prioritize companies involved in grid resilience, such as those deploying high-voltage direct current (HVDC) lines, smart grid software, and microgrid solutions. These technologies are critical for managing renewable intermittency and ensuring reliability amid extreme weather events.

Surging Data Center Demand: A Hidden Grid Strain

Data centers now consume 4.4% of U.S. electricity, a figure projected to rise to 12% by 2028. The rise of AI, cloud computing, and digital manufacturing has driven this surge, with hyperscale facilities in Virginia and Texas consuming 176 terawatt-hours annually. As data centers become a top driver of electricity demand, their energy needs strain an already stressed grid.

This trend underscores the importance of distributed energy resources (DERs) like rooftop solar, battery storage, and demand-response systems. These technologies reduce reliance on centralized grids and provide backup power during outages. For example, energy storage spending jumped from $97 million in 2022 to $723 million in 2023, signaling a shift toward decentralized solutions.

Methane Mitigation: A $15 Billion Opportunity

Methane, a greenhouse gas 80 times more potent than CO₂ over 20 years, is a critical but overlooked investment frontier. Technologies like Ambient Carbon's satellite monitoring systems and feed additives for livestock are revolutionizing methane abatement. The Global Methane Pledge, signed by 155 countries, has spurred $80–90 million in R&D funding, while the Inflation Reduction Act's Methane Emissions Reduction Program offers financial incentives for operators.

Investors should target methane mitigation startups and established players in satellite monitoring, leak detection, and agricultural innovations. These technologies not only align with global climate goals but also offer near-term profitability, as captured methane can be monetized.

Hedging Against Volatility: A Strategic Investment Playbook

To thrive in this volatile environment, investors must adopt a dual strategy:

1. Grid Modernization: Invest in companies deploying smart grid infrastructure, energy storage, and microgrids. These sectors are shielded from policy shifts and are essential for grid resilience.

2. Methane Mitigation: Allocate capital to technologies like Ambient Carbon, which offer both environmental and financial returns. The Global Methane Pledge and IRA incentives create a favorable regulatory tailwind.

3. Distributed Energy Resources: Support DERs that reduce grid dependency and provide backup power. This includes solar-plus-storage systems and AI-driven outage prediction tools.

Conclusion: Building a Resilient Energy Future

The Trump administration's anti-renewable policies have created a market ripe for disruption. While rising electricity prices and regulatory uncertainty pose risks, they also highlight opportunities in grid modernization, DERs, and methane mitigation. By pivoting toward these resilient sectors, investors can hedge against policy volatility and position themselves at the forefront of the energy transition.

Donald Trump has made several unusual moves to elongate the era of coal, such as giving the industry exemptions from pollution rules. But the gambit to keep one Michigan coal-fired power station running has been extraordinary — by forcing it to remain open even against the wishes of its operator.

The hulking JH Campbell power plant, which since 1962 has sat a few hundred yards from the sand dunes at the edge of Lake Michigan, was just eight days away from a long-planned closure in May when Trump’s Department of Energy issued an emergency order that it remain open for a further 90 days.

On Wednesday, the administration intervened again to extend this order even further, prolonging the lifetime of the coal plant another 90 days, meaning it will keep running until November — six months after it was due to close.

The move, taken under emergency powers more normally used during wartime or in the wake of disaster, has stunned local residents and the plant’s operator, Consumers Energy. “My family had a countdown for it closing, we couldn’t wait,” said Mark Oppenhuizen, who has lived in the shadow of the plant for 30 years and suspects its pollution worsened his wife’s lung disease.

“I was flabbergasted when the administration said they had stopped it shutting down,” he said. “Why are they inserting themselves into a decision a company has made? Just because politically you don’t like it? It’s all so dumb.”

The May 23 order and the latest edict, by the U.S. energy secretary, Chris Wright, both warn that the regional grid would be strained by the closure of JH Campbell with local homes and businesses at risk of “curtailments or outages, presenting a risk to public health and safety” without it.

“This order will help ensure millions of Americans can continue to access affordable, reliable, and secure baseload power regardless of whether the wind is blowing or the sun is shining,” Wright said in a statement on Thursday.

But Miso, the grid operator for Michigan and 14 other states, has stressed it has had “adequate resources to meet peak demand this summer” without JH Campbell and Consumers Energy had already set about making plans for life after its last remaining coal plant.

“What’s remarkable is that this is the first time the energy secretary has used these powers without being asked to do so by the market operator or power plant operator,” said Timothy Fox, an energy analyst at ClearView. “It shows the Trump administration is prepared to take muscular actions to keep its preferred power sources online.”

Wright — whose department has bizarrely taken to tweeting pictures of lumps of coal with the words “She’s an icon. She’s a legend” — has said the U.S. “has got to stop closing coal plants” to help boost electricity generation to meet demand that is escalating due to the growth of artificial intelligence.

The administration has also issued a separate emergency declaration to keep open a gas plant in Pennsylvania, although it has sought to kill off wind and solar projects, which Trump has called “ugly” and “disgusting.”

The president, who solicited and received major donations from coal, oil, and gas interests during his election campaign, has signed an executive order aimed at reviving what he calls “beautiful, clean coal” and took the remarkable step of asking fossil fuel companies to email requests to be exempt from pollution laws, again under emergency powers.

So far, 71 coal plants, along with dozens of other chemical, copper smelting, and other polluting facilities, have received “pollution passes” from the Trump administration according to a tally by the Environmental Defense Fund, allowing greater emissions of airborne toxins linked to an array of health problems. Coal is, despite Trump’s claims, the dirtiest of all fossil fuels and the leading source of planet-heating pollution.

Trump has launched a “political takeover of the electricity grid” to favor fossil fuels, according to Caroline Reiser, an attorney at the Natural Resources Defense Council. “The result of this will be higher electricity bills, more pollution in our communities, and a worsening climate crisis,” she added.

In Michigan, the cost of keeping JH Campbell open is set to be steep. Consumers Energy initially estimated its closure would save ratepayers $600 million by 2040 as it shifts to cheaper, cleaner energy sources such as solar and wind.

Reversing this decision costs $1 million a day in operating costs, an imposition that Midwest residents will have to meet through their bills. It is understood the company privately told outside groups it fears the administration could keep adding 90-day emergency orders for the entire remainder of Trump’s term.

“Consumers Energy continues to comply with the [Department of Energy] order and will do so as long as it is in effect,” a company spokesperson said. “We are pursuing recovery of the costs of running the Campbell plant in a proceeding currently before [the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission]. Timely cost recovery is essential.”

Should the Trump administration go further and force all of the U.S .fossil fuel plants set to retire by 2028 to continue operating, it will cost American ratepayers as much as $6 billion a year in extra bills, a new report by a coalition of green groups has found.

This would almost certainly be met by legal action — Dana Nessel, Michigan’s attorney general, has already filed a lawsuit arguing the “arbitrary and illegal order” to extend JH Campbell’s lifespan will unfairly heap costs upon households in the state.

Trump’s efforts may bear some fruit, with U.S. coal production expected to tick up slightly this year, although the longer-term trend for coal is one of decline amid cheaper gas and renewables. “The administration may slow the retirement trend although they are unlikely to stop it,” said ClearView’s Fox. “The economics don’t change, but the administration could be a savior for these plants at least while Donald Trump is in office.”

For those living next to and downwind of coal plants, there is a cost to be paid that isn’t just monetary. Tiny soot particles from burned coal can bury themselves deep into the lungs, causing potentially deadly respiratory and heart problems.

The closure of such plants can lift this burden dramatically — a recent study found that in the month after a coal facility was closed near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 2016, the number of childhood asthma visits to local hospitals declined by 41 percent and then continued to fall by about 4 percent each month.

The study shows “the closure of a major industrial pollution source can lead to immediate and lasting improvements in the lung health of the those who live nearby,” said Wuyue Yu, research co-author and postdoctoral fellow at the NYU Grossman School of Medicine.

For those living in the township of Port Sheldon, a mostly bucolic setting on the shore of the vast Lake Michigan, a pollution-free future beckoned once JH Campbell had been scheduled to close, with lofty plans for new parkland, housing and a battery plant touted for the site.

Now there is uncertainty. Last week, a few dozen residents and activists held a protest event next to the sprawling plant, which hummed and whirred in the summer heat, one 650-foot chimney puncturing the horizon, another, smaller flue striped red and white, like a candy cane.

Dozens of train cars full of coal, hastily procured after the plant’s supply was used up ahead of a closure that has been scheduled for four years, backed up in the sunshine. When burned in the huge 1.5 gigawatt plant, this coal emits about 7.7 million tons of carbon dioxide a year.

“Trump is just trying to keep the money coming into coal companies as long as he can, I suppose,” said David Hoekema, who has lived a couple of miles from the plant since 2006 and has had to clean coal dust from his windows. Trump easily won this county, called Ottawa, in last year’s election, but Hoekema said even his staunchest conservative neighbors don’t want the coal plant.

“I’ve not met anyone along the lake shore who says, ‘Oh yeah, let’s keep this open’ — even the conservative Republicans are concerned about their health,” he said. “Republican ideology says local control is best, but the Trump administration is saying, ‘We don’t care what the hell states do, we will impose our order on them.’ I know there’s a lot of competition, but this would have to be one of their craziest decisions.”

The Department of Energy did not respond to questions about its plan for JH Campbell once its latest extension expires. The battle over the coal plant’s future has taken place to a backdrop of a scorching summer in Michigan, one of its hottest on record, with algal blooms sprouting in its lakes, both symptoms of an unfolding climate crisis.

“The talk in neighborhoods has been how hot it’s been this summer — my kid was prepared to be outside every day and it’s been so hot so often it’s been irresponsible to do that,” said Stephen Wooden, a Democratic state lawmaker who added that Michigan residents are also “pissed off” about increasing power bills.

“We’re seeing the impacts of climate change daily, it is impacting our state,” Wooden said. “And this is being caused by the continuation of outdated, expensive fossil fuels that Donald Trump wants to prop up.”",https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/JHCampbell.jpg?quality=75&strip=all,N,,2025-08-24 13:03:10.710685

Strategic shifts in policy and investment are powerful engines for boosting national competitiveness, improving quality of life, and turning sustainability goals into tangible results.

Laying the groundwork

Fully aware of the importance of sustainable development, the Party and the State has issued a comprehensive set of strategic guidelines and policies. In Resolution No. 29-NQ/TW dated November 17, 2022, the 13th Central Committee of the Communist Party of Vietnam identified digital transformation and green transition as core pillars of the country’s industrialization and modernization process for the 2021-2030 period with a vision to 2045.

Decision No. 1658/QD-TTg, issued by the Prime Minister on October 1, 2021, approved the National Green Growth Strategy for 2021-2030 and Vision towards 2050. The strategy sets out goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions intensity per unit of GDP, to “green” key economic sectors, and to promote the circular economy.

Additionally, Decision No. 687/QD-TTg, dated June 7, 2022, approved the “Scheme for Circular Economy Development in Vietnam”, aiming to reduce greenhouse gas emissions intensity by at least 15 per cent by 2030 compared to 2014 and to work towards achieving net-zero emissions by 2050.

Notably, the Prime Minister’s strong commitment at COP26 in 2021 to reach net-zero emissions by 2050 marked a turning point, creating significant momentum for the entire political system and society to take action.

The Law on Environmental Protection 2020 provides a critical legal foundation, introducing for the first time regulations on the circular economy and sustainable production and consumption. The revised National Power Development Plan for 2021-2030 with a Vision to 2050 (revised PDP8), sets clear targets to accelerate the development of renewable energy sources (excluding hydropower) for electricity production, aiming for a share of 28-36 per cent by 2030. By 2050, the share of renewables is projected to reach 74-75 per cent.

In parallel, the government has introduced a range of incentive policies to support businesses in accessing preferential loans, upgrading technologies, and actively participating in the green transition.

Early progress and challenges

Following the implementation of supportive policies, Vietnam’s industrial development has witnessed positive progress. According to the Ministry of Industry and Trade, industry has consistently accounted for over 30 per cent of national GDP during the 2020-2025 period. Within this, the manufacturing and processing industry remained the primary growth engine, making up approximately 80 per cent of the industrial structure. Vietnam has gradually asserted its position as one of Asia’s manufacturing hubs and has been recognized by the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) as part of the group of middle-income industrial economies.

From 2021 to 2025, the country’s industrial sector has continued to expand, with the Index of Industrial Production (IIP) rising at an average annual rate of some 6.3 per cent. In particular, the manufacturing and processing industry is expected to grow by roughly 7.1 per cent per year, maintaining its role as the main driver of industrial growth. Its contribution to total industrial output is projected to increase from 77.2 per cent in 2021 to around 80 per cent by 2025, and it accounts for nearly 85 per cent of total exports. The industrial sector’s average growth rate remains higher than the GDP growth rate. Its internal structure has also improved, with a gradual decline in mining and a robust rise in energy, manufacturing, and processing industries.

At the same time, the energy sector has undergone a positive structural shift, notably with the rapid development of renewable energy. By 2024, renewable energy accounted for 26.8 per cent of the country’s total installed capacity and 13.4 per cent of the primary energy supply. This has not only helped stabilize electricity supply for industrial production but also driven the sector’s evolution towards green industry.

Despite these encouraging results, the Ministry of Industry and Trade acknowledges several persistent challenges in Vietnam’s industrialization process. Specifically, though the manufacturing and processing industry has been identified as the engine of economic growth, its current technological level remains significantly behind that of a modern industrialized country. Many enterprises still rely on outdated technologies, resulting in inefficiency and environmental harm, and the industry’s competitiveness remains weak compared to regional peers. With a highly open economy, Vietnam’s manufacturing sector remains heavily reliant on imports, making it vulnerable to fluctuations in the global market.

Furthermore, domestic support industries remain underdeveloped, leading to a heavy dependence on imported components and raw materials. As a result, Vietnamese manufacturing enterprises often participate only in the lower value-added segments of the supply chain, such as assembly. Localization rates remain low across many products.

Leveraging momentum

While facing many challenges, several economic experts believe that Vietnam still has opportunities and momentum to accelerate the green transformation of its industrial sector. Major export markets such as the EU are increasingly imposing stricter environmental standards, such as the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), the Emissions Trading System (ETS), and renewable energy regulations, pressuring Vietnamese enterprises to adapt in order to remain competitive.

Importantly, a green transition also presents an opportunity to attract high-quality FDI, particularly in green technologies and renewable energy. At the recent “Asia-Europe Industry Cooperation Forum”, organized by the Vietnam Association of Foreign-Invested Enterprises (VAFIE), a representative from the Foreign Investment Agency at the Ministry of Finance affirmed that Vietnam is increasingly positioning itself as a vital link in regional and global supply chains. FDI inflows from Europe have been rising rapidly, with impressive growth from the UK (up 172 per cent), Poland (up 1,000 per cent), and Luxembourg (up 1,100 per cent). This reflects the positive impact of next-generation free trade agreements (FTAs) such as the EU-Vietnam Free Trade Agreement (EUVFTA) and the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP).

In its FDI attraction strategy for the coming period, Vietnam has made clear its intent to pursue selective investment, with a focus on quality, efficiency, innovation, and sustainable development. The government is encouraging projects that incorporate high technology, deliver substantial added value, generate positive spillover effects, engage with domestic enterprises, and are environmentally friendly. Key priority sectors include high-tech industries, semiconductors, renewable energy (LNG, hydrogen, and battery technology), logistics, industrial infrastructure, innovation, and digital transformation.

Turning green challenges into opportunities

To navigate growing challenges and seize the momentum of green transformation, experts emphasize the need for coordinated, forward-looking strategies.

The first step is to review and strengthen legal and policy frameworks for green growth, ensuring consistency and practical enforcement. Green goals should be integrated into sectoral and local development plans. At the same time, Vietnam should promote green finance, through green credit, green bonds, and sustainable investment funds, to mobilize resources. The government must offer incentives, financial support, and risk-sharing mechanisms, particularly in the early phases of green investment.

Building enterprise capacity and a skilled workforce is equally crucial. Businesses should be encouraged to invest in clean technology and innovation. Workforce development should focus on green skills, environmental management, and renewable energy. Stronger collaboration between public and private sectors can help form green supply chains and support circular economy models.

Vietnam should also deepen its engagement in global sustainability initiatives and attract international capital, technology, and expertise to accelerate its transition.

Ultimately, green industrial development is a transformative journey, demanding political will, societal alignment, and business leadership. Though challenging, this path offers Vietnam the opportunity to address climate and environmental issues, boost competitiveness, and shape a prosperous, sustainable future. A successful green transformation will be a defining milestone in the country’s development journey.",,N,,2025-08-24 14:00:50.871277

That’s why it matters that Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier has opened an investigation into two powerful climate organizations: the Climate Disclosure Project (CDP) and the Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi). If you haven’t heard of them, you’re not alone. And yet, they are exerting influence and soft power over every Floridian.

Uthmeier is alleging these groups may be pressuring Florida companies into handing over proprietary business data under the guise of “environmental transparency,” and then using that data to shape investment decisions, scores and access to capital.

It’s an important move concerning an issue that has, for too long, lacked scrutiny.

CDP, a UK-based nonprofit, operates the world’s largest environmental disclosure system and sells services that help companies “improve” their ratings — while also offering positive media statements from its own executives, for a fee. Its scores are used by major financial firms like S&P Global, Bloomberg, and ISS to guide investment decisions.

SBTi, co-founded by CDP and the United Nations Global Compact, approves corporate climate targets and then refers companies back to CDP to report their progress. That cycle — validation, disclosure, scoring — creates a system where climate policy is increasingly dictated by non-governmental actors with no accountability.

Uthmeier has raised concerns that these organizations may have violated deceptive trade practices laws (and perhaps even antitrust statutes) by working in tandem with financial institutions to penalize companies that decline to participate.

This is what we see when efforts at the ballot box and legislative chamber fail — shift tactics to deploy beneath-the-surface influence and infect the business climate hoping nobody pays attention. It is nefarious and Floridians have good reason to pay attention.

For example, small businesses in Florida, like family-owned farms in the Panhandle or local manufacturers in Central Florida, are feeling the squeeze. These companies, already navigating tight margins, face pressure to comply with costly disclosure requirements or risk being blacklisted by investors and financial institutions influenced by CDP and SBTi scores. This can mean higher operating costs, reduced access to loans or lost contracts, directly impacting jobs and livelihoods.

In coastal communities, where tourism drives the economy, these opaque climate mandates could deter investment in local hotels and restaurants, raising prices for consumers and threatening the vibrant small-business ecosystem that Floridians rely on.

To be clear, there is nothing wrong with companies voluntarily adopting any practice they believe to be in their best interest. It crosses a line when private or foreign groups coerce companies into disclosing sensitive data by scoring them publicly and affecting their access to capital.

That’s why Florida’s investigation matters. It will help ensure that no Florida entrepreneur is forced to engage in practices that jeopardize the health of their business, customers and shareholders.

At the same time, the new administration in Washington is shifting its focus away from politically motivated climate handouts and toward common sense environmental stewardship: protecting clean air and water without threatening jobs, innovation or national security.

In Florida, we have a lot at stake. From tourism and agriculture to real estate and transportation, nearly every sector of our economy feels the ripple effects of top-down environmental mandates. As the national conversation about climate and ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) policies continues, it’s critical that states like ours ask the tough questions and protect consumers, companies and constitutional principles alike.

The climate cartel may operate in the shadows, but accountability begins in the sunlight. Thank you, Attorney General Uthmeier, for taking this fight on. Florida continues to lead the way.

Here's Why,"Matt Frankel, www.facebook.com",,,,,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/08/24/all-electric-vehicle-investors-need-to-mark-their/,"As part of President Donald Trump's ""big, beautiful bill,"" U.S. tax credits for electric vehicles (EVs) are set to expire after Sept. 30.

At least 40% of the critical minerals in the vehicle's battery must be produced in the U.S. or one of the U.S.'s free trade partners.
More than 130,000 new electric vehicles were sold in July, the second highest total for a single month ever, and 36,700 used electric vehicles changed hands, which was the highest number on record.","As part of President Donald Trump's ""big, beautiful bill,"" U.S. tax credits for electric vehicles (EVs) are set to expire after Sept. 30. This will be the last day to purchase a vehicle to claim the credit, which can be worth as much as $7,500 for new vehicles that qualify or $4,000 for used electric vehicles.

For example, if you buy an electric vehicle with an MSRP of $55,000, the tax break lowers the effective price to $47,500 and can make the purchase far more affordable. Importantly for electric vehicle manufacturers, the credits help EVs compete more effectively with mid-priced gasoline vehicles.

Obviously, with most vehicle manufacturers ramping up their EV strategies in recent years, this could have a significant effect. But will it be a demand-killer, or a temporary bump on the road to widespread EV adoption?

How will this affect EV manufacturers?

The short answer is: ""It depends."" For one thing, it's important to point out that the credit for new EV purchases doesn't apply to all vehicles. In order to be eligible for the credit, a vehicle must meet a few criteria:

It must be an EV or a PHEV (plug-in hybrid).

The vehicle must be manufactured in North America.

At least 50% of the vehicle's battery components must be produced or assembled in North America (to qualify for half of the credit).

At least 40% of the critical minerals in the vehicle's battery must be produced in the U.S. or one of the U.S.'s free trade partners.

The vehicle must have an MSRP below $80,000 if it's an SUV, or below $55,000 for a sedan, wagon, or hatchback.

The buyer of the vehicle must have adjusted gross income (AGI) less than $150,000 (single) or $300,000 (joint filers).

The point is that there are a lot of vehicles that don't qualify. For example, no vehicles from Lucid (LCID -3.11%) qualify, as the company's Air sedans are far in excess of the MSRP limit. No electric vehicles from BMW or Mercedes qualify, because they aren't made in North America.

In fact, there are only 20 new vehicle models that qualify, and even among those, many configurations won't qualify. For example, a Tesla Model X technically qualifies, but only with an MSRP of $80,000 or below.

Manufacturers who have EVs currently on the eligibility list for the new EV credit include:

Acura/Honda: 2 models

General Motors (GM 3.29%): 6 models

Stellantis: 2 models

Ford (F 3.44%): 1 model

Hyundai/Genesis: 3 models

Kia: 2 models

Tesla (TSLA 6.18%): 4 models

It's also worth noting that there's a ""leasing loophole"" that excludes leased EVs and PHEVs from many regulations. For example, if you lease a luxury EV that is too expensive to qualify as a purchase, you might still be able to use the credit -- until Sept. 30, that is.

Should EV investors worry?

The bottom line is that the potential effect of the tax credit's expiration varies by manufacturer. It could produce a sales dip, especially for the manufacturers listed above. However, the gap between the average cost of an EV and the average cost of a gas-powered vehicle has narrowed in recent years, so the manufacturers focused on producing affordable models could be OK.

Other automakers -- like Lucid -- won't be negatively affected at all. If anything, it could be a net positive for them, as the lack of available tax credits on lower-priced models could make some buyers consider luxury brands more than they otherwise would.

We're already seeing EV sales spike in anticipation of the credit's expiration. More than 130,000 new electric vehicles were sold in July, the second highest total for a single month ever, and 36,700 used electric vehicles changed hands, which was the highest number on record.",https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/829594/ev-charging-2024.jpg,N,,2025-08-24 09:03:34.419421

For now, the Revolution Wind saga exemplifies the tension between short-term policy whims and long-term energy needs, leaving developers in limbo as court battles loom.","The Trump administration’s abrupt halt to construction on the Revolution Wind offshore farm marks a dramatic escalation in its campaign against renewable energy initiatives. On August 23, 2025, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) issued a stop-work order for the project, which is 80% complete and poised to power hundreds of thousands of homes in Rhode Island and Connecticut. This move, affecting a $1.5 billion venture led by Danish firm Ørsted and Eversource Energy, underscores President Trump’s longstanding antagonism toward wind power, which he has derided as unreliable and environmentally harmful.

The order cites a need for further review under executive directives issued earlier in the year, including a January 20 memorandum that temporarily withdrew all Outer Continental Shelf areas from offshore wind leasing. According to NPR, the project was on track to begin delivering electricity next year, generating enough power for 350,000 households while creating thousands of jobs in manufacturing and installation.

Policy Roots and Early Actions

Trump’s hostility to offshore wind traces back to his campaign promises, where he vowed to end such projects on “day one” to prioritize fossil fuels and reduce what he calls burdensome regulations. Upon taking office, he signed an executive order pausing new leases and permits, as detailed in a White House memorandum that initiated a comprehensive review of federal practices. This has led to widespread delays, with the Interior Department imposing new layers of political oversight on approvals, per reporting from The New York Times.

Industry insiders note that these actions extend beyond offshore wind, targeting solar and onshore projects as well. For instance, the administration has withdrawn millions of acres of federal waters from leasing and opened investigations into bird fatalities at wind farms, amplifying concerns among developers about investment viability.

Economic and Environmental Fallout

The Revolution Wind halt threatens significant economic repercussions, including the loss of over 2,000 construction jobs and disruptions to supply chains reliant on domestic steel and turbine components. Advocates argue it undermines state climate goals; Rhode Island officials estimate the farm would cut carbon emissions equivalent to removing 100,000 cars from roads annually. As The Guardian reports, governors from Rhode Island and Connecticut have vowed legal challenges, labeling the order a direct assault on clean energy progress.

Globally, this policy shift ripples through renewable markets. European investors, who dominate U.S. offshore wind, face heightened risks, with costs already 30% higher than in Europe due to regulatory hurdles. Posts on X from energy analysts highlight growing sentiment that Trump’s moves favor oil and gas subsidies, potentially inflating consumer energy bills despite pledges to lower them.

Industry Reactions and Legal Battles

Renewable energy firms like Ørsted have expressed frustration, warning that repeated halts erode investor confidence and could strand billions in sunk costs. The American Clean Power Association has criticized the administration for prioritizing ideology over energy security, pointing to data showing wind’s cost-competitiveness—unsubsidized onshore wind at $38–78 per megawatt-hour versus new gas plants at $48–107, as per a 2025 Lazard report summarized by Reuters.

Legal experts anticipate swift court challenges, with states arguing the stop-work order violates prior approvals and the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act. Meanwhile, supporters like Congressman Jeff Van Drew praise the pause for protecting marine life and local economies from what they deem unproven technology.

Broader Implications for U.S. Energy Strategy

This episode fits into Trump’s broader energy agenda, which includes gutting tax credits for renewables via August 2025 Treasury rules, as noted in posts on X and coverage from HuffPost. Critics warn it could slow the U.S. transition to net-zero emissions, ceding ground to China in clean tech dominance.

Looking ahead, the administration’s review may lead to permanent bans or scaled-back leasing, but bipartisan support for renewables in red states—where wind powers 63% of Iowa’s grid—suggests political pushback. For now, the Revolution Wind saga exemplifies the tension between short-term policy whims and long-term energy needs, leaving developers in limbo as court battles loom.",https://www.webpronews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/xai-tmp-imgen-1c3778bb-281b-40d0-86ae-96ee461fc656.jpeg,N,,2025-08-24 12:06:31.806802

Researchers and companies are leveraging AI to sift through massive datasets, predict material behaviors, and optimize designs at speeds unimaginable a decade ago. This isn’t just incremental progress; it’s a paradigm shift that’s compressing years of R&D into months, according to industry experts.

Take, for instance, the work at Microsoft, where AI models have identified over 500,000 potential new battery materials by analyzing chemical properties and stability factors. This computational prowess is slashing the time needed for discovery, traditionally a painstaking lab process. As detailed in a recent Fast Company report, such innovations are “supercharging” the race for longer-lasting batteries, with AI enabling simulations that predict how materials will perform under real-world stresses like extreme temperatures or rapid charging cycles.

AI’s Role in Material Discovery

Beyond materials, AI is revolutionizing battery manufacturing. Machine learning algorithms are now optimizing production lines, reducing defects and energy waste by analyzing sensor data in real time. A report from IDTechEx, published earlier this year, highlights how AI-driven automation is disrupting supply chains, forecasting a market growth to $19.4 billion by 2034 as per InsightAce Analytic’s analysis. This integration allows for predictive maintenance, where AI anticipates equipment failures before they halt assembly, ensuring higher yields of advanced lithium-ion and solid-state batteries.

In the realm of electric vehicles (EVs), AI is tackling one of the biggest pain points: charging efficiency. Companies like Tesla are experimenting with AI-optimized battery management systems (BMS) that dynamically adjust charging rates to extend lifespan and prevent overheating. Recent posts on X from industry watchers, such as those discussing Huawei’s patented solid-state battery with claims of 3,000km range and five-minute charging, underscore the buzz around these advancements, though experts caution that real-world scalability remains a challenge.

Enhancing Charging Infrastructure

Quantum computing’s intersection with AI is another frontier, as explored in a white paper from TCS on AI and quantum technologies shaping EV batteries. By simulating molecular interactions at unprecedented scales, these tools are uncovering alternatives to lithium, like sodium-based chemistries that promise cheaper, more abundant options. SciTechDaily recently reported on AI discovering materials that could obsolete lithium-ion tech, potentially revolutionizing energy storage with higher densities and faster recharge times.

Meanwhile, AI is making charging smarter and more adaptive. Virta’s blog details how AI predicts charger faults and balances grid demand, integrating with systems like smart grids to optimize energy flow during peak hours. This is crucial as data centers and EVs strain power infrastructures; X posts from analysts like Shay Boloor highlight companies such as Tesla’s Megapack for utility-scale storage, addressing AI-driven energy bottlenecks.

Sustainability and Recycling Gains

Sustainability is a core benefit, with AI enhancing battery recycling processes. Global Batteries notes that machine learning models analyze degradation patterns to recover materials more efficiently, reducing environmental impact. Batteries News covered a breakthrough where AI accelerated the discovery of new materials, cutting development cycles dramatically.

Looking ahead to 2035, IDTechEx forecasts significant disruptions in battery usage, from AI-optimized lifespans in consumer devices to grid-level innovations. Yet challenges persist: ethical AI use, data privacy in smart charging networks, and the need for robust regulations. As one X post from Dr. Singularity put it, AI could “solve all our problems” in battery science by enabling alternatives using abundant elements, but integration with existing infrastructure will determine success.

Market Implications and Future Outlook

The economic stakes are high. InsightAce Analytic projects an 18.9% CAGR for AI-driven battery tech through 2034, driven by collaborations between tech giants and automakers. GlobeNewswire’s report on integrated battery innovations mentions 34 new technologies released this year, with 17 vehicle models adopting them, signaling rapid commercialization.

The breakthrough could help stabilize the modern power grid as it supports cleaner energy sources, like solar and wind.

Developed by a team of researchers from West Virginia University, the fuel cell can store and make electricity — the primary perk of fuel cells. But this new design can withstand the long-term heat and steam required for power generation that most can't do. It could help power systems move away from polluting fossil fuels, which are major contributors to heart and lung health issues.

The development and testing of the new fuel cell were detailed in Nature Energy. Ultimately, the team was able to run the fuel cell for 5,000 hours at 600 degrees Celsius, or more than 1,100 degrees Fahrenheit. That far surpasses previous fuel cells, which researcher Xingbo Liu said previously ran stably for a maximum of 1,833 hours.

""This is how we achieve balance in a power grid that's evolving to incorporate intermittent, sustainable sources of energy,"" explained Liu.

The U.S. grid is incorporating cleaner energy, which could account for 93% of power plant construction in 2025. But with more renewable energy on the grid comes a mismatch between energy supply and demand. Solar and wind, for example, don't produce energy on a fixed schedule because sunshine and wind aren't constant.

That's why hydrogen energy from fuel cells is important. Hydrogen can store excess energy produced by these methods for long periods, keeping it available during lower generation times. Fuel cells can switch between producing and storing energy to smooth out those fluctuations. That's why they work so well with solar panels, which need support to power homes after dark.

This technology will be essential for a clean, reliable, and affordable grid as more variable renewable power comes online.

""We showed that it's possible to make, on a large scale, CCS [carbon capture and storage] fuel cells that will stay strong and stable under intense conditions,"" said Hanchen Tian, the WVU team's lead researcher.

The Perfect Storm of Delays The Trump administration's aggressive stance on offshore wind has been a seismic shock to the industry.
New Jersey's “transmission-first” strategy, for instance, prioritizes grid infrastructure to support its 11,000 MW offshore wind target by 2040.
Similarly, Rhode Island and Connecticut have pledged legal support for Revolution Wind, framing offshore wind as a non-negotiable pillar of energy security.
The Road Ahead: Caution and Opportunity The U.S. offshore wind sector is at a crossroads.","The U.S. offshore wind sector, once heralded as a cornerstone of the nation's clean energy transition, now finds itself in a precarious position. Political headwinds, regulatory turbulence, and economic pressures have collided to stall projects that were once seen as near-certainties. Yet, amid the chaos, a clearer picture is emerging of how investors can navigate this volatile landscape—and why the sector's long-term potential remains compelling for those willing to adapt.

The Perfect Storm of Delays

The Trump administration's aggressive stance on offshore wind has been a seismic shock to the industry. The January 2025 executive order halting new permitting and leasing, coupled with retroactive scrutiny of ongoing projects like Ørsted's $4 billion Revolution Wind, has created a climate of uncertainty. Revolution Wind, 80% complete and poised to power 350,000 homes, now faces a $9.4 billion funding gap after being forced to halt construction. This case underscores a broader pattern: federal policies weaponized under vague “national security” justifications, such as claims of “exclusive economic zone interference,” have left developers scrambling for clarity.

Economic factors compound these challenges. Inflation, high interest rates, and pandemic-driven supply chain bottlenecks have inflated project costs, forcing companies like Ørsted, Equinor, and Shell to take massive impairments. Meanwhile, the collapse of tax credit programs under Trump's July 2024 megabill has left developers without critical financial tools to attract private capital.

State-Level Resilience: A Ray of Hope

While federal policies have sown chaos, state governments are stepping in to fill the void. New Jersey's “transmission-first” strategy, for instance, prioritizes grid infrastructure to support its 11,000 MW offshore wind target by 2040. The state's approval of the Leading Light Wind and Attentive Energy Two projects, alongside the development of the New Jersey Wind Port, signals a commitment to building regional supply chains. Similarly, Rhode Island and Connecticut have pledged legal support for Revolution Wind, framing offshore wind as a non-negotiable pillar of energy security.

Maine's struggles, however, highlight the risks of overreliance on federal policy. The state's indefinite postponement of its offshore wind power purchase agreement—due to shifting federal priorities—has derailed its 100% clean energy by 2040 goal. These divergent state responses illustrate a critical lesson: resilience in the sector will depend on localized strategies that hedge against federal volatility.

Strategic Diversification: The Investor's Playbook

For investors, the key to long-term resilience lies in diversification—both geographic and technological. While U.S. offshore wind remains fraught with risk, European projects and complementary technologies like grid infrastructure and battery storage offer safer havens. The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022, though not a panacea, provides a lifeline through tax credits and incentives. Companies like NextEra Energy and Ørsted, which are leveraging IRA benefits to offset federal uncertainty, may emerge stronger.

Infrastructure-focused investments also present lower-risk opportunities. Transmission lines, port logistics, and marine research initiatives (like New Jersey's Offshore Wind Research and Monitoring Initiative) are less susceptible to political whims and offer steady returns. For example, the NJ Wind Port's development is already attracting ancillary industries, creating a self-sustaining ecosystem.

The Road Ahead: Caution and Opportunity

The U.S. offshore wind sector is at a crossroads. While the Biden administration's 30 GW by 2030 target now seems unattainable (with current projections at 16.4 GW), the underlying demand for clean energy remains robust. Investors must balance caution with optimism:

Diversify Exposure: Reduce reliance on U.S. offshore wind by allocating capital to European projects or complementary technologies.

Leverage IRA Incentives: Prioritize projects that align with IRA tax credits to mitigate financial risks.

Monitor Policy Cycles: Stay attuned to potential shifts in federal policy, particularly if the 2026 election brings a return to pro-renewables leadership.

Support State-Level Innovation: Invest in states like New Jersey and Rhode Island, which are building resilient, localized energy ecosystems.

Conclusion

The U.S. offshore wind sector is no longer a sure bet, but it remains a vital piece of the global energy puzzle. Delays and cancellations have exposed vulnerabilities, yet they've also revealed pathways to resilience. For investors willing to navigate the turbulence with strategic foresight, the sector offers a unique blend of risk and reward—one that could redefine the future of renewable energy infrastructure. The question isn't whether offshore wind will succeed, but who will adapt fastest to the new reality.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-24 20:00:10.235994

With U.S. President Donald Trump's ""Made in America"" agenda and high tariffs on imports, more firms are choosing Texas as a U.S. base, insiders said.

Chen Shih-hsiu (陳世修), head of the Taiwanese Chambers of Commerce in North America, said that most Taiwanese firms are clustered in Houston and Dallas. Major investments include GlobalWafers, Delta Electronics, and System Electronics.

Dallas is particularly attractive, Chen said, because of its diverse industries, strong supply chains, and location at the center of North America.

Tax-free trade under the Agreement between the United States of America, the United Mexican States, and Canada (USMCA) also adds to its appeal, he said.

Texas data shows Taiwanese firms have announced 15 projects in the state over the past decade, totaling nearly US$11.2 billion and creating 3,550 jobs.

Electronics giants such as Foxconn, Compal, Quanta, Wistron, and Pegatron have already set up operations in Texas, Chen said, adding that suppliers of screws and plastics are also considering entry, drawn by cheap land, strong transport links, and no state income tax.

Beyond manufacturing, Texas is gaining ground in AI and space technology. For example, Taiwan-based Phison Electronics is working with local partners to develop the world's first data center in space.

Houston is a hub for space industries, and storing sensitive data in orbit avoids geopolitical risks, Phison's U.S. chief executive Wu Tsung-cheng said, calling it a rare chance for Taiwanese firms to join America's cutting-edge technology industry development.

With Tesla, AMD, HP, and Dell already in Texas, Wu said the state is becoming a tech magnet despite uncertainty over U.S. tariff policy.

Still, costs are rising quickly. Texas accounts for 36 percent of U.S. semiconductor manufacturing, but rapid growth has pushed up wages, housing, and property taxes.

""Salaries here are now close to California levels,"" warned Wang Rong-bang (王榮邦), head of Taiwan-based TECO Electric & Machinery Co.'s automation division.

Taiwanese companies aiming to establish a U.S. presence must adapt, said IntelliEPI Chairman Kao Yung-chung (高永中), as investing in the U.S. will always be more costly and take longer than in Taiwan.

""Taiwanese firms need to treat their U.S. operations as American companies, not just extensions of Taiwan,"" and it is unrealistic if companies expect to bring all their personnel from Taiwan, he added.",https://imgcdn.cna.com.tw/Eng/WebEngPhotos/1024/2025/20250824/1397x768_436440062419.jpg,N,,2025-08-24 10:04:21.216355

“Nuclear power’s safety is a scientific issue, and safety cannot be resolved by a single referendum,” Lai said.
“If future technology is safer, less nuclear waste, and more accepted by society, we will not rule out advanced nuclear energy.” The Maanshan facility was Taiwan’s last one in operation before it was closed in May.
Without nuclear power, Taiwan will likely need to increase its reliance on imported fuel such as liquefied natural gas to meet the needs of energy-intensive sectors including chip manufacturing.","A referendum to restart a Taiwan nuclear plant failed due to poor voter turnout, dealing a blow to attempts by some groups to revive atomic power after the government shut all reactors.

President Lai Ching-te said the referendum on Saturday failed after fewer than 25% of eligible voters voted in favor of restarting the Maanshan nuclear plant. At a briefing on Saturday evening, Lai acknowledged the expectations of Taiwanese residents for power stability.

“Nuclear power’s safety is a scientific issue, and safety cannot be resolved by a single referendum,” Lai said. “If future technology is safer, less nuclear waste, and more accepted by society, we will not rule out advanced nuclear energy.”

The Maanshan facility was Taiwan’s last one in operation before it was closed in May. While Saturday’s failed referendum helps cement the ruling party’s goal of phasing out nuclear power due to safety concerns, there is an ongoing atomic renaissance for the rest of the world as countries try to meet surging demand for stable, low-carbon power.

Without nuclear power, Taiwan will likely need to increase its reliance on imported fuel such as liquefied natural gas to meet the needs of energy-intensive sectors including chip manufacturing.

Proponents of atomic power have argued that turning Maanshan back on could reduce that dependence and ensure energy supplies, especially with consumption set to grow about 13% by 2030. It would also shore up energy security in the event of a military blockage by China, they said.

Ahead of the referendum, the chief executive officer of chip giant Nvidia Corp., Jensen Huang, highlighted Taiwan’s need for abundant cheap energy and touted nuclear power as an “excellent option” during a whistle stop trip to Taipei.

To stay competitive, meet rising energy demand, stop utility bills from soaring, and tackle aging infrastructure, we need more clean energy, battery storage, and energy efficiency, not less.
Clean energy is and must be our future.","Over the past decade, the United States has turned technologies into tools that strengthened our economy, delivered good-paying union jobs, cleaned up our air and water, conserved our precious natural resources, and saved families money all across our country. Yet now the country is choosing to cede that leadership, letting China dominate and control the clean-energy market across the world. It’s no surprise that people are scratching their heads, wondering what happened.

Our president is obsessed with fossil fuels. He wants to resuscitate what everyone knows is a dying coal sector while turning a blind eye to the health, environmental, and economic downsides of the climate crisis. Coupled with inconsistent threats of increased tariffs against virtually all our allies, he has isolated the US and amplified threats to global security.

The president’s giant budget bill, signed right before the horrific floods in Texas, North Carolina, and New Mexico, ignores threats to communities from escalating climate risks while it cuts healthcare, raises energy costs, and puts the safety of our loved ones in harm’s way. And the administration’s executive orders, Environmental Protection Agency announcements, and efforts to gut our federal workforce make it abundantly clear our federal leaders are not working for the American people.

But I have never been one to back down from a challenge, certainly not when it comes to protecting my kids and grandkids. And I am not alone. Millions of Americans across the country have no intention of letting this administration dictate our fate at home or abroad. We simply refuse to let this be the United States of America.

States and institutions are still fighting in court when this administration disregards science and weakens federal efforts to protect people and our environment. Folks are still listening and speaking up at neighborhood gatherings, town hall meetings, and public hearings on issues like the weakening of air, water, and power plant pollution rules that increase risks to families. They are still fighting for our lives, our communities, and our democracy.

States, cities, and local communities have authority to act boldly and work with industries to advance market innovation and install clean energy that creates jobs and lowers the cost of living for families. They still have clean vehicle fleets for cities to purchase and EV charging projects to pursue. They still have tax credits for solar, wind, and batteries. There’s more than a decade of geothermal and battery storage tax credits available for cities, schools, and health clinics, as well as many more clean energy opportunities we can and must grab.

California, the fourth largest economy in the world, ran on clean energy for 219 days last year. Florida built more large-scale solar infrastructure than California last year. Even in oil country, Texas is setting records for solar, wind, and battery capacity.

More than 40 states have green banks and clean energy financing institutions. Twenty-four states are committed to the goals of the Paris climate agreement. They’re developing bilateral climate partnerships with countries that understand the threat of the climate crisis and the opportunity that clean energy provides.

US leaders I have worked with for decades during international climate negotiations continue to work with colleagues in the United Nations, the European Union, India, China, development banks, and the private sector to identify policies and strategies that allow the world to mobilize capital for climate projects. Why? Because the cost of not investing in resilience and decarbonization is far too high.

Mike Bloomberg and Bloomberg Philanthropies have given our country a seat at the global table. America Is All In, partnering with the US Climate Alliance, Climate Mayors, Ceres, and others, will be at the forthcoming UN climate negotiations in Brazil to showcase leadership on infrastructure, transportation, buildings, land use, and more that protects our communities and cuts pollution.

Mayors and governors will use this platform to inform negotiations, build new partnerships, and pursue creative financing for more projects at home, while US investors continue to explore opportunities to address the heartbreaking food and water challenges across the global south.

Eighty-four per cent of corporations are standing by their commitments to cut carbon pollution, and 37% are increasing their ambitions, according to PwC, because they know that climate solutions are good for business. The first quarter of 2025 was the second-strongest ever for U.S. clean energy, representing $10bn in domestic investments. Across the globe, investments in clean tech are slated to reach $2.2tn this year, twice the amount for coal, gas, and oil.

To stay competitive, meet rising energy demand, stop utility bills from soaring, and tackle aging infrastructure, we need more clean energy, battery storage, and energy efficiency, not less. These technologies are cheaper to build and operate than fossil fuels. Ninety-three percent of new electric-generating capacity this year is projected to come from solar, wind, and batteries, according to Trump’s own energy department.

Facts are facts. No matter how much the administration tries to prop up the fossil fuel industry, US states, cities, communities, businesses, and institutions know that the world is not as Trump defines it. Clean energy is and must be our future.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3836e7bd7c62757413a6dd34041f97c519b529d5/560_0_5600_4480/master/5600.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=3e5c87eebaec126fcdb450f9a6f02937",N,,2025-08-24 08:01:30.181361

This year, hurricane season threatens to be more intense than ever: the combination of warming oceans and severe cuts to the NOAA and FEMA will create any number of perfect storms. People will die and others will be made homeless. As Hurricane Erin, the first major challenge of the summer, approaches, the ability to foresee and respond is reduced: fewer resources and personnel, less surveillance, more risks for everyone. How can anybody deny this? It’s like defaulting on insurance just as a tornado is coming.

At the same time, Trump will drive pollution levels up by exempting some coal plants from meeting even the most basic standards, as well as by stopping renewable projects on agricultural land, despite the fact that they occupy only 0.05% of the total, according to USDA studies; all under the cynical argument of “protecting farmers.” In reality, his policies are stripping citizens of clean air, cheaper energy and a stable economic future.

Real Clear Wire

Articles addressing energy and climate topics in The New York Times (NYT) increasingly include inaccurate data and false information. The problem is compounded by the paper’s failure to follow its own corrections policy when errors are called to its attention.

Readers look to the NYT to deliver well-reasoned and fact-checked information and analysis in areas where they are not themselves experts. However, based on my professional focus on data and analysis of energy and related environmental issues over the past 45 years, which includes White House and Department of Energy senior positions in the Carter, Bush 41, Clinton, Bush 43, Obama, and Trump 45 administrations as well as work at leading universities and think tanks, NYT coverage of these subjects too often fails to live up to its own standards for accuracy and journalistic integrity.

As a lifetime reader of the NYT, the frequency of errors and a refusal to fix them raises doubts regarding the accuracy of information presented on other topics. Whether or not the problem extends beyond energy and climate, the NYT readership clearly deserves better.

Three recent NYT articles illustrate the problem: a July 22 article by Max Bearak, ostensibly reporting on remarks by UN Secretary-General Guterres’ on renewable energy; a May 26 article by Ivan Penn on competition between electric vehicles (EVs) and vehicles powered by internal combustion engine (ICEVs); and an April 23 column by David Wallace-Wells on the loss of cultural and political momentum for action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. These are considered in turn below, followed by some summary conclusions.

Max Bearak’s July 22 2025 article “U.S. Is Missing the Century’s ‘Greatest Economic Opportunity,’ U.N. Chief Says” (July 23 print edition).

The article opens with a review of UN Secretary-General Guterres’ remarks promoting renewable energy investment as both an economic opportunity and an environmental imperative. With deft mixing of quoted and unquoted words, Bearak reports that Guterres explicitly criticized the U.S. and other countries that follow its policies on fossil fuels. Though that may well be the Secretary-General opinion, that view is not borne out in the as-delivered transcript of his remarks.

The bulk of the article turns to a discussion of energy data and climate policy that attempts to explain why the current situation has arisen, noting that this material was “left unsaid” by Mr. Guterres. From this point forward the reporter’s own analysis seeks to establish that China, in contrast to the U.S., is constructively pursuing a green energy transition. Unfortunately, the article presents faulty and misleading data.

In seeking to highlight China’s constructive role the article states “Over the past decade, China has gone from a largely coal-powered economy to one that is deploying more renewable energy than anywhere else.” Growth in China’s production and deployment of a wide range of renewable energy technologies is indeed very impressive. However, data in the 2025 Statistical Review of Word Energy (a widely-respected source of energy data available online here), show that China is still largely powered by coal. In 2024 coal provided 58.1% of China’s total energy use (92.2 out of 158.9 exajoules), while in 2014 it accounted for 69.8% of China’s energy use (82.1 out of 117.6 exajoules). (FYI, 1 exajoule = 947.8 trillion British Thermal Units).Thus, coal still dominates in China’s energy mix, although coal use grew more slowly than total energy use over the past decade.

Following its discussion of China’s renewable energy progress, the article turns to energy use and production the U.S. and other rich countries. It incorrectly states that “Relatively wealthy countries like the U.S., Canada, Australia and Saudi Arabia are also the world’s biggest producers of fossil fuels.” Data in the 2025 Statistical Review show that China’s total production of coal, oil, and natural gas totaled 112.3 exajoules in 2024, 32% higher than that of the second leading producer, the U.S., which totaled 85.0 exajoules. Indeed, China’s production of coal (94.5 exajoules) alone exceeds the total fossil fuel production of any other country. Moreover, the 2024 data is no anomaly; China has been by far the world’s largest fossil fuel producer in every year since 2005.

Despite having contacted the NYT corrections team and the author to point out these errors, as well as the article’s mischaracterization of the temperature-related aim of the 2015 Paris Agreement, no corrections have been made to date.

Ivan Penn’s May 26 2025 article “Electric Vehicles Died a Century Ago: Could that Happen Again?” (May 27 print edition).

The article draws a parallel between the current competition between electric vehicles (EVs) and those with internal combustion engines (ICEVs) and the competition between them at the dawn of the automobile age. According to the article “scholars who have studied the earlier age of electric vehicles see parallels in their demise in the early decades of the 1900s and the attacks they are facing now. In both eras, electric cars struggled to gain acceptance in the marketplace and were undermined by politics.”

Actions taken since the start of the Trump Administration to eliminate EV subsidies and to modify mandates and regulations that would have forced very rapid rates of EV adoption do matter.These actions are widely expected to slow, but not stop, EV market share growth, compared to the outlook assuming a continuation of Biden-era policies. However, available data and research clearly refute the claim that the market extinction of EVs a hundred year ago can be attributed to lawmakers of that era having “put their thumbs on the scale — and coming out on the side of oil” by enacting a very generous oil depletion allowance in 1926.

The oil policy changes discussed in the article cannot have played a major role in the demise of EVs a century ago because EVs were already on their deathbed before they occurred. Data on vehicle manufacturing and registrations show that at least 98%, and possibly more than 99%, of the 17.5 million vehicles registered to operate in 1925 were already ICEVs. The article avoids recognizing that reality, which directly undercuts its line of argument.

The Department of Energy’s History of Electric Cars paper, prepared during the Obama Administration, specifically notes that the market share of EV sales peaked in 1899 and 1900 and declined thereafter, while the absolute level of EV production peaked in 1912 and declined thereafter. The early peaking of both EV market share and production occurred against the backdrop of explosive growth in both annual vehicle sales (from 4,200 in 1900 to 181,000 in 1910 and 3.74 million in 1925) and total vehicle registrations (from 8000 in 1900 to 459,000 in 1910 to 17.5 million in 1925). The History of Electric Cars paper also identifies the four major drivers of the EV decline in the early 20th century: improved roads, which favored ICEVs that could offer long range capability; oil discoveries in Texas that led to lower gasoline prices; the invention of the electric starter, which eliminated the need for a hand crank to start ICEVs; and mass production of ICEVs, which dramatically lowered their cost. The 1926 oil tax policy change does not make the list. Indeed, it is not even mentioned in the paper.

Federal policy can sometimes be a key driver of energy market outcomes, as has arguably been the case with the Price Anderson Act that enabled commercial nuclear power, the Natural Gas Act, and renewable fuel content mandates. That said, the fate of EVs a century ago shows that federal policies are not always a significant factor in market outcomes. Today’s EV advocates can draw solace from that point, since modern EVs have many positive attributes that should favor continued EV market share growth, and perhaps a future market-leading role, even with the recent removal of some policy stimulants.

David Wallace-Wells’ April 23, 2025 article, “The World Seems to Be Surrendering to Climate Change” (subsequently revised twice).

Wallace-Wells discusses the declining cultural and political momentum for ambitious action to limit greenhouse gas emissions in recent years, noting that this trend applies both domestically and globally.

In closing, the article observes that when climate advocates reckon with the loss of cultural and political momentum they often point to green records set each year. After reviewing some of these recent records and pointing out that a staggering share of global progress is taking place in China, Wallace-Wells notes that progress in the U.S. can be similarly breathtaking. It is here that problems in both the data cited and in the NYT corrections process are clearly evident.

In describing U.S. green energy progress, the original version of the article stated that electricity generation from renewables exceeded that from fossil fuels in 2024, which is woefully incorrect. Data readily available from the U.S. Energy Information Administration website and many other sources show that renewables provided 20% of 2024 US generation compared to 60% from fossil fuels.

The NYT did issue a correction, but the initial one it posted on April 25 claimed that monthly electricity generated by renewables in the U.S. exceeded the amount generated using fossil fuels for the first time in March. That updated claim was also wrong, as fossil generation substantially exceeded renewable generation in both March 2024 and March 2025. When this new error was called to its attention, the paper issued a further correction, still dated April 25, that now appears on its website. The final correction took an approach that is simultaneously misleading for readers and instructive regarding how hard the NYT strives to avoid issuing clear substantive corrections that may embarrass its authors or cast doubt on its preferred narratives. Rather than simply strike the original errant point or its errant replacement, which are not at all central to the main focus of the article, the second correction reframes it as a comparison between generation from clean sources and fossil fuels. The trick here is that “clean sources” evidently includes include nuclear generation, which provides roughly 20% of U.S. generation, to finally make the comparison valid. However, nuclear is not once mentioned in the article or in the final correction note, which even suggests that the original article was also comparing generation from clean sources and fossil fuels. The losers here are the general readers, who would likely assume that “clean sources” is simply a synonym for “renewables” and never know that they had been badly misled.

Conclusion

Unfortunately, I could go on – the three articles reviewed above are only examples of a larger problem that has been evident for some time.

The NYT, which has a very deep bench of staff who specialize in energy and climate matters, including the authors of these articles, must do better. Bearak should be able to correctly identify the world’s largest fossil fuel producer and coal’s continuing role as the dominant energy source in China. Penn should be able to recognize that history does not support the notion that EV developments today are repeating, or even closely rhyming with, the history of EVs a century ago. The temptation to craft tidy morality fable or reprise the origins dubious oil depletion policy first introduced in the mid-1920s that provided a huge windfall to the oil industry does not grant a license to posit a clearly invalid parallelism. The editors overseeing these articles also bear responsibility.

Finally, even when factual errors do slip into articles, a sound and well-implemented corrections policy can greatly mitigate the damage. The stated NYT correction policy that “when we learn of a mistake, we acknowledge it with a correction” is sound, but its current implementation is atrocious. The so-called Grey Lady of journalism should be blushing in shame. The paper quickly corrects errors that are of minor importance to most readers, such as misspelled names, incorrect job titles, or inaccurate event dates. However, when substantive factual errors are identified and reported to the paper, as in the examples discussed above, its response is to either stonewall, as in the case of the Bearak article, or to obfuscate and evade, as in its correction of the comparison of renewable and fossil fuel generation levels in the Wallace-Wells article. In the latter case, the common observation that the cover-up is often worse than the crime clearly applies.

The NYT must always remember that the purpose of corrections is to inform the reader of what is actually true, rather than to protect its writers from embarrassment or protect preferred narratives that cannot withstand scrutiny.

Extreme weather poses significant health risks, including heat illness, mosquito-borne diseases, and respiratory problems.

The EPA's proposed repeal of the endangerment finding threatens the legal framework for regulating climate-warming gases.

Congressional action is needed to defend the endangerment finding and protect public health and safety.

It’s no secret to anyone that extreme weather is on the rise here in Florida, around the nation and across the globe.

Pew Research Center recently found that 74% of Americans say they’ve experienced at least one form of extreme weather in the past 12 months.

Clearly, risks are increasing. Scientists and government data tell us that our warming climate is making extreme weather events more frequent and intense.

These are not natural disasters as we’ve traditionally labeled them. Rather, they are unnatural disasters because pollution from burning fossil fuels is warming the atmosphere at alarming rates and ratcheting up extreme weather.

The CLEO Institute just hosted a discussion on this increasing challenge with two experts on the topic. You can access a recording of the conversation by visiting bit.ly/extremeweatherontherise.

A fixture in South Florida news for decades, John Morales, now hurricane specialist at WTVJ NBC6 in Miami (having previously served as chief meteorologist), kicked off the discussion about his real-world observations from his perch as a meteorologist.

John — an honorary member of the American Meteorological Society — voiced concerns that budget cuts at agencies like the National Weather Service and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration put us all at risk by reducing our access to information. Plus, this is all very costly, since weather and climate disasters costing over $1 billion in damages have become regular occurrences in the United States.

The conversation shifted to the health risks from extreme weather with WebMD’s chief physician editor, Dr. Neha Pathak, sharing her insights. Dr. Pathak hosts WebMD’s Health Discovered podcast. She explained how the warming climate is increasing a host of health issues including heat illness, mosquito-borne diseases, respiratory and cardiovascular problems, asthma and allergies, just to name a few.

Given the financial and health burdens of the climate crisis, it is deeply disturbing that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) on July 29 published a proposal to repeal the bedrock scientific determination — known as the endangerment finding — that carbon pollution threatens our health and environment. Without it, the federal government loses its legal authority to limit climate-warming gases like CO₂ and methane.

By ignoring science and dismantling the very tools that have kept our air cleaner and our communities safer, we are choosing vulnerability over security. This could mean more lives lost to extreme heat, more homes destroyed by hurricanes and floods, more forests or neighborhoods consumed by wildfires.

This is a direct attack on us and our future. It would make regulating climate pollution nearly impossible at a time when our communities are facing extreme heat, floods and rising utility bills.

Here’s the reality: We already have the knowledge, technology and capacity to protect people, strengthen our economy and lead the world in clean energy. Abandoning these tools is not just short-sighted, it’s dangerous.

Congress must act now to defend the endangerment finding, uphold the EPA’s mission and keep America safe, competitive and on the path to true energy independence. Our lives, our livelihoods and our place in the world depend on it.

The Public Service Commission approved the proposal with a 4-1 vote, allowing Entergy to move forward with construction of three natural gas-fired power plants to supply the massive facility. The decision was fast-tracked from its originally scheduled October date, reflecting the political and economic weight the project carries for the state.

The data center, located on a 2,250-acre state-owned site, will require approximately 2,500 megawatts of electricity—nearly three times the annual usage of New Orleans. This energy demand will increase Entergy’s electricity needs in the state by around 30%. Entergy plans to build two power plants near the data center in Richland Parish and a third in St. Charles Parish. The company argues that this approach ensures grid stability and avoids overloading the existing infrastructure, a common issue in other states where data centers simply add load to the grid without additional generation.

The project has drawn sharp debate over cost distribution and environmental impact. Critics, including the Louisiana Energy Users Group and the Alliance for Affordable Energy, have raised concerns that ratepayers may eventually shoulder some of the project’s costs. The new power plants are expected to cost around $5 billion, with Entergy also investing in a $550 million transmission line to support the facility. Opponents argue that the long lifespan of gas-fired plants—up to 40 years—poses a financial risk if Meta were to leave after its 15-year energy contract ends, potentially leaving ratepayers to cover operational costs.

Supporters, however, emphasize the economic benefits for a region that has long struggled with high poverty and unemployment rates. The project is projected to create 6,500 construction jobs and up to 500 permanent jobs once operational. Local officials, including Gov. Jeff Landry and regional economic development leaders, have welcomed the investment as a transformative opportunity for the area. Rob Cleveland of the economic development authority in northeast Louisiana described the impact as ""exponential growth"" for small businesses, already evident from early construction activity.

Meta has committed to developing 1,500 megawatts of renewable energy in partnership with Entergy, though this provision is not legally binding. The company’s representative, Ashley Settle, stated that the location was chosen for its infrastructure, workforce, and grid reliability. Entergy’s CEO, Phillip May, added that the project will reinforce the state’s energy grid, create economic opportunities, and support a more sustainable energy future.

The approval process has been marked by secrecy and allegations of backdoor deals. Some key details, including energy load estimates and cost projections, were filed under seal by the administrative law judge handling the case. While Entergy insists these are commercially sensitive, opponents argue that the lack of transparency undermines public accountability. The Alliance for Affordable Energy has called for a delay in the vote, warning of potential grid reliability issues and environmental risks tied to the gas-powered plants.

Ultimately, the decision reflects a broader national trend of energy-intensive data center projects being supported by state governments in exchange for economic development promises. Louisiana’s approval sets a precedent for how large-scale AI infrastructure is being funded and regulated, with implications for future projects in the U.S.

Designing Lunar Nuclear Reactors What are the considerations for designing a nuclear reactor for the moon?
Risks of Lunar Reactor Launch What are the risks if something goes wrong with the launch?
What happens if an asteroid hits the moon or directly hits the lunar nuclear reactor?","China, Russia, and the United States are racing to put nuclear power plants on the moon. China and Russia in May agreed to work together to complete a lunar nuclear reactor by 2036. In response, NASA’s interim chief Sean Duffy announced in August that the United States would fast track its lunar nuclear power program to have one ready by 2030.

But this sudden frenzy raises a few questions—such as why do we want nuclear reactors on the moon in the first place? And how would they work? To find out, IEEE Spectrum spoke with Katy Huff, a nuclear engineer and the director of the Advanced Reactor Fuel Cycles Laboratory at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Huff previously served as the assistant secretary for nuclear energy at the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE).

Why do the world’s biggest space organizations want nuclear reactors on the moon, and what would they power?

Katy Huff: There’s a growing interest in having a more sustained presence of humans on the moon for scientific discovery. Resources like helium-3, which can serve as a fusion fuel, may be part of the appeal. NASA is planning to build this kind of lunar exploration base through its Artemis program, and China and Russia are working together to build one called the International Lunar Research Station. Any such lunar base would absolutely need nuclear power. Renewables alone are too intermittent to meet the energy needs of life on the moon. Plus, the cost of getting things into space scales by mass, so the unmatched energy density of uranium fission is our greatest opportunity.

Why is it suddenly a race? What’s the urgency?

Huff: The momentum began with the fission surface power project at NASA, which a few years ago solicited designs for 40-kilowatt lunar microreactors. Three designs were selected and awarded US $5 million each. Since then, China and Russia have announced on at least three occasions a joint effort to design their own lunar microreactor with a launch target in the mid-2030s. In response, NASA is accelerating its timeline for the U.S. reactor to 2030 and increasing the target power capacity to 100 kW. Sean Duffy has said publicly that if China and Russia are the first to stake a claim for a lunar power plant, they could declare a de facto keep-out zone, limiting the United States’ options to site its base. So the U.S. aims to get there before China and Russia to claim a region with access to water ice, which aids life support for astronauts.

Designing Lunar Nuclear Reactors

What are the considerations for designing a nuclear reactor for the moon?

Huff: In very low gravity, fluids won’t behave exactly as they do on Earth. So the circulation patterns for the reactor’s fluid coolants will need to be recalculated. And the moon’s large temperature swings, which vary hundreds of degrees from lunar day to night, will require the reactor to use systems that are more isolated from those swings. On Earth we eject waste heat easily because there are thermally stable heat sinks like water bodies available.

What kind of reactor do you expect NASA to choose?

Katy Huff previously served as the assistant secretary for nuclear energy at the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE).Katy Huff

Huff: It would make sense if NASA chose one of the three designs previously selected for the fission surface power program, rather than starting from scratch. But with the over-doubling of target capacity, from 40 kW to 100 kW, there will be a bit of a redesign involved, because you don’t just turn up the knob. The three awards went to Lockheed Martin/BWXT, Westinghouse/Aerojet Rocketdyne, and X-energy/Boeing. Some of them are developing microreactors that are based around tristructural isotropic [TRISO] fuel, which is a type of highly robust uranium fuel, so I would expect the lunar reactor to be designed using that. For the coolant, I don’t expect them to choose water, because water’s thermal properties limit the range of temperatures it can cool effectively, which constrains reactor efficiency. And I don’t expect it to be liquid salt either, because it can be corrosive, and this lunar reactor needs to operate for 10 years with no intervention. So I suspect they’ll choose a gas such as helium. And then for power conversion, NASA’s directive explicitly said that a closed Brayton cycle would be a requirement.

What would transport and startup look like?

Huff: The reactor would be fully constructed on Earth and ready to go, with the fuel in place. My expectation is that it would be transported with the control elements fully inserted into the reactor to prevent a chain reaction from starting during transit. Once on the moon, a startup sequence would be initiated remotely or by the astronauts there. The control rods would then withdraw from the reactor, and a small neutron source like californium-252 would kick off the reaction.

A deadline of 2030 feels pretty rushed considering the United States doesn’t have a final design for the reactor, nor firm plans for a lunar base.

Huff: Right. That timeline does appear ambitious. We’ll have a hard enough time getting a reactor of this scale deployed as a prototype terrestrially in the next four and a half years. Getting one launch-ready and onto the moon by then is a recipe for eventually having to explain why we didn’t meet that timeline. And that could be a problem, reputationally, for nuclear energy more so than space exploration because people love NASA. Little kids and grown-ups alike wear NASA T-shirts. No one’s wearing DOE T-shirts.

Risks of Lunar Reactor Launch

What are the risks if something goes wrong with the launch?

Huff: Beautifully enough, fresh uranium fuel doesn’t present a radiological hazard the way spent uranium would. Only after it becomes the fission products is it significantly radioactive. So as long as the reactor doesn’t operate before launch, the hazard is quite low. Even if the fuel were dispersed over the Earth, it wouldn’t pose a significant danger to the people around it. I literally have a sample of uranium sitting by my desk. On top of that, there’s a robust launch safety protocol already established for any radiological object. NASA has a lot of experience with this from sending plutonium thermoelectric generators, which are more like a nuclear battery, for previous missions.

Things have gone wrong with some of the fission reactors previously launched into space; what happened to those?

Huff: The biggest fission reactors anyone has launched into space were the 5 kW electric TOPAZ-I reactors that were part of the Soviet program. One of them had a serious incident and broke apart. It’s now in high orbit in pieces, including some of its sodium coolant, which is just sort of floating around up there as liquid metal spheres. But that doesn’t impact the Earth because it’s a tiny amount of radiological source material at an incredible distance from Earth. The more unfortunate incident happened with the Soviet Kosmos 954 reactor, which, after operating in orbit, experienced uncontrolled reentry and disintegrated over a 600-kilometer swath of Canadian territory.

“What I meant by that is that we've made these (vehicles) political.” Strategic Vision’s research reflects that political divide.","GREER — When BMW Manufacturing decided to invest $1.7 billion to build electric vehicles in the Upstate, with plans to produce at least six fully electric BMW X models by 2030, it was a decision the company did not make lightly since BMW knows customers, especially Americans, like to have choices.

It’s a risk they’re betting will pay off. So are other automakers like Tesla, Mercedes-Benz and Ford, which just unveiled plans for a midsize EV truck.

But the latest politics around electric vehicles have called into question the future of an industry that was just starting to take off.

This year, the Trump administration eliminated the $7,500 tax credit for new electric vehicles, which ends Sept. 30.

A 25 percent tariff on imported automobiles and auto parts has strained most companies’ margins — although BMW has maintained an optimistic outlook, thanks to its production strategy in Spartanburg and aggressive product rollout.

Then there’s the political turmoil around EVs and the man who made them famous. Tesla CEO Elon Musk managed to ostracize both progressive and conservative consumers this year by aligning with — then maligning — President Donald Trump.

His public commentary and work with the DOGE commission, which slashed government spending, inspired an arsonist to toss a Molotov cocktail on a Cybertruck in Manhattan and some Tesla owners to don bumper stickers that said, ""I Bought This Before We Knew Elon Was Crazy.""

Fewer people now are likely to purchase a Tesla, according to a new survey by market intelligence firm Caliber, which attributed that drop partly to Musk's polarizing persona.

Even with those setbacks, experts say EV demand isn’t going anywhere and that the market will slowly and steadily grow.

It just depends on where you look.

“While consumer demand for EVs and plug-in hybrids has been limited compared to what we've seen elsewhere globally, it's still ticking up,” said Joey Von Nessen, a research economist at the University of South Carolina. ""Ultimately, it will come down to those price and convenience considerations,” he added.

BMW says tariff concerns are overblown

Thanks in large part to the flexibility of its global production network, BMW can meet demand for electric vehicles at any level, spokesperson Steve Wilson said in an email.

Most vehicles the German automaker ships across the world are made in Spartanburg County.

“In the meantime, we continue to follow our strategy of ‘technology openness’ where we offer our customers the freedom to choose a vehicle with the drivetrain that best suits their needs — fully electric, plug-in hybrid, or highly efficient combustion engine,” he added. “BMW has invested proactively in electrification, digitalization, our production network, and our products.”

Despite the squeeze from U.S. and EU tariffs, BMW is holding firm on its full-year financial outlook. CEO Oliver Zipse said tariff concerns were ""exaggerated"" in a recent company report.

Outside of China, BMW deliveries rose across all sales regions in the first half of the year, with the brand recording nearly 5 percent growth, according to the latest earnings reports. The company also reported “significant” growth in EV sales in the first half of 2025, nearly 19 percent.

One thing is clear: Electric vehicles are going to be a noticeable component of the automotive industry in the long run, which is good for companies like BMW, Von Nessen said.

There’s been steady growth in EV sales over the previous decade and overall growth in demand globally. That's been especially true in recent years as the cost of materials — including batteries — has declined, vehicle production has increased and infrastructure to support EVs has improved.

In China, for example, about half of all new vehicles that are sold are either EVs or plug-in hybrids compared to only about 10 percent in the U.S.

“It's not just about looking at what's happening in the U.S. in terms of changes in demand, but also what we're seeing on a global scale because South Carolina manufacturers are serving a global market,” Von Nessen said.

South Carolinians still slow to adopt EVs

The U.S. has been slower than some to embrace electric vehicles.

From 2019 to 2025, polling shows 51 percent of all new vehicle buyers in the U.S. reported no interest in an EV, while 28 were open to learning about it. Some 18 percent planned to research it in the future and 3 percent were actively looking for an electric vehicle as their next purchase.

The gap widens when you factor in political affiliation: only 30 percent of Democrats rejected an EV, while most Republicans did at 70 percent, according to research from Strategic Vision, a consulting firm that studies the psychology behind the car choices of about a quarter-million Americans a year.

“In 2019, I started sharing that whenever a political leader or policymaker talked about an EV or EV sale, a future EV intender died,” said Alexander Edwards, president of Strategic Vision. “What I meant by that is that we've made these (vehicles) political.”

Strategic Vision’s research reflects that political divide. U.S. car shoppers who are Democrats are more likely to prioritize environmental friendliness, gas or electric efficiency and vehicle safety features. Republicans want a vehicle with the best image, power and pickup.

In South Carolina, the numbers are similar, but with a little more initial rejection. Fifty-eight percent of car shoppers rejected EVs altogether from 2019 to 2025, while 26 percent were open to learning about them, according to Strategic Vision’s research. Fourteen percent planned to research it for their next purchase, while just 2 percent were actively shopping for a vehicle that has EV technology.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/1/45/145eb882-a6bf-4886-80eb-3854243d6fb1/63506ac44cd15.image.jpg?crop=1519%2C798%2C0%2C136&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2025-08-24 06:01:02.804665

ČEZ has selected Amentum to support its new nuclear program by advancing plans for two small modular reactors (SMRs).","For decades, Russian-designed reactors have dominated the CEE nuclear landscape, holdovers of the Soviet era. However, the war in Ukraine has begun to challenge this status quo, and the tide may now turn, allowing US companies to assume a more dominant role in the region’s nuclear power sector in the long term.

As the European Union has turned decisively to the United States to diversify its gas supplies, it could do the same in the field of nuclear energy. This is also supported by the recent trade agreement, according to which the EU intends to procure US liquefied natural gas, oil, and also nuclear energy products, with an expected offtake valued at 750 billion dollars (about 700 billion euros) over the next three years.

In most countries of the CEE region, nuclear facilities are equipped with Russian-designed VVER reactors: Hungary’s Paks plant, Slovakia’s Jaslovské Bohunice and Mochovce, Czechia’s Dukovany and Temelín, Bulgaria’s Kozloduy, and Ukraine’s four nuclear power plants, Zaporizhzhia, Rivne, Khmelnytskyi and South Ukraine. Romania’s Cernavodă plant is based on Canadian CANDU technology, while the joint Krško plant of Slovenia and Croatia is the work of the US-based Westinghouse.

VVER reactors were supplied with fuel by Rosatom’s fuel manufacturing company, TVEL. However, after 2022, Slovakia, Czechia, Bulgaria and Ukraine began diversifying their fuel suppliers, with Westinghouse taking a leading position in this process.

Westinghouse fuels the region

In 2023, the company signed a long-term agreement with Slovenské elektrárne to license and supply VVER-440 fuel assemblies to its Nuclear Power Plants in Slovakia. It recently delivered the first batches of fuel to ČEZ for the Temelín and Dukovany plants, and is also supplying Energoatom for all of its nuclear reactors in Ukraine. It has a 10-year contract in Bulgaria, where they also delivered the first batch of VVER-1000 fuel for the Kozloduy nuclear power plant.

Westinghouse is also leading the Accelerated Program for Implementation of Secure VVER fuel Supply (APIS), a project funded by the European Union’s Euratom Work Programme 2023–2025. The APIS project aims to ensure a reliable supply of nuclear fuel for Russian pressurised water reactors (VVER) operating in the EU and Ukraine. The APIS 1 consortium consists of partners from twelve organisations in eight European countries, including MVM, the owner of the Paks plant.

The company could also build several nuclear plants in the region, potentially expanding Jaslovské Bohunice, Kozloduy, and Khmelnytskyi, and constructing Poland’s first nuclear power plant.

In Romania, American companies are participating in the expansion of Cernavodă, and the deployment of small modular reactors (SMRs) is also planned in the country, using NuScale Power technology.

Hungary opens the door to the US

Hungary has so far not joined this trend, and the EU has not prohibited imports of Russian nuclear fuel either, under the regulations restricting Russian energy imports, which currently apply to gas and oil.

At the same time, the country is not closing the door on American offers concerning small modular reactors (SMRs). These facilities may become increasingly important, as the expansion of the Paks plant is progressing slowly and facing delays, while the country aims to increase its energy production.

Paks II is now expected to be completed in 2032, two years later than previously planned. Additionally, Hungary plans to extend the operation period of the existing plant by 20 years, from 2023 and 2037.

This spring, Hungarian Foreign Minister Péter Szijjártó and US State Secretary Marco Rubio discussed the possibilities for developing Hungarian-US energy cooperation, with special focus on nuclear energy. Hungarian Foreign Minister Péter Szijjártó highlighted Westinghouse’s role in advancing small modular reactors (SMRs).

At the same time, Hungary signed an agreement with British Rolls-Royce SMR, which will provide small modular reactor technology capable of delivering up to 3 gigawatts (GW) of energy to ČEZ.

The latest development is that Hunatom, a member of the Paks II group of companies involved in nuclear technology development, has signed a letter of intent with Synthos Green Energy to use GE Vernova-Hitachi’s high-performance BWRX-300. As the minister Szijjártó noted, “The task is to ensure that, even under these circumstances, we can meet as much of the country’s energy needs as possible ourselves.” Meanwhile, GE Vernova is also expanding in Slovakia.

There are also other nuclear projects underway with the involvement of US companies. ČEZ has selected Amentum to support its new nuclear program by advancing plans for two small modular reactors (SMRs). Slovakia, together with the Czech Republic and Poland, will receive two million US dollars from the US-backed Phoenix project to finance a feasibility study of small modular reactors.

With this momentum, the US is making significant progress toward securing a larger long-term role in the region’s energy sector.",https://ceenergynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/nuclear-power-plant-4535761_1920.jpg,N,,2025-08-24 08:00:22.621548

The scooter sports three ride modes, keyless ignition, storage space, and other nifty features.
Data from the International Energy Agency, the U.S. Energy Information Administration, and oil giant British Petroleum showed that over 16.5 billion tons of oil, coal, and gas are mined every year for traditional gas-guzzling machines.
Using solar panels to charge an EV battery would also bring the price of charging a car down to at or near $0.
Another echoed, ""Come on Honda, bring us the electric Super Cub to the good 'ol USA and Canada!""","Honda's sleek new electric scooter, the CUV e:, is hitting markets with style.

Its six-kilowatt motor means it can hit speeds of up to 52 miles per hour, a zippy pace for the local urban and suburban roads it's meant for, according to Electrek. The scooter sports three ride modes, keyless ignition, storage space, and other nifty features.

""It's not flashy, but it's functional, well-designed, and undeniably useful,"" wrote Electrek.

One of its most innovative and attractive qualities is the swappable battery pack, allowing riders to keep one on the scooter while the other is charging, meaning you're never stuck waiting for a charge.

Honda's website states that the Mobile Power Pack (MPP) could even be shared universally via ""swapping stations on street-corner locations"" and that ""Honda developed the MPP while envisioning a future where people will enjoy their daily lives with clean and safe energy in abundant supply.""

While some might find fault with the EV industry for the pollution it admittedly causes during the production of its parts and especially its batteries — which require mining of rare-earth metals — EVs ultimately create much less damage to the environment than a traditional gas vehicle.

Data from the International Energy Agency, the U.S. Energy Information Administration, and oil giant British Petroleum showed that over 16.5 billion tons of oil, coal, and gas are mined every year for traditional gas-guzzling machines.

Another study from MIT showed that over a car's lifetime, a gas-powered one releases 350 grams of carbon pollution as opposed to an EV's 200, and if that EV were charged with solar panels, it would be at or near zero.

Using solar panels to charge an EV battery would also bring the price of charging a car down to at or near $0. A company like EnergySage makes installation easy by vetting local companies and saving people up to $10,000.

The CUV e: will start selling in Europe and possibly then the U.S., which would be welcome news to some Americans looking to switch to EVs.

""This is a scooter I would buy if it was available in the U.S. Exactly what I have been waiting for in terms of a quality manufacturer with local repair shops and enough speed to keep up with city traffic,"" said one commenter on Electrek.

It was too expensive to be the mass market truck that would tip American drivers away from gasoline and toward batteries.
Its bet on a $30,000 truck is an inversion of the start-expensive-then-go-cheap strategy, and the company argues it’s a return to form.
“Is this something that can change the profitability for electric vehicles, where they have obviously come up well short of what their earlier plans were?
“Is this going to invert the company, moving away from these very profitable vehicles and being mostly a provider of $30,000 vehicles?","President Donald Trump has made no secret of his disdain for electric vehicles and is slamming the brakes on government incentives to get them into more driveways.

He’s been working to undo policies that promote clean technologies while increasing support for coal, oil, and natural gas. In particular, Trump has been working to reverse or halt programs under the Inflation Reduction Act, the single largest US government investment to deal with climate change, signed into law by his predecessor, Joe Biden.

Under Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill, the $7,500 federal tax credit for buying a new electric car, along with a $4,000 credit for used EVs and $40,000 for commercial EVs, is set to expire on September 30.

Those moves may have contributed to Trump’s messy split with Elon Musk, CEO of electric carmaker Tesla and former head of the Department of Government Efficiency.

“Elon was ‘wearing thin,’ I asked him to leave, I took away his EV Mandate that forced everyone to buy Electric Cars that nobody else wanted (that he knew for months I was going to do!), and he just went CRAZY!” Trump posted on Truth Social in June.

More than 90 percent of new cars sold in the US are still gasoline-powered, and EV sales have recently seen a slowdown in the US following a years-long growth spurt. The looming rollback of federal incentives, along with inflation concerns, rising manufacturing costs from tariffs, and increasing competition over raw materials, have led carmakers to cut back on many of the enticements that have made electric cars a better buy.

Many car dealers have also been struggling to move EVs off their lots as customers remain worried about charging infrastructure and cost.

But despite all of these challenges, the popularity of EVs in the US is still growing, and some US automakers remain committed to running on electrons. And in other countries, EVs are racing ahead. More than half of new cars sold in China are electric or hybrids, backed by generous government subsidies. People clearly are willing to drive EVs — at the right price.

Last week, Ford announced that it was pouring $5 billion into building a new EV platform — a chassis and drivetrain for a suite of electric vehicles — in Louisville, Kentucky. The first vehicle rolling off the line will be a four-door pickup truck priced around $30,000. That would put it in line with some of the cheapest pickup trucks on the market today, electric or gasoline. And Ford aims to start deliveries in 2027, less than two years from now.

It’s an ambitious, risky bet in a volatile economy, but it’s a sign that, while electric vehicles may be slowing down in the US, automakers think they aren’t stopping and could accelerate again. It’s also good news for anyone concerned about rising greenhouse gas emissions, since transportation is one of the largest emitters of carbon dioxide in the world.

This isn’t Ford’s first run at an electric pickup truck. In 2021, Ford debuted the F-150 Lightning, the fully electric version of its iconic Ford F-150, the best-selling pickup truck in the US for almost five decades. At times, Ford was selling 100 conventional F-150s per hour.

So, it made a lot of sense that Ford would want to build on that successful platform to go electric. And at first, it seemed like their bet was paying off. Interest was high, and its initial production run for the 2022 model year sold out. The F-150 Lightning was named the 2023 MotorTrend Truck of the Year. Rivals at General Motors and Stellantis (the parent company of Dodge, Jeep, and Chrysler) responded by developing their own electric pickups. But Ford ran into issues with its battery suppliers while the auto industry as a whole hit supply chain snags during the Covid-19 pandemic. Lightning sales quickly hit a pothole, and Ford even paused production for a few months last year.

At the time, I argued that the Ford F-150 Lightning was not the EV America was waiting for. It was too expensive to be the mass market truck that would tip American drivers away from gasoline and toward batteries. The base model Lightning launched at close to $40,000, and the current base model is almost $50,000.

The Lightning was another entry in the US auto industry’s general trend of moving upmarket with bigger, pricier, and more profitable vehicles. Carveouts in fuel economy rules for trucks and SUVs have also contributed to vehicle bloat in recent decades.

The average new car price in the US has reached a record high of almost $50,000 in a country where the median household income is around $80,000. Even pickup trucks, which evoke a burly, working-class aesthetic, are often kitted out and priced like luxury cars. That means a lot of Americans are borrowing to buy them. The average new car payment is $745, and auto loans are the second-largest category of household debt.

Electrification adds another cost. Though electricity is cheaper than gasoline, the average EV has a higher sticker price than its gasoline counterpart. For some automakers, like Tesla and Rivian, this is part of their strategy. First, start by building a high-end vehicle, creating the supply chains and charging network to support it. Then, after achieving economies of scale, start building cheaper vehicles. But so far, carmakers have continued to make more expensive models and have been slow to release cheaper EVs.

Public EV chargers are also nowhere near as ubiquitous as gas stations, and the ones available haven’t always been reliable. The Trump administration halted $5 billion in funding for more EV chargers, but after a court injunction, it began to release the cash.

“The top barrier for [EV] adoption is price, and then infrastructure,” said Stephanie Valdez Streaty, director of industry insights at Cox Automotive.

So, now, Ford is following a different route.

The US may try to reverse the EV transition, but the rest of the world is shifting into overdrive.

Its bet on a $30,000 truck is an inversion of the start-expensive-then-go-cheap strategy, and the company argues it’s a return to form. “Nearly 120 years ago, the Ford Model T became the ‘Universal Car.’ Why? It was affordable, adaptable, and serviceable,” wrote Ford CEO Jim Farley recently. “Now, we’re ushering in the next chapter with the Ford Universal EV Platform.”

Alan Baum, principal of Baum and Associates, a market research firm focused on the auto industry, noted that this isn’t necessarily a shift for the company, but rather, a foray into the global market and an often overlooked swath of potential buyers at home that US automakers have largely ceded to foreign brands.

The customers looking to buy a cheap truck aren’t cross-shopping for a fully tricked-out F-150. And the growing cult of the Kei truck, a variety of tiny, cheap, lightweight gray-market Japanese imports, is an indication that there’s an unfed appetite for small utility vehicles in the US.

“Is this something that can change the profitability for electric vehicles, where they have obviously come up well short of what their earlier plans were? Yes,” Baum said. “Is this going to invert the company, moving away from these very profitable vehicles and being mostly a provider of $30,000 vehicles? Absolutely not.”

The other factor to consider is that, while the US is the land of big trucks, it isn’t the only place where people are buying them.

In the rest of the world, small, cheap cars are still in high demand. Some of the biggest growth markets are in places like southeast Asia, places with high gas prices, narrow roads, and a burgeoning middle class eager to get around. Inside the US, the government has used tariffs to keep Chinese electric carmakers like BYD off the interstate, but they’ve since become dominant in other countries. BYD is now the largest EV manufacturer in the world, while global EV sales are set to break new records this year and US carmakers are still trying to get out of the pit lane.

Meanwhile, massive markets like the European Union are still maintaining their environmental regulations, including a ban on the sales of new gasoline and diesel-powered vehicles by 2035.

So even with rollbacks of EV incentives and reversing regulations that promote cleaner vehicles in the US, carmakers are still facing a lot of pressure to make cleaner vehicles if they want to be competitive in the global market. And companies like Ford want to be competitive in the global market. The US may try to reverse the EV transition, but the rest of the world is shifting into overdrive.

They’re also facing the added constraint of tariffs on materials like steel, aluminum, and rare earth metals. Ford said its new EV platform is aimed at exports as well as the domestic market and that critical components like batteries will be manufactured within the US without using critical minerals like nickel and cobalt.

The energy sector offers a useful parallel. Wind and solar power are now the main ways the world is adding more electricity to the power grid — not because of environmental regulations, but because it’s cheap and quick to get them up and running.

A lower price point is a stronger argument than any climate change bona fides. The words “environment,” “climate,” “carbon,” and “emissions” were conspicuously absent in Ford’s universal EV platform announcement. While the transition to cleaner vehicles is slowing, once EVs are cheaper and better than internal combustion cars, they will race ahead and take a commanding lead.

“The rest of the world’s going electric,” Valdez Streaty said. “I think we’ll continue to see that technology advancement, but definitely we have a lot of hurdles and bumps in the road right now.”",https://static.bundle.app/news/pc-c3a8af0faafcdf8a62d4f045eb406d1e.jpg,N,,2025-08-24 18:01:17.146585

By that measure, China applied for more than twice as many high-quality clean energy patents as the United States in 2022, the most recent year of complete data.
At the time, the stated goal was that Chinese companies would control 80 per cent of the domestic markets of those industries by 2025.
Through patented breakthroughs, the Chinese companies made their batteries lighter, longer-lasting, faster to charge and cheaper to produce.
Ms Biqing Yang, an analyst at Ember, a global energy research organisation, created her own analysis of the European Patent Office’s data.","In 2000, Chinese applicants filed 18 clean energy patents that analysts said were internationally competitive.

In 2022, Chinese applicants filed more than 5,000.

Over two decades, China has leapt ahead of other countries, churning out innovative designs for the energy mix of the future: solar and wind power, batteries and electric cars.

Accused for years of copying the technologies of other countries, China now dominates the renewable energy landscape not just in terms of patent filings and research papers, but also in what analysts say are major contributions that will help to move the world away from fossil fuels.

“It may sound simplistic, but the ultimate indicator of patent quality is how much money a company or institution has spent on protecting its application, including by filing it in many countries,” said Mr Yann Meniere, chief economist at the European Patent Office, which shared the most robust data available on trends in competitive patent filings with The New York Times. “Purely based on that, we can see how China has gone from being an imitator to an innovator.”

The European Patent Office data considers any application that has been filed in two or more countries to be of high quality, based on the assumption that companies went through the trouble and expense of applying for a patent in more than one market with the intention of protecting their invention across borders. Patents prevent others from making, using or selling the innovation without permission for a specified period.

By that measure,

China applied for more than twice as many high-quality clean energy patents

as the United States in 2022, the most recent year of complete data. And while Chinese applicants continue to file a large number of lower-quality patents that may be duplicative or insignificantly different from existing inventions, a growing proportion is of higher quality.

That trend has been driven by strategic policies from Beijing as well as a maturing of China’s academic research environment.

“It is the opposite of an accident,” said Dr Jenny Wong Leung, an analyst and data scientist at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, which created a database of global research on technologies that are critical to nations’ economic and military security, including clean energy.

Last summer, leaders of the Chinese Communist Party who gathered to plan the country’s future paid more attention to scientific training and education than any other policy, except for measures to strengthen the party itself.

In mid-2015, the Chinese government announced a programme called “Made in China 2025”. It would provide companies in 10 strategic industries with large, low-interest loans from state-owned investment funds and development banks, assistance in acquiring foreign competitors and generous subsidies for scientific research. At the time, the stated goal was that Chinese companies would control 80 per cent of the domestic markets of those industries by 2025.

That effort has largely succeeded, Dr Wong Leung and other analysts said.

Chinese clean-tech companies have come to dominate both domestic and international markets. While Western countries like the US and Australia pioneered now-widespread technologies like solar panels, batteries and supercapacitors (which are like batteries, only smaller, and provide quick bursts of energy), China is now building on those designs and creating new, groundbreaking versions.

“The sheer volume of Chinese investment has been so much larger than in the West,” Dr Wong Leung said. “It meant they could build industries from the ground up, all the way through the supply chain.”

But it has not just been about money, analysts said. The Chinese government has encouraged cut-throat domestic competition that some economists have likened to “economic Darwinism”.

Mr Sam Adham, head of battery materials at CRU Group, a market analysis company, described a typical scenario: First comes a flood of subsidies into a particular industry that the government has deemed strategic. Companies pile in, filing dozens or even hundreds of patents along the way. In the final stage, Mr Adham said, the government pulls the subsidies and the less competitive companies essentially are “culled”, while “the remaining companies emerge stronger and they go overseas and take market share there”.

Take, for instance, batteries for electric vehicles. While the original breakthroughs in producing lithium-ion batteries were made in the US three decades ago, further research received little government backing there. Meanwhile, Chinese companies grabbed the baton.

BYD, based in Shenzhen, recently surpassed Tesla as the world’s largest manufacturer of electric cars, and CATL, a Chinese rival based in Ningde, produces the most batteries. BYD and CATL have both relied on lithium-ion batteries that use relatively inexpensive iron and phosphate, combined with lithium, rather than nickel and cobalt, which Western producers have favoured. Through patented breakthroughs, the Chinese companies made their batteries lighter, longer-lasting, faster to charge and cheaper to produce.

Those improvements are making electric cars safer and more convenient to drive, too.

A research team at CATL, which supplies batteries to electric automakers like Tesla and BMW, developed a way to minimise fire risk in car batteries that won a European Inventor Award in 2023. The series of patents, with unremarkable-sounding descriptions about battery covers and short circuits, amount to a major step forward in preventing catastrophic heat build-up and explosions when electric vehicles are overcharged.

China has nearly 50 graduate programmes focused on battery chemistry and metallurgy. According to the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, 65.5 per cent of widely cited technical papers on battery technology come from researchers in China, compared with 12 per cent from the US.

With its competitive advantage widening, China has sought to limit “technology leakage”, as some analysts put it. As of July, Beijing has restricted any effort to transfer out of China eight key technologies for manufacturing electric vehicle batteries, be that through trade, investment or technological cooperation.

“China has often done this unofficially in the past,” Mr Adham said, “but now it’s becoming written law.”

That would very likely cement China’s dominant role in producing batteries unless other countries invest similarly in research. Analysts said those moves make the global energy transition, which is central to efforts to limit human-driven climate change, ever more reliant on Chinese technologies.

Ms Biqing Yang, an analyst at Ember, a global energy research organisation, created her own analysis of the European Patent Office’s data. “If you take China out of the data,” she said, “there are even recent years where you will find that global innovation has stagnated or even slowed down.”

And she said that recent announcements from the Chinese government indicated it was nudging companies to look beyond solar panels and batteries to more nascent technologies.

“Carbon capture, smart grids, the electrification of heavy industry, those are the frontiers,” Ms Yang said. NYTIMES",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/e5de39b771db73895c0045f534993e8e38d4af7a1b1319f1456f753314d145d7,N,,2025-08-24 04:58:01.107908

It said European manufacturers - including car makers in Britain - are set to lose ground on their domestic market by overlooking the affordable EV market.
Yet domestic car makers have pivoted to premium products, 'given the higher profit margins they tend to earn on bigger vehicles,' Gooding said.
The scheme offers taxpayer-funded discounts on some new electric models of up to £3,750 as part of an effort to kickstart sales.
Even the £27,000 electric Mini is set to miss out on Government's supplied discounts via the Electric Car Grant launched last month.","Cheap Chinese cars are set to take over the car market as British and European makers continue to focus resources and output on premium SUVs, a new report has warned.

Chinese makers are already claiming a 10 per cent share of new car sales in the UK - and they are poised to dominate Britain's roads in the coming years, the study said.

Dominance of Chinese brands will be driven by their higher concentration of small, affordable EVs, which European and British car makers are currently overlooking, according to the Global Fuel Economy Initiative (GFEI) and the FIA Foundation, the charity linked to motorsports' biggest governing body.

In itreport, it states: 'China, which now accounts for 27 per cent of global passenger car sales, has secured a competitive edge in manufacturing smaller EVs, with strengths across key aspects of EV production, including battery supply chains, manufacturing efficiency, and software.'

The study went on: 'It means China has evolved from a net importer of passenger cars before 2020 to the world's largest net exporter.'

It said European manufacturers - including car makers in Britain - are set to lose ground on their domestic market by overlooking the affordable EV market.

Instead, UK makers are steering towards premium models, with Jaguar set to release a £100,000-plus EV in the coming months, shortly after its sister brand Land Rover brings to market its first all-electric Range Rover, due to cost around £150,000.

Cheap Chinese cars are set to take over the car market as British and European makers continue to focus resources and output on premium SUVs, a new report has warned

Chinese makers are already claiming a 10 per cent share of new car sales in the UK - and they are poised to dominate Britain's roads in the coming years, the study said

The report says the 'shift in regional power balance' in the automotive market - very much in China's favour - is the result of changing market trends.

'Electric vehicles sold in most markets outside China have predominantly targeted larger vehicle size segments,' the study summarised.

'This shift towards SUVs and adoption of EVs has resulted in increasing average vehicle purchase prices, which has contributed to stagnation in new vehicle sales in high-income markets and an aging of their vehicle fleets.'

The report says European and British manufacturer have reacted to this demand by prioritising larger models, which 'offer automakers higher profit margins' but have a 'detrimental impact on vehicle affordability, negative impacts on road safety, and increase energy and material consumption, threatening environmental targets'.

It instead urged makers to pivot to smaller EVs like those produced by Chinese companies that will 'serve as a strategic response to these challenges'.

Chinese newcomers have already started to flood the market with affordable small models. One of the most impressive is the BYD Dolphin Surf, which starts from less than £17,000. That's around £8,000 less than a Vauxhall Corsa Electric

The Leapmotor T-03 is currently the cheapest EV sold in Britain, starting from £14,495

In contrast to these affordable small EV, JLR is on the cusp of launching its first all-electric Range Rover, which will cost in the region of £150,000

Steve Gooding, chief executive of the RAC Foundation, told The Telegraph that British drivers are already seeing the huge appeal of affordable, small electric models by snapping up those being sold by Chinese newcomer brands.

He highlighted the demise of the Ford Fiesta in 2023 - Britain's all-time best-selling car - as creating a gap in the market for more 'small, keenly priced EVs'.

Yet domestic car makers have pivoted to premium products, 'given the higher profit margins they tend to earn on bigger vehicles,' Gooding said.

It comes as Labour last month launched its new Electric Car Grant (ECG) aimed at increasing demand for more budget-friendly EVs.

The scheme offers taxpayer-funded discounts on some new electric models of up to £3,750 as part of an effort to kickstart sales.

It is tailored towards the less expensive end of the market, available only to sub-£37,000 models, which rules out many of the premium electric cars built in the UK and Europe.

However, it also looks to penalise Chinese brands by including sustainability targets that will rule of many of the new brands arriving in Britain in recent months.

In order to be eligible for the scheme, manufacturers must meet a designated threshold for emissions produced during the battery's manufacturing, the vehicle's assembly, and the 'carbon intensity' of the electric grids in the countries where the car is made.

A two-tier approach will see the greenest-made EVs qualify for the full Band 1 grant of £3,750, while those unable to meet the Government's highest standard will still get a discount of £1,500 at a Band 2 level.

However, many brands will be ruled out entirely.

MPs have stated that China's ongoing reliance on coal-powered energy would ultimately rule them out of the Government-supplied discounts.

Knowing this, many Chinese makers have instead launched their own discount schemes to match the value of that provided by the ECG to remain competitive on price.

UK roads could soon be dominated by Chinese brands will be driven by their higher concentration of small, affordable EVs, which European and British car makers are currently overlooking, according to the Global Fuel Economy Initiative and the FIA Foundation

As it currently stands, only Nissan is set to deliver smaller UK-made electric cars in the short-term future that will be eligible for the grant, which is running until 2028-29 thanks to a £650million backing.

It's new Leaf EV - set to start from around £30,000 and using batteries supplied by its neighbouring battery gigafactory - has just entered production and will be on sale later this year.

While other Nissan models not produced in Britain have already been confirmed as qualifying for the lower £1,500 Band 2 ECG, the Leaf is expected to be among those eligible for the full amount.

Nissan is also due to unveil a next-generation Juke EV, which will be an even cheaper compact SUV powered by British-supplied batteries. This is also likely to qualify for the full £3,750 saving.

Some 22 EV models (at the time of publishing) have been confirmed as qualifying for a Band 2 £1,500 discount, including the Renault 5 and Volkswagen ID.3.

EV experts have labelled the scheme an 'expensive mess', while retailers have said it has put the handbrake on electric car sales while customers wait to find out which models are eligible for discounts.

Even Mini could be set to miss out on the discounts.

Even the £27,000 electric Mini is set to miss out on Government's supplied discounts via the Electric Car Grant launched last month. This is because the EV version of the British icon is currently being produced in China as part of a deal with Great Wall Motor

Despite producing cars at its Cowley factory in Oxford for two decades, its parent group BMW has outsourced manufacturing of its all-electric Mini hatchback and Aceman crossover to China in a deal with Great Wall Motor (GWM).

Having previously committed to bringing production of electric Minis back to the Oxford plant in 2026, earlier this year BMW bosses announced they had put on hold plans to invest £600million into retooling the UK factory due to a slower than expected take-up of EVs.

They said they had paused its investment given 'multiple uncertainties facing the automotive industry'.

Yet the Mini's £26,905 starting price tag is £10,000 higher than that of rival-sized Chinese EVs, such as BYD's £17k Dolphin Surf.

Leapmotor's T-03, the smallest electric car on sale in Britain today, costs even less, currently starting from £14,495 after the Chinese brand reduced its pricing by £1,500 following the announcement of Labour's ECG.

Jack Cousens, head of roads policy at the AA, said 'budget-friendly' Chinese EVs have already secured East Asian brands a strong grip on the UK market - which they are destined to extend in the run-up to the end of the decade.

Some 19,000 of the 191,000 cars sold in the UK in the month of June were made by Chinese brands, including the likes of BYD, MG, GWM Ora, Jaecoo and Omoda.

And this success has seen Chinese brands extend their attention to larger family models to increase their stronghold on UK and European markets.

Cousens told the Daily Mail: 'MG, now Chinese owned, offers both small and larger EVs.

'Jaecoo, Xpeng and Genesis are doing well in the larger market.

'Look out for the Jaecoo J5 which is on the cusp of being released and looks like a Range Rover Evoque, but at a fraction of the price.'

AA president Edmund King added: 'There is no doubt that over the last twenty years the size of vehicles, whether petrol, diesel or electric, has grown in line with the popularity of SUV models where consumers seem to like the higher seating position and extra space.

'However, well designed smaller EVs, such as the Renault 5 and Mini electric range, have proved popular.

'There are now more than 130 EV models available in the UK, which are a mix of budget cars, family cars and SUVs. There are more than 33 new EVs with a price under £30,000, with more set to launch in the UK in the coming months and with Government grants applicable to this sector, we should see an increase in smaller less expensive EVs.'

The Department for Transport says the ECG aims to encourage uptake of small EVs.

A spokesman said: 'We're investing over £4billion to support both industry and consumers in making the switch to electric, giving drivers the confidence to choose the models that work best for them.

'This includes providing discounts worth up to £3,750 off the cost of a new electric car and rolling out more public chargepoints with 83,000 now available and over 100,000 more on the way.'",https://static.bundle.app/news/pc-be9e215a03e67c9dae414ee2e1956f22.jpg,N,,2025-08-24 12:05:56.024471

He referenced fresh evidence that the local administration had misrepresented its compliance with the Forest Rights Act, 2006.

According to Ramesh, officials have made false claims that ""(i) the rights of local tribal communities under the Forest Rights Act, 2006 have been identified and settled; (ii) the consent of the affected tribal communities themselves has been lawfully obtained.""

Ramesh further wrote, ""It has been abundantly clear for some time that the project is simply being bulldozed through.""

According to a press release from the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change in November 20224, the decision regarding the development of the Great Nicobar Island project has been taken after careful consideration of potential environmental impacts on the island's ecology, as well as the significant strategic, defence, and national importance of the developmental projects.

According to the Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) Notification, 2006, as amended periodically, prior environmental clearance is mandatory for all new projects and activities, or the modernisation of existing ones, listed in the notification's schedule. The process involves an assessment of project impacts and the preparation of an Environmental Management Plan (EMP) through stages such as screening, scoping, public consultation, and appraisal.

The release noted that multiple studies were conducted to assess the environmental impact and propose mitigation measures. These studies were carried out by prominent statutory and non-statutory bodies, including the Zoological Survey of India (ZSI), the Salim Ali Centre for Ornithology and Natural History (SACON), the Wildlife Institute of India (WII), and the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), as part of the EIA/EMP preparation. Specialist organisations such as the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs), the National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT), the National Centre for Coastal Research (NCCR), and the National Institute of Oceanography (NIO) were also involved during the appraisal process.

An independent Expert Appraisal Committee (EAC), comprising experts in science and engineering, conducted a detailed scrutiny of the EIA/EMP report during the project appraisal. The environmental clearance granted includes 42 specific conditions addressing each component of the project to safeguard marine and terrestrial biodiversity.

Three independent monitoring committees have been established to oversee the implementation of the Environmental Management Plan.

The Associated Press

When Terrence Dwyer received a knock on his door and a flyer for a solar panel system small enough to fit on his deck, he was quickly sold. Solar systems that plug into regular wall outlets have been popular in Europe for years and are gaining traction in the U.S. for their affordability and simple installation.

“We thought absolutely, let’s do this right away,” said Dwyer, who lives in Oakland, California.

These small-scale solar systems could become attractive to more homeowners now that President Donald Trump’s sweeping budget-and-policy package will scrap residential rooftop solar tax credits and may shift interest to cheaper alternatives. Even before the GOP bill passed, manufacturers of the smaller systems known as plug-in or balcony solar were seeing increased demand and other positive signs such as a new Utah law streamlining regulations for homeowners to buy and install them. The systems about the size of a door haven’t been as widely adopted in the U.S. as in Europe because of lack of awareness, patchwork utility rules and limited availability.

The $2,000 plug-in solar system installed on Dwyer’s backyard deck in March consists of two 400 watt panels, an inverter, a smart meter and a circuit breaker. It saves him around $35 per month on his power bill because he is consuming less energy from the grid, but he said reducing his carbon footprint was his primary motivation.

“We like the environmental benefits of solar and wanted to engage with solar in some fashion,” Dwyer said.

Had Dwyer opted for rooftop solar, he would have paid $20,000 for the system and $30,000 to upgrade his roof to support the panels.

Installing a plug-in solar system requires some homework. What power companies let customers do with energy-generating equipment varies, which is why prospective purchasers should check their utility’s policies first. Building permits might be required depending on the municipality. Some systems can be self-installed, while others may require an electrician. For example, some kits have meters that must be wired into a home’s circuit breaker.

Removing hurdles for plug-in solar

Dwyer bought his system from Bright Saver, a nonprofit company in California that advocates for plug-in solar. In addition to the type Dwyer bought, the company also offers a smaller model costing $399 that recently sold out in six days.

“The interest and demand have been overwhelming,” said Cora Stryker, a founder of Bright Saver. “It is clear that we are hitting a nerve — many Americans have wanted solar for a long time but have not had an option that is feasible and affordable for them until now.”

Kevin Chou, another founder of Bright Saver, said wider adoption of the systems in the U.S. has been hindered by utility policies that create uncertainty about whether they’re allowed and a lack of state and local policies to make clear what rules apply.

Some utilities contacted by The Associated Press say plug-in solar systems require the same interconnection applications as rooftop panels that send electricity back to the wider network. But Steven Hegedus, an electrical engineering professor at University of Delaware, said he doesn’t understand why a utility would need to require an interconnection agreement for plug-in solar because, unlike rooftop systems, they are designed to prevent energy from flowing to the grid.

Still, if in doubt, a customer should follow their utility’s policy.

During the early days of plug-in solar’s growth, some opposition from utilities is likely since customers are buying less energy, said Robert Cudd, a research analyst at the California Center for Sustainable Communities at the University of California, Los Angeles.

“Utilities really prefer everyone being a predictable and generous consumer of the electricity they sell,” Cudd said.

This year, Utah enacted a novel law supporting plug-in solar by exempting certain small-scale systems from interconnection agreements and establishing safety requirements such as being certified by a nationally recognized testing organization such as Underwriters Laboratories. It appears to be the only state that’s passed legislation supporting plug-in solar, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.

Republican state Rep. Raymond Ward, who sponsored the legislation, said the smaller systems allow people to better manage where their energy comes from and what they pay.

“Europe has these things. You can go buy them and they work and people want them. There is no reason why we shouldn’t have them here in the United States,” Ward said.

Bright Saver says they are lobbying other states for similar legislation.

Alexis Abramson, dean of the University of Columbia Climate School, also applauded Utah’s move.

“We actually need more localities, more states putting in allowances for this type of equipment,” she said.

Plug-in solar availability and savings potential

Some questions remain about how much customers could save. Severin Borenstein, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley’s Haas School of Business, said the cost of some portable solar systems in the U.S. would make it hard for customers to come out ahead on their utility bills over the time they own them. He estimates the price of a $2,000 system in the U.S. works out to paying about $0.20 a kilowatt-hour over a 25-year period, which only saves people money if they have high utility costs. By comparison, Borenstein said the cost of systems sold in Europe, typically around $600, is equivalent to paying about $0.05 or $0.06 per kilowatt-hour over 25 years.

Baltimore resident Craig Keenan said saving money was only part of why he installed one of the smaller Bright Saver models on his balcony in July.

“I’m interested in renewable energy because the amount of carbon emissions that we produce as a species is very, very unsustainable for our world,” he said.

He said he expects the system will save him about $40 per year on utility bills, so it would take him about 10 years to recoup the cost of the kit.

Keenan, a mechanical engineer, said installation took him 10 to 15 minutes.

“I think anyone can install this,” he said. “It’s not complicated. It doesn’t require a technical degree.”

Other companies selling plug-in solar kits include Texas-based Craftstrom. It has sold about 2,000 systems in the U.S. since 2021, mostly in California, Texas and Florida. The company’s basic kits contain a solar panel that can fit in a backyard or other sunny space, along with equipment to maintain and regulate the flow of energy including an inverter and smart meter.

Kenneth Hutchings, Craftstrom’s chief revenue officer, said their U.S. sales rose this year even before the passage of the GOP tax bill, and he expects demand for plug-in solar to increase further as federal rooftop solar credits expire.

The company advises customers to notify their power company before installation, but it has “never had any pushback from any utility,” said Michael Scherer, one of the founders of Craftstrom.

China-based EcoFlow plans to begin selling plug-in solar systems in Utah and expand to other states if supportive legislation is passed, said Ryan Oliver, a company spokesperson.

“This is an example of where technology is sort of ahead of the regulators,” Oliver said, adding: “As this rolls out to more of a nationwide product, we expect it will become more mainstream as people understand it better.”

Originally granted by Congress in 2021, more than $40 million in funding for the charging stations was brought into doubt earlier this year amid changing policies at the federal level.

However, following a court victory in June and overcoming several other administrative hurdles, the funding was restored, according to OPB.

""There was a lot of speculation about what the status was going to be and whether Oregon was going to be able to secure the funds,"" said Brett Howell, transportation electrification coordinator for the Oregon Department of Transportation, per OPB.

""At the end of the day now for us, we do have that funding available to us,"" he continued. ""It is secure. We're going to be moving forward with this.""

Oregon has planned to build roughly 60 public charging stations, with each station including a minimum of four vehicle chargers. The DC chargers would be capable of charging a typical EV to 80% capacity in 20 minutes, according to OPB.

The charging stations were slated to be built along busy traffic corridors, including U.S. Highway 20, U.S. Highway 26, U.S. Highway 101, and Interstate 84, OPB reported.

The program will help bring EV charging stations to Eastern Oregon, which contains much of the state's roadways but has fallen behind in terms of charger access.

Building out vehicle-charging infrastructure is an essential component of transitioning society away from gas-powered cars and toward less-polluting EVs. Greater access to public chargers can give EV drivers more confidence to travel long distances in their vehicles.

Unlike gas-powered cars, electric vehicles do not release heat-trapping pollution or harmful particulate matter, benefitting both public health and the environment.

Plus, driving an EV can save up to $2,200 every year on fuel costs, according to the U.S. Department of Energy.

However, the prevalence and easy access of gas stations in Oregon and across the U.S. remain some of the key advantages that gas-powered vehicles have over EVs.

As of this spring, roughly 88,000 electric vehicles were registered in Oregon, per OPB, but the state had only about 4,000 public and 300 private charging stations to serve all those EVs, per the DOE.

One key advantage that EVs have over gas-powered cars, though, is the ability to charge an EV at home.

To take the cost savings and environmental benefits of EVs even further, you can install solar panels on your home. Solar power can bring your electricity bill down to practically nothing, while also giving you the knowledge that your EV is being powered with cleaner, renewable energy from the sun.

Revolution Wind was expected to be Rhode Island and Connecticut’s first commercial-scale offshore wind farm, capable of powering more than 350,000 homes.
The densely populated states have minimal space available for land-based energy projects, which is why the offshore wind project is considered crucial for the states to meet their climate goals.
Green Oceans, a non-profit that opposes the offshore wind industry, and sued in federal court last year to stop the 83,798-acre (33,912-hectare) Revolution Wind project on environmental grounds, applauded the decision.
This is the second major offshore wind project the Trump White House has halted.","The Democratic governors of Rhode Island and Connecticut promised on Saturday to fight a Trump administration order halting work on a nearly complete wind farm off their coasts that was expected to be operational next year.

The Revolution Wind project was about 80% complete, with 45 of its 65 turbines already installed, according to the Danish wind farm developer Ørsted, when the US Bureau of Ocean Energy Management sent the firm a letter on Friday ordering it to “halt all ongoing activities”.

“In particular, BOEM is seeking to address concerns related to the protection of national security interests in the United States,” wrote Matt Giacona, the agency’s acting director, adding that Ørsted “may not resume activities” until the agency has completed a review of the project.

Giacona said that the project, which had already cleared years of federal and state reviews, now needs to be re-examined in light of Donald Trump’s order, on the first day of his second term, to consider “terminating or amending any existing wind energy leases”.

Giacona, whose prior work as a lobbyist for the offshore oil industry alarmed consumer advocates, also said that the review was necessary to “address concerns related to the protection of national security interests of the United States”. He did not specify what those national security concerns are.

Rhode Island’s governor, Dan McKee, criticized the stop-work order and said he and Connecticut’s governor, Ned Lamont, “will pursue every avenue to reverse the decision to halt work on Revolution Wind”, which was “just steps away from powering more than 350,000 homes”.

Senator Chris Murphy, a Connecticut Democrat, connected the decision to Trump’s reported pitch last year to oil industry executives to trade $1bn in campaign donations for regulatory favors. “When the oil industry showed up at Mar-a-Lago with a set of demands in exchange for a $1 billion of campaign support for Trump, this is what they were asking for: the destruction of clean energy in America,” Murpy said in a statement.

“This is a story of corruption, plain and simple. President Trump has sold our country out to big corporations with the oil and gas industry at the top of the list,” the senator added. “I will work with my colleagues and Governor Lamont to pursue all legal paths to get this project back on track.”

Since returning to office, Trump has taken sweeping actions to prioritize fossil fuels and hinder renewable energy projects. Throughout his time in public office, Trump has repeatedly brought up his visceral hatred for wind power, apparently prompted by his belief that offshore turbines spoil the views at his golf courses, and his embrace of the bizarre theory that “the noise causes cancer”.

Trump recently called wind and solar power “THE SCAM OF THE CENTURY!” in a social media post and vowed not to approve wind or “farmer destroying Solar” projects.

Rhode Island’s attorney general, Peter Neronha, said in a statement on Saturday that, without the Revolution Wind project, the state’s Act on Climate law, which aims to use renewable energy to battle global warming, “is dead in the water”.

Scientists agree that nations need to rapidly embrace renewable energy to stave off the worst effects of climate change, including extreme heat and drought; larger, more intense wildfires and supercharged hurricanes, typhoons and rainstorms that lead to catastrophic flooding.

Construction on Revolution Wind began in 2023, and the project was expected to be fully operational next year. Ørsted says it is evaluating the financial impact of stopping construction and considering legal proceedings.

Revolution Wind is located more than 15 miles (24km) south of the Rhode Island coast, 32 miles (51km) south-east of the Connecticut coast and 12 miles (19km) south-west of Martha’s Vineyard. Rhode Island is already home to one offshore wind farm, the five-turbine Block Island Wind Farm.

Revolution Wind was expected to be Rhode Island and Connecticut’s first commercial-scale offshore wind farm, capable of powering more than 350,000 homes. The densely populated states have minimal space available for land-based energy projects, which is why the offshore wind project is considered crucial for the states to meet their climate goals.

Wind power is the largest source of renewable energy in the US and provides about 10% of the electricity generated in the nation.

Green Oceans, a non-profit that opposes the offshore wind industry, and sued in federal court last year to stop the 83,798-acre (33,912-hectare) Revolution Wind project on environmental grounds, applauded the decision. “We are grateful that the Trump Administration and the federal government are taking meaningful action to preserve the fragile ocean environment off the coasts of Rhode Island and Massachusetts,” the non-profit said in a statement.

This is the second major offshore wind project the Trump White House has halted. Work was previously stopped on Empire Wind, a New York offshore wind project, but construction was allowed to resume after New York’s governor, Kathy Hochul, and senator Chuck Schumer intervened.

“This administration has it exactly backwards. It’s trying to prop up clunky, polluting coal plants while doing all it can to halt the fastest growing energy sources of the future – solar and wind power,” Kit Kennedy, managing director for the power division at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said in a statement. “Unfortunately, every American is paying the price for these misguided decisions.”

As electric cars continue to gain ground all over the world, one of the big questions facing the industry is how to best repurpose the batteries powering those vehicles after they’re retired. It’s a question that doesn’t have a single correct answer, and so a number of startups have emerged in recent years with their own proposals. Some automakers are considering how to tackle this problem, too, and a solution that Toyota has been working on collects all kinds of high-voltage batteries, regardless of chemistry and degradation, and incorporates them all in a factory storage system. In fact, the company has just begun field testing one application at partner Mazda’s Hiroshima plant.

The Sweep Energy Storage System, as it’s named, takes reclaimed batteries from electrified vehicles—whether the cars they powered were pure electric or hybrids—and connects them to the power grid. The energy management logic Toyota has developed monitors and redirects energy flow in fractions of a second to prioritize healthy batteries and bypass underperforming ones.

Horizon, a publication focused on breakthrough science and technology in Asia, adds that the Sweep system also reuses the inverters from electrified cars, which negates the need for additional power conditioners and thus lowers costs.

Mazda’s Hiroshima campus is relatively self-sufficient, as it contains its own thermal and solar power stations. That makes it an ideal location for Toyota to install the Sweep hardware and realize the benefits it poses for Japan’s automakers. Mazda’s on-site power plant “generates a significant portion of the energy required” for the site’s day-to-day operations, according to the manufacturer.

Toyota and Mazda’s systems have been “connected through their respective energy management systems,” per a Toyota press release, and the nature of that relationship is explained in the handy visual aid you see below. “In the future,” the release reads, “the storage system will be used to regulate power supply and demand from renewable energy, which fluctuates depending on weather and time of day, contributing to carbon neutrality.”

Toyota and Japanese energy company JERA launched the first Sweep system in 2022, connecting it to the Chubu Electric Power Grid. According to Interesting Engineering, “the unit achieved a peak output of 485 kW and stored 1,260 kWh, enough to power over 1,200 homes for an hour.” The fact that the system, as designed, can tolerate used batteries of varying quality and chemistries makes it flexible. And flexibility in this case means practicality, which is critical for the uptake of recycling in any form.

The trend has become evident in recent weeks, in which two U.S. battery companies have taken over production sites in South Korea and Europe, betting on being close to customers in markets favoring green technology and renewable energy expansion.

First, it was California-based Lyten, which said in early August it would buy all remaining assets in Sweden and Germany of failed European battery firm Northvolt, which was Europe’s great hope to have a domestic giga-scale battery manufacturer.

But Northvolt in March filed for bankruptcy in Sweden, unable to overcome mounting challenges including “rising capital costs, geopolitical instability, supply chain disruptions, and shifts in market demand.”

A few months later, U.S. battery maker Lyten signed deals to buy Northvolt’s assets in Europe and is considering acquiring a Northvolt Six battery manufacturing facility under construction in Quebec, Canada.

In total, Lyten’s acquisition includes assets valued at approximately $5 billion, including 16 GWh of existing battery manufacturing capacity, more than 15 GWh of capacity under construction, the infrastructure and plans to scale to more than 100 GWh, and the largest and most advanced battery R&D center in Europe, in Sweden’s Västerås.

“The demand for European and North American made batteries is only growing,” Lars Herlitz, Lyten chairman and co-founder, said in a statement.

Lyten, whose investors and partners include FedEx, Stellantis, and Honeywell, currently manufactures lithium-sulfur batteries in Silicon Valley and is selling commercially into the rapidly growing drone and defense markets.

Upon close of Northvolt’s asset acquisition, Lyten plans to immediately restart operations in Skellefteå (Ett) and Västerås (Labs) in Sweden.

At Northvolt Drei in Germany, Lyten is working with Northvolt and the German government to continue the program to establish a battery manufacturing facility near Heide in Schleswig-Holstein, with 15 GWh of initial capacity.

Lyten plans to rehire a large part of the previously laid-off workers, while its collaboration with Northvolt’s prior anchor customers is progressing constructively.

“The acquisition of Northvolt’s assets brings the facilities and Swedish talent to accelerate this mission by years, just at the moment when demand for Lyten lithium-sulfur batteries is growing exponentially to meet energy independence, national security, and AI data center needs,” said Dan Cook, Lyten CEO and co-founder.

Resuming Northvolt’s operations would be a risky undertaking for Lyten, “but considering the current policy and demand climate, it makes sense for a predominantly US-based company to shift toward the European market,” said Connor Watts, battery raw material demand analyst at Fastmarkets.

While Lyten is pursuing large-scale battery manufacturing operations in Europe, another U.S. battery supply chain firm, battery materials manufacturer Group14 Technologies, is looking for growth in Asia, the world’s top battery manufacturing market.

Washington State-based Group14 Technologies this week closed a $463-million funding round led by SK, Inc. In addition, Group14 obtained full ownership of its joint venture with SK Inc located in Sangju, South Korea. Formed in 2021, the joint venture’s battery active materials (BAM) factory produces Group14’s flagship technology, SCC55, at EV scale to support the global battery manufacturing industry.

Group14 Technologies’ existing investors include Porsche Investments, ATL, OMERS, Decarbonization Partners, Lightrock Climate Impact Fund, and Microsoft Climate Innovation Fund.

Group14’s first and second BAM factories are located in Washington State. But the company is also expanding silicon battery infrastructure in Europe with a silane gas factory in Germany, which will supply a critical precursor for next-generation energy storage technologies.

“Strengthening regional supply networks and shifting to next-gen battery chemistries like silicon that reduce material dependency, is more than just risk management,” Group14 chief executive and co-founder, Rick Luebbe, told Techstrong IT earlier this month.

Commenting on the deal in South Korea, Luebbe said in a statement this week,

“We're strengthening regional battery supply chains and safeguarding our customers from global trade uncertainty.”

SCORE: 3.5/5 2025 Cadillac Optiq specifications","With Cadillac offering big price cuts and financing offers on its first Australian offering, the Lyriq EV – which some of us might have pointed out was too damn expensive when it was launched – it looks like the pricing of its entry-level offering, the smaller and undeniably more attractive Cadillac Optiq, is going to be hugely important.

Unfortunately, when EV Central flew to Detroit to drive the new mid-size Optiq on roads filled with slack-jawed yokels and Guns, Trump and God grandmas, the price was still a secret. And it remains so now.

2025 Cadillac Optiq price and equipment

When the Optiq does finally go on sale locally, you can bet Cadillac will be doing its level best to offer it at somewhere under $91,387, because that’s the LCT (Luxury Car Tax) exemption cut off point for EVs, and also about as much as you’d want to pay for one.

This, quite clearly, is the most important car in Cadillac’s three-vehicle range, and the one that has at least some hope of creating volume sales, below the Lyriq, the madly sporty Lyriq V and the large SUV, three-row Vistiq that’s available with only a six-seat layout in Australia, as opposed to seven in the US.

There’s no word on price for Australia yet, but in America you can get into an Optiq from as little as US$54,390, or $84K in our money.

While the Optiq will be the smallest Cadillac, it’s certainly not tiny, measuring 4820mm long, 2126mm wide and sitting on a 2954mm wheelbase. It’s 28mm longer than a Tesla Model Y, for example.

But the real competition it yearns to be compared with are the new BMW iX3 and GLC EV also landing in Australia in 2026. With both German giants throwing massive resource at these vehicles it’s going to be a tough fight for the Optiq.

But at least its size delivers it a solid starting point. It means there’s ample leg room in the rear, with a comfortable bench seat and a flat floor, plus two USB-C outlets and one power outlet. The boot offers a sizable 744 litres of storage, or 1603 litres with the rear seats folded down.

What impressed us most was the level of fit, finish and style up-front, with lots of pleasant materials (despite much of it being recycled materials) and a lovely blue colour scheme in the version tested, which, I should mention, also looks a lot more attractive on the outside then either Lyriq or Vistiq. It might just be the Goldilocks of the range.

As seems compulsory on all modern EVs, there’s a giant touch screen, measuring 33 inches, and it offers cool graphics and the ability to configure things just how you like them.

In terms of tech, US buyers have the option of choosing Super Cruise, which is a seriously capable autonomous driving system that Australians might get to experience a few decades from now.

The Optiq uses an 85kWh Nickel Manganese Cobalt battery that offers range of 486km on the US EPA cycle.

The MY25 versions we drove were dual-motor all-wheel drive cars offering a not overly exciting 224kW and 480Nm. But the word is the MY26 variants, which would logically be the ones we’d get here next year (Cadillac Australia won’t tell us) have had power bumped up to a tastier 328kW and 675Nm.

Down the line, Cadillac should bring the Optiq-V, with a wild 387kW and 880Nm. Because every family SUV needs to be able to rip your arms off.

2025 Cadillac Optiq: What we think

So, what’s the Optiq like to drive and will it be worth the wait when it finally lobs down under in early 2026?

Well we can only base our opinion on the version we drove in the US, which was on the tame side in terms of performance, and that might not be a bad thing.

Compared to the startlingly over-powered Vistiq, the Optiq actually felt like the sort of car you might be interested in if you felt like you should buy an EV, and you wanted a luxury one, but you’re put off, or indeed frightened, by the crazed performance of most electric vehicles.

It’s hard to believe any dual motored EV could feel sane and normal, but in the cases of the Optiq we’re talking about a machine that takes around six seconds to get to 100km/h.

Throw in the fact that it makes familiar sounding, ICE-like noises from its fake-sound generator, and you could actually kid yourself that you’re driving a combustion car.

The Optiq is also comfortable, smooth and pleasant, with a nice ride-handling balance and an air of mid-table luxury – think Lexus rather than Audi, Benz or BMW.

It’s neither exciting, nor threatening, it’s just nice. Capable. Like the kind of Americans you meet in the nicer bits of the south, and less like the ones you meet in Texas.

2025 Cadillac Optiq: Verdict

If Cadillac is ever going to make an impression on Australian buyers, in a market packed with other options and a populace to whom the word “Cadillac” thus far means very little, the Optiq just might be the right-sized, right-priced option that does it.

Joseph Yoon, a consumer insights analyst for Edmunds, anticipates a drop in EV sales after the tax credit expires following some positive momentum in July.","Federal tax credits on both new and used electric vehicles will expire Sept. 30 — about seven years earlier than initially anticipated — after President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act was passed in July.

Under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, buyers of new, qualifying EVs could be eligible for up to $7,500 in federal income tax credits, and preowned EVs that qualify could receive up to $4,000.

The bank or the automaker’s finance company can take a $7,500 tax credit for EV leases but may discount your lease accordingly, according to Edmunds, a car shopping website.

The impending elimination of the tax credit hasn’t exactly sent droves of customers into area dealerships looking to buy an EV.

“We haven’t really seen anybody running in yet, which is surprising because we thought we would,” said Amanda Ryan, a sales consultant for Sylvester Chevrolet in Blakely. “When they first came out with the tax credit, we had a rush of people. I don’t know if it’s just that people aren’t in the market or if people who were going to rush for it already have them. I would say, if anything, maybe next month we’ll get a lot of people coming in for them, but it’s hard to speculate because of how inventory levels, interest rates and all other kinds of stuff play into it as well.”

Charles McFadden, general manager of Audi Wyoming Valley in Plains Twp., recently noticed a small bump in electric vehicle interest at the Luzerne County dealership.

“EV sales have never been all that strong in our area, but there is a slight uptick in anticipation and a lot of incentives from the manufacturer to help beat that deadline,” he said.

McFadden fears sales will plummet once the tax credit expires at the end of next month.

“I believe it will go to just about zero,” he said. “Our manufacturer is taking a very conservative view of the short-term future of EVs.”

McFadden believes several things need to happen for electric vehicle sales to pick up in Northeast Pennsylvania, starting with better incentives.

“Other states give very good rebates for EVs; our state doesn’t give any,” he said. “I just got back from a meeting in Seattle and the Audi dealer that has about 40% EV sales — that’s hugely different than around here.”

He also feels the region needs to add more charging stations to make people more willing to switch from a gas-powered to an electric vehicle.

“We don’t really have much infrastructure,” McFadden said. “If you’re on the West Coast, you can charge your car anywhere.”

McFadden also thinks once the range of travel for electric vehicles increases more customers will consider making a purchase.

“I drive an EV and they’re a really great car,” he said. “They’re quick and they don’t require anywhere near the maintenance of an internal combustion engine. But if the car is only going to go 300 miles on a charge, and you don’t have an easily accessible charge point, you’re not comfortable with it. When you can increase the range of the car and add infrastructure to have very available charge points, that car is going to do very well.”

Sales of electric vehicles have been up and down at Sylvester Chevrolet and more customers have been leasing than buying them, Ryan said.

“Our best seller has been the Equinox because of the affordability of it,” she said. “We definitely sell more internal combustion engines than we do EVs. Usually we average one or two EVs a month, but our area is not as popular with the EVs.”

The elimination of the tax credits likely won’t help matters, Ryan added.

“It’s just a matter of if the manufacturers are going to step up and offer more incentives to kind of make up for the tax incentive going away, but I do believe it’s going to affect sales a little bit,” she said.

Joseph Yoon, a consumer insights analyst for Edmunds, anticipates a drop in EV sales after the tax credit expires following some positive momentum in July.

“I think through the end of the year there will probably be a pretty noticeable decline,” he said. “The $7,500 off a new car is no joke, especially when it comes to leasing, where a lot of these sales are happening. We were talking about this internally (Monday) about what that kind of looks like when it comes to leasing; if you take $7,500 and divide it by 36 months, it’s $208.33 before taxes and before the interest rate is applied to the monthly payment. I think it’s definitely going to change the arithmetic for a lot of buyers who may have been searching for deals.

“The $7,500 off plus whatever dealer incentives and manufacturer incentives there were got me into an EV and I’m sure it was the case for hundreds of thousands of buyers.”

The ending of the tax credits earlier than expected will likely shift the decision-making for automakers, Yoon added.

“I think it’s going to change the way they prioritize how they bring EVs to the market now,” he said. “It’s unfortunate for buyers because, I think, it will mean projects will ultimately be delayed or the selections in the United States may be more limited than they could have been. I think the more agile automakers are going to do their best to adjust pricing and trim levels to keep their sales numbers going to the best of their ability. But I think in the short term there will definitely be declines in sales and market share as both consumers, dealers and the automakers try to navigate this time crunch. Hopefully automakers can make the pricing work. … They have a whole mountain of challenges ahead of them with the tariffs.”

In July, new EV sales rose to 130,082 units, up 26.4% month over month and 19.7% year over year, as the average transaction price dropped to $55,689 — down 2.2% from June and 4.2% from July 2024 — and the price gap with internal combustion engine vehicles narrowed to $7,611, the smallest since December, according to a Cox Automotive report.

It represented the second-highest monthly total on record, with 11 brands posting their best EV sales of the year and the top five automakers by volume — Tesla, Chevrolet, Hyundai, Ford and Honda — all seeing strong gains, per the Cox Automotive report.

“People have been really latching onto these vehicles,” Yoon said. “It’s just hard for us to say what exactly will happen after Sept. 30.”",https://www.thetimes-tribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/STT-L-EVS-0823-01.jpg?w=1024&h=684,N,,2025-08-24 01:59:49.255980

The order to stop work on the Revolution Wind project is the latest move by the Trump administration targeting the country's renewable energy industry.
President Trump, a longtime critic of the wind industry, in January issued a moratorium on new development of offshore wind projects.
""Today, the U.S. has only one fully operational large-scale offshore wind project producing power,"" Milito said.
In April, the Interior Department halted work on an offshore wind project near the coast of Long Island.","The Trump administration has ordered companies to stop construction of a wind farm that's being built off the coast of Rhode Island.

The acting director of the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Matthew Giacona, wrote in a letter to one of the developers, a Danish firm called Ørsted, that the government was halting work on the almost-finished project in order to ""address concerns related to the protection of national security interests of the United States."" The project is also being developed by Global Infrastructure Partners.

The order to stop work on the Revolution Wind project is the latest move by the Trump administration targeting the country's renewable energy industry. President Trump, a longtime critic of the wind industry, in January issued a moratorium on new development of offshore wind projects. The Internal Revenue Service recently put out new guidance that makes it harder for companies building wind and solar projects to qualify for federal tax incentives. And the Commerce Department is investigating whether imports of wind turbines and their components threaten national security.

Ørsted said in a statement that it is ""evaluating all options to resolve the matter expeditiously,"" including legal action.

Revolution Wind is located in federal waters 15 miles south of Rhode Island. Construction started in 2023, and the project has been slated to begin sending power to homes and businesses in Rhode Island and Connecticut starting next year.

""Any pause or uncertainty at this stage could ripple across jobs, contracts, and communities already benefiting from the project,"" Erik Milito, president of the National Ocean Industries Association, a trade group whose members include wind project developers as well as oil and gas companies, said in a statement.

""Today, the U.S. has only one fully operational large-scale offshore wind project producing power,"" Milito said. ""That is not enough to meet America's rising energy needs. We need more energy of all types, including oil and gas, wind, and new and emerging technologies.""

The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management didn't respond to messages seeking comment.

Industry analysts have said that limiting renewable energy development amid rising electricity demand threatens to drive up power prices across the country.

""This is not the first time extreme partisan politics has derailed sound energy policy,"" Jason Grumet, chief executive of American Clean Power, an industry group, said in a statement responding to the Trump administration's stop-work order to Revolution Wind. ""The unfortunate message to investors is clear: the U.S. is no longer a reliable place for long-term energy investments.""

In April, the Interior Department halted work on an offshore wind project near the coast of Long Island. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum wrote in a letter to the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management at the time that approval of the project, called Empire Wind, ""was rushed through by the prior administration without sufficient analysis.""

Construction on Empire Wind resumed in May when the Trump administration lifted the stop-work order. But the disruption was costly for the project's developer, a Norwegian company called Equinor. The firm recently cut the value of its investment by almost $1 billion, mainly because of ""the changes in regulations for future offshore wind projects in the U.S.,"" Torgrim Reitan, Equinor's chief financial officer, said on an earnings call in July.

""For the second time, the Trump Administration has taken unlawful action against a fully permitted offshore wind project under active construction — this time one that is nearly 80% complete,"" Liz Burdock, chief executive of the Oceantic Network, an advocacy group for offshore wind, said in a statement about the Revolution Wind project.

""This dramatic action further erodes investor confidence in the U.S. market across all industries and undermines progress on shared national priorities — shipyard revitalization, steel and port investments, and energy dominance,"" Burdock said. ""In fact, halting work on Revolution Wind will drive up energy costs for consumers, idle Gulf Coast vessel operators that have invested hundreds of millions of dollars in new or retrofitted vessels, and jeopardize the livelihoods of union workers.""

Benjamin Franklin’s noted idiom about two things that are inevitable, may need tweaking.

Along with death and taxes, today increasing electric bills should be considered inevitable as well.

Electric consumers in New Hampshire are about to be hit with significant increases for the cost of the power and for distribution and transmission as the long neglected infrastructure is being upgraded with the costs spread to all ratepayers in New England.

New Hampshire and New England have a history of some of the highest electric rates in the country for a number of reasons including the lack of native fuels like oil or natural gas. As one former state consumer advocate used to explain it, New England is the tailpipe of the electric system and everyone has added a charge along the line.

After Public Service of NH — now Eversource — went bankrupt and emerged as part of the Northeast Utilities group, the seven 4.5 percent yearly rate increases to pay off the cost of taking over the utility put New Hampshire at the top of the nation for electric rates and brought on the deregulation of the electric portion of the industry.

The state has long been dependent on fossil fuels to generate electricity and with the last coal-fired plant in New England in Bow, to oil and more recently natural gas to go along with the Seabrook Nuclear Plant.

The current presidential administration wants to ensure its oligarchical friends and funders, many of whom became multi-billionaires through the fossil fuel industry, continue to feed at the trickle-up trough draining money from the other 99 percent.

This administration is ending tax credits for solar panels and other alternative fuel sources as well as electric vehicles, and last week ordered a nearly complete wind generating project off the coast of Rhode Island to stop construction.

Wind farms have proliferated in other areas of the country and have provided considerable power at what are now stable and competitive prices.

Coupled with battery storage systems they are a more reliable power supply than in the past.

In New Hampshire, we are all too aware of the hunger for hydro generated power from Quebec in Massachusetts and the unsuccessful Northern Pass Transmission project, but with the growing demand for electricity in that province, Hydro Quebec is not the source of readily available cheap and non-fossil fuel generated power it once was.

At the same time, the once plentiful supplies of natural gas that were relatively cheap are drying up as more and more of the gas is turned into liquified natural gas and sold on the world market, making the price much more volatile here at home.

New Hampshire and New England are most dependent on natural gas to generate power and that is one of the reasons the price is going up and up and up.

Another cost generator is the lack of an adequate supply of natural gas particularly in the cold winter months when many homes and buildings are heated by natural gas and they are the priority during extended cold spells. Power generators have to turn to liquified natural gas to power their plants at much higher prices as they compete with the rest of the world, mostly Europe, for the commodity.

The inadequate supply had Gov. Kelly Ayotte calling for revisiting a mothballed proposed natural gas pipeline running from the natural gas rich Marcellus Shale under Pennsylvania, New York and West Virginia to the Boston area.

The proposal was backed by several states including New Hampshire when Maggie Hassan was governor, but met strong resistance wherever the route was proposed and ultimately fell apart when electric utilities failed to agree to purchase the gas under guaranteed long-term contracts.

Never mind that it would take many years to engineer, site and work through the regulatory agencies in several states for a new pipeline project, but the guaranteed purchase issue is not likely to change as long as the transmission line through Maine to bring Hydro Quebec power to Maine and Massachusetts is viable as is another transmission line along western New England that is already permitted to carry more Hydro Quebec power.

With the current administration’s hostility to all but fossil fuel generated electricity and its carbon emissions further fueling global warming, the price of electricity has only one way to go and that is up.

Several bills passed by the Republican controlled legislature during the 2025 session cemented that scenario in place with a revised state energy plan putting the thumb on the fossil fuel scale and eliminating the state’s wind development agency.

At the same time, the Free State/Libertarian cohort in the legislature successfully pushed bills to encourage the development of data centers in the state.

One bill signed into law, would allow small, self-contained nuclear generating units to be used off grid and free of regulation by the Public Utilities Commission to power the potential data centers.

Data centers host the ICloud and other mega clouds, and are essential crypto currency transactions and the exploding AI industry.

The centers are proliferating around the country and in many cases are grouped together in states like Georgia, Colorado, Texas, Arizona and Louisiana.

These data centers use a tremendous amount of electricity and also water to cool the computers with some proposed centers requiring a million gallons of water a day.

The centers are often located in areas with cheap electricity but often with scarce water supplies causing surrounding homes and businesses to lose their water supply or to render it unusable.

Because the centers require a tremendous amount of electricity, the electric distribution systems have to be upgraded and in most cases the cost is spread to the utilities’ other customers.

The massive use of electricity has in some cases disrupted the area grid and are also security threats.

There are no data centers in New Hampshire today, but the Free State/Libertarians in the legislature would like New Hampshire to be the region’s go to place for data centers.

By allowing the centers to operate without regulation opens Pandora’s Box as yet one more group escapes the socialization of costs for the rest of the people and businesses in New Hampshire. The same group is pushing that scenario in other areas as well like education and health care.

At a time when electricity costs are skyrocketing and the current administration is cutting off alternative sources for generation, the state does not need a new questionable industry setting up shop and disrupting the system further and putting pressure on the water supply.

And the already exploding electric prices will shoot up like a Space X rocket.

Boosting Clean, Local Energy Production In addition to boosting the local economy, Community Solar also helps accelerate the production of local, renewable, and affordable clean energy.
National solar developer US Solar has partnered with New Mexico-based Sol Luna Solar to develop and build seven Community Solar Gardens throughout the state.","As the cost of living continues to rise, utility bills remain a major expense for many households and business owners. As a result, interest in solar energy is growing. But for many, the high upfront cost of installing solar panels at home or on their business is a barrier. Fortunately, there’s an alternative: Community Solar, a solution that’s gaining popularity across the country. New Mexico’s program is relatively new, with some projects just entering construction and energizing in the next year.

But what exactly is a Community Solar Garden (CSG)? In simple terms, a CSG is a large solar system located on a plot of land, allowing multiple subscribers — such as residents, renters, small businesses, or community organizations — to benefit from solar energy without having to install panels on their own property. By subscribing to a CSG, participants contribute to generating local, clean energy for their utility company. The electricity that is generated is then fed into the local power grid, and subscribers receive monthly credits on their utility bills based on their share of the energy that has been produced.

This model eliminates common barriers to going solar, allowing participants to lower their electricity bills while supporting local clean energy — a true win-win. And in a place like sunny New Mexico, the potential is huge. CSGs offer a wide range of benefits, so let's dig in.

Accessing the Benefits of Clean Energy: One of the primary advantages of Community Solar is accessibility. Factors like roof orientation, homeownership status and structural limitations can keep homeowners, renters, and small businesses alike from installing solar panels. Community Solar programs completely remove those barriers, making it possible for all to enjoy the benefits of solar energy, including renters, those who live in apartments, and households that simply can’t afford the upfront costs of a rooftop solar system. In fact, many state programs are designed to prioritize access for low-to-moderate income households.

Financial Savings and Lower Electric Costs: For many, financial savings are one of the most attractive benefits of participating in Community Solar. There are no upfront costs to join a CSG. Participants receive credits for the electricity their share of the garden generates and pay a smaller fee to the CSG operator, effectively lowering their electric bill. The result? Immediate and ongoing savings, without the cost, commitment, or maintenance that comes with owning solar panels. On average, US Solar expects households subscribed to our New Mexico projects to save approximately $16 per month on their utility bills.

Economic Advancement and Local Job Creation: Building Community Solar Gardens stimulates local economies. The construction and maintenance of these projects create both permanent and temporary local jobs in fields like engineering, installation, and landscaping. And because these projects are located within the same utility territory as their subscribers, the benefits stay local. In more rural areas, hosting a solar garden can provide a stable income for farmers and landowners who lease out their underused land for solar development. Supporting an initiative that boosts the local economy and benefits its residents is truly invaluable.

Boosting Clean, Local Energy Production In addition to boosting the local economy, Community Solar also helps accelerate the production of local, renewable, and affordable clean energy. Getting more clean energy on the grid close to where it’s being consumed is becoming increasingly important as energy demand and electricity costs continue to rise across our country. Community Solar is one way to help meet the increasing need for power.

National solar developer US Solar has partnered with New Mexico-based Sol Luna Solar to develop and build seven Community Solar Gardens throughout the state. That adds up to nearly 34 MWdc of clean, renewable energy — enough to power 8,000 homes. In addition to small businesses and municipalities, we expect to serve almost 4,000 income-qualified households, connecting them with meaningful savings on their utility bills.

Ultimately, Community Solar Gardens are more than just a way to generate clean electricity — they deliver financial, economic, and environmental benefits that all residents of New Mexico can enjoy. They represent a powerful shift toward a more equitable and sustainable energy future. In a state like sunny New Mexico, the benefits of CSGs could be life changing. They’re an opportunity everyone should consider.","https://www.lcsun-news.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/07/24/PTX1/85361776007-carne-solar-project-march-20251.JPG?crop=3891,2190,x0,y0&width=3200&height=1802&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-08-23 23:59:12.234149

With global competition for rare earth elements intensifying, Southeast Asia's untapped deposits are becoming more strategically valuable.","From nickel processing plants in Indonesia to rare earth mines in Myanmar, Chinese companies are expanding operations in sectors that environmentalists warn could have severe long-term consequences for rivers, air quality and local communities.

The shift is driven partly by stricter rules and excess industrial capacity in China, as well as by the lure of cheaper labor, weaker environmental enforcement and resource-rich landscapes in neighboring countries.

While Beijing has become Southeast Asia's biggest financier of clean energy, analysts say its green investments are often overshadowed by its involvement in some of the region's most polluting industries.

The result is a complicated picture: Chinese capital is helping to build solar farms and hydropower dams, but also fueling environmental disputes, health risks and rising political tensions.

It's also putting the spotlight on whether Southeast Asian governments are as committed to protecting the environment as they say.

""The reality is that most governments care more about economic development than they do environmental sustainability; exactly as the Chinese government did,"" Zachary Abuza, professor at the National War College in Washington, D.C., told DW.

Rising pushback in Indonesia

Since late last year, there have been protests and strikes at several Chinese-run nickel processing plants in Indonesia.

In July, Jakarta announced it would sanction companies for environmental violations at the sprawling Morowali Industrial Park nickel hub, run by the Chinese metals giant Tsingshan Holding Group, on the island of Sulawesi.

In February, the US government-funded security nonprofit C4ADS found that more than three-quarters of Indonesia's nickel refining capacity is controlled by Chinese companies, many with ties to the government in Beijing.

Two firms alone, including Tsingshan, account for more than 70% of Indonesia's refining capacity.

""A lack of domestic control leaves Indonesia reliant upon Chinese investment… which may limit the government's ability to hold the industry accountable,"" the report said.

Are Chinese firms polluting the Mekong River?

Pushback has also grown over allegations that Chinese firms are polluting vast stretches of the Mekong River through expanded rare earth extraction in war-torn Myanmar.

Communities in Laos and Thailand have complained in recent months about spikes in arsenic and other toxic metals.

In June, Thailand's pollution agency tested water in northern Chiang Mai and Chiang Rai — across the border from Myanmar's Shan State, a mining hot spot — and found arsenic levels nearly five times higher than international drinking water standards.

A report by the Institute for Strategy and Policy in Myanmar found that the number of rare earth mines in one state has nearly tripled to about 370 since the military coup in 2021.

Thai officials and parliamentarians have pressed Beijing to curb the environmental impact of these operations, prompting China's embassy in Bangkok to insist that all Chinese firms ""comply with the laws of the host country and… conduct their business in a legal and orderly fashion at all times.""

Pianporn Deetes, campaigns director at NGO International Rivers, warned that the risk is ""expected to become even more concentrated and persistent"" with the planned, Chinese-funded Pak Beng hydropower dam in Laos, which ""could trap and accumulate polluted sediments in its reservoir.""

China's green push

There's mounting criticism, but: China is also Southeast Asia's largest investor in renewable energy.

The international research organization Zero Carbon Analytics reported in June that China poured more than $2.7 billion (€2.3 billion) into clean energy projects in the region over the last decade, largely through the state-led Belt and Road Initiative.

However, Chinese companies are simultaneously expanding into pollution-heavy sectors.

An article in Nikkei Asia by Soon Cheong Poon and Guanie Lim of Japan's National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies noted that ""pollution-heavy industries are leaving China… and settling in smaller Southeast Asian countries.""

These include the waste-paper and iron and steel industries.

""Facing stricter environmental regulations and excess capacity at home, Chinese steelmakers have turned to Southeast Asia since 2017,"" the article said.

Lim told DW that avoiding US tariffs is another motivation for relocation.

""These plants, because of their scale, tend to create employment and linkages to the broader industrial ecosystem. However, many of these jobs are low-paying and pose health hazards,"" she said.

Fengshi Wu, associate professor in political science and international relations at the University of New South Wales in Australia, noted that several Southeast Asian states, especially Indonesia, have adopted ""resource nationalism,"" introducing export bans to ensure minerals are processed domestically.

This allows them to gain value-added profits from resource extraction, rather than simply exporting the raw materials for foreign companies to make the bulk of the revenue.

""Indonesia would like to see more minerals processed inside the country. So comes the pollution, unless more effective environmental pollution measures are taken,"" Wu said.

The bigger picture

Ultimately, analysts say the issue comes down to supply and demand.

""China has some of the world's most experienced, capable companies in some of the most polluting, high-environmental-impact sectors,"" Juliet Lu, assistant professor in the School for Public Policy and Global Affairs at the University of British Columbia, Canada, told DW.

These sectors are increasingly shunned by development finance institutions but remain attractive to Southeast Asian governments eager for rapid economic growth.

With global competition for rare earth elements intensifying, Southeast Asia's untapped deposits are becoming more strategically valuable.

""The question that is not asked frequently enough is whether and how non-Chinese companies operating in the same sectors and country contexts do things differently,"" Lu said.

""If Chinese company violations are more egregious than others, where are the positive levers to push both in China and in the host country?""

At the end of the day, she added, China's funds, technical expertise and services are in high demand, and ""countries like Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, who want roads built, energy infrastructure established or mines opened have multiple reasons they turn to China.""

Used EVs are ‘outperforming’ other fuel types at auction

While almost all cars depreciate the second they leave the lot, studies have found that EVs are particularly hard hit.

One recent study found that gas cars declined at around 3.1 percent in price, whereas the figure for EVs was an astonishing 31.8 percent.

And a Tesla owner found this out for himself when he took his Model Y to WeBuyAnyCar only to be offered around half of the $70,000 he paid for it.

In the US July was almost the best-selling month ever for EVs, while over in the UK, used EVs are currently experiencing a strong performance at auction.

UK-based BCA recently released figures confirming that EV cars currently had the highest first-time conversion of any fuel type, meaning they were the most likely type of vehicle to sell on their first listing.

They also had the strongest CAP performance of any fuel type.

“BCA’s inventory levels remain healthy for the summer months – we continue to sell more than 1,000 used EVs every week, so supply issues are not driving the daily strong price performance we are seeing in this sector,” COO at BCA, Stuart Pearson, said.

“Many motor trade buyers have realized both the incredible value and the profit opportunity that many EVs represent, given the growing acceptance from consumers for electric vehicles.”

How to get more cash for your used EV

Pearson went on to share some handy tips on getting more money when selling your used EV.

“There are new levels of sophistication that every seller should be using to ensure that EVs reach their optimum price in the market,” he said in a statement.

“This includes investing in the right level of pre-sale preparation, describing them properly with in-depth information covering not just the cosmetic and mechanical condition, but also the health of the battery, and aligning all of this with real-time pricing intelligence to support accurate decision making.”",https://supercarblondie.com/wp-content/uploads/ev_sales.webp,N,,2025-08-24 02:00:03.484981

The $1.5 billion project promised to provide electricity to hundreds of thousands of homes in Rhode Island and Connecticut.
Approval for a wind energy project off the coast of Long Island was also rescinded in April, although Burgum later reversed course, allowing construction on the renewable energy farm to continue.
Instead of pursuing energy development branded as climate-friendly under the Biden administration, Burgum has pursued oil and gas projects, which were restricted during the Biden era in an effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.","“Ørsted is evaluating all options to resolve the matter expeditiously,” the company wrote in a statement. “This includes engagement with relevant permitting agencies for any necessary clarification or resolution as well as through potential legal proceedings, with the aim being to proceed with continued project construction towards COD in the second half of 2026.”

The marks follow through on Trump’s commitment to target wind and solar projects if he won reelection as he campaigned for a second term last year.

“They destroy everything, they’re horrible, the most expensive energy there is,” Trump said of wind farms during a rally in May 2024. “They ruin the environment, they kill the birds, they kill the whales.”

Revolution Wind was authorized by the Biden administration two years ago. The $1.5 billion project promised to provide electricity to hundreds of thousands of homes in Rhode Island and Connecticut.

However, the wind industry has weathered a number of storms in the Trump era due to concerns from Interior Secretary Doug Burgum and others that the projects are highly “inefficient” and “unreliable” uses of federal lands compared to energy sources with smaller footprints, such as nuclear, gas, and oil.

Federal subsidization of such projects has been targeted, including through Trump’s recently signed into law “big, beautiful” bill, while government reviews authorizing them have become more stringent, lengthening the already bureaucratic permitting process. Burgum said in late July that such actions were warranted due to the belief that Biden-era officials had given green energy developments “special treatment.”

Burgum has canceled several high-profile wind energy projects previously authorized under the Biden administration, aside from the Rhode Island development, including a massive Idaho wind farm earlier this month.

“We are protecting tens of thousands of acres from harmful wind policy while shielding the interests of rural Idaho communities,” he said at the time.

Approval for a wind energy project off the coast of Long Island was also rescinded in April, although Burgum later reversed course, allowing construction on the renewable energy farm to continue.

Instead of pursuing energy development branded as climate-friendly under the Biden administration, Burgum has pursued oil and gas projects, which were restricted during the Biden era in an effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. While wind projects are still an option for regions where the elements are conducive to the policy, “not every state is lucky to have the resources” that lend themselves to wind farms, Burgum has argued, saying the U.S. has “to have the right balance.”

FINAL HOUSE GOP MEGABILL ACCELERATES CLEAN ENERGY CUTS, WITH RELIEF FOR NUCLEAR

“President Trump is avoiding the Biden blackouts and brownouts that were potentially put right on our doorstep because of the energy policies of the prior administration. He’s going 180 degrees in the other direction with energy dominance,” Burgum said in April.",https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/burgum.jpg,N,,2025-08-24 02:00:08.377558

The renewables obligation has grown from nothing to cost every UK home more than £100 a year – and it’s set to keep growing even though it was abolished eight years ago.

The green energy subsidy was closed to new entrants in 2017, but is still poised to add £38bn to UK power bills over the next five years, documents from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) have revealed.

A decision by the Labour politicians who created it 25 years ago means costs are still rising – and it will add an average £108 to every household power bill this year.

The renewables obligation was a scheme set up by Tony Blair’s government to encourage developers to build more green energy generation capacity, such as wind and solar farms, and to push suppliers to buy more clean power.

But a decision to link the cost of the scheme to an outdated measure of inflation has led to spiralling costs, meaning the renewables obligation is now by far the biggest of the six main green levies added to Britain’s power bills.

It has added over £75bn to the nation’s energy bills between its introduction in 2002 and now – and it will continue rising.

The “zombie” levy cost £6.7bn in 2023-24, according to the OBR, but this is forecast to jump to £8.5bn by 2026, a 25pc increase.

It implies annual household energy bills could increase by at least another £20 over the next two to three years simply because of the subsidy.

John Constable, director of the Renewable Energy Foundation, a charity focused on energy data transparency, said successive governments had lost control of the system, with consumers paying the price.

“Even though it was killed off for new entrants in 2017, the renewables obligation system is still costing consumers more each year.

“A combination of bad initial design and foolish revisions favouring the wind and solar industries has turned the system into a zombie levy, devouring householder cash and sucking the blood from our businesses. Any future government that wishes to restore the UK to economic health will have to use primary legislation to finally kill it off.”

‘Stealth tax on households’

The origins of the “zombie” levy go back to 2000 and Blair’s first government. Stephen Byers, the then-business and energy secretary, piloted the Utility Act 2000 through Parliament, which enabled the renewables obligation system.

Under the scheme, electricity generators could claim a renewable obligation certificate, or ROC, for each megawatt hour produced from renewables such as wind, solar or hydropower.

Separately, suppliers – the companies that bring power into our homes and businesses – had to hand over a specified number of ROCs to Ofgem, the regulator, each year.

The system immediately created a market for these green energy certificates, with suppliers effectively forced to buy them from renewable generators.

Since the cost of a ROC was close to the cost of a megawatt hour, the scheme typically doubled green energy generators’ income.

Since trading was between businesses, the system wasn’t clearly flagged on energy bills. But consumers were ultimately paying for them through higher power prices as suppliers passed on the cost.

The scheme was implemented in 2002 under Byers’ successor, Patrica Hewitt, also Labour, creating what some have called the ultimate Whitehall stitch-up of consumers.

The real damage lay in a single decision: to link the cost of these green certificates to the retail price index (RPI).

Ministers wanted to link ROCs to inflation to ensure they kept their real-terms value. However, economists view RPI as a discredited measure that massively overstates the inflation rate.

The Office for National Statistics agrees and relies on a different measure, the consumer price index (CPI).

The difference between the two is stark. Since January 2002, prices have risen by 88.5pc according to the CPI, but on the RPI, they are up 133.4pc.

The linkage of ROCs to RPI has created a massive and continuing windfall for the 26,000 or so renewables generators that registered for the system.

For consumers, it has meant ever bigger bills to fund that windfall.

A second separate decision has amplified the impact. The ROC scheme was meant to encourage development of new renewable generation capacity. But that risked leaving schemes built before 2002 out in the cold. Those built after that date could juice their profits by selling ROCs, leaving legacy generators struggling to keep up.

So they were allowed to join too. About 600 such generators did just that, with the oldest being a hydropower plant built at Kinlochleven, in Scotland, in 1909.

Drax, Britain’s largest coal-fired power station, was also allowed to claim ROCs after converting its boilers to run on wood shipped from the US.

It argues such power is renewable, enabling it to claim green certificates worth £617m in 2022 and £587m in 2023. Overall it has been paid £6.2bn under the renewables obligation system, making it among the scheme’s biggest beneficiaries.

Ed Miliband reviewed the system during his first stint as energy secretary in 2009, awarding offshore wind developers and others extra certificates for each megawatt hour generated to incentivise developers.

That change just increased the costs. By 2015, ROCs were adding £40 to the annual domestic bill and becoming a costly political embarrassment.

Greg Clark, the then-energy secretary, closed the scheme to new entries in 2017 and replaced it with the contracts for difference system, a different subsidy scheme also inflation-linked – but to the CPI.

For projects already in the ROC system, however, the bonanza will continue until 2037 – as will the costs to consumers. The impact on household bills rose to £79 in 2020 and £108 this year, about 11pc of the average power bill.

By 2028 it could be more than £130.

Sam Dumitriu, of Britain Remade, a campaign group, says that ROCs did some good in getting renewables off the ground in the early days.

But he adds: “It isn’t right that struggling households pay the cost of legacy subsidies like ROCs. At a time when we are trying to persuade people to buy EVs and install heat pumps, it is counterproductive to make electricity more expensive.

“They are, in essence, a regressive stealth tax on households. It would be fairer to shift costs like this on to general taxation.”

‘Expensive disaster’

Green energy certificates are driving up prices for business and industry too.

Patrick Matthewson, of Make UK, a trade body for manufacturers, says: “The renewable obligation is the biggest policy cost that UK manufacturers face. These costs act as a drag on industrial competitiveness.

“Removing the renewable obligation from manufacturers’ electricity bills would provide immediate and significant cost relief without compromising any ongoing policy objective.”

In Ofgem’s latest annual report on the ROC scheme, Neil Lawrence, the regulator’s “director of schemes”, mounts a staunch defence of the system.

He said it “made an impressive contribution to the Government’s ambitions for green energy” by “providing millions of UK households and businesses with a secure supply of clean electricity”.

“Renewable electricity accounted for a record 46.4pc of the electricity generated in the UK in 2023, and the RO’s role in this has been pivotal,” he wrote.

Yet the sheer size of the scheme, and its costs to consumers and businesses, means it is becoming increasingly political.

Richard Tice, Reform Party energy spokesman, said: “These ROCs have been an expensive disaster for British households who have been lumbered with ever higher electricity bills.

“Reform will scrap stupid net zero that has caused all these extra costs and destroyed many tens of thousands of jobs.”

Claire Coutinho, energy secretary in the last Conservative government and now shadow energy spokeswoman, said consumers were paying a huge price for Miliband’s flawed revision of the ROC system.

“The renewable obligation was Ed Miliband’s baby … Every family in Britain is still facing higher energy bills thanks to the extortionate contracts he signed back in 2009,” she said.

“The Energy Secretary needs to get a grip, avoid the mistakes he made in 2009, and start putting cheap energy first.”

A spokesman for Miliband’s Department for Energy Security and Net Zero said: “The renewables obligation scheme laid the foundation for today’s thriving clean energy sector – driving down the costs of wind and solar power.

“Through these levies, we are delivering value for money for taxpayers, while driving investment in renewables and other generation technologies.”",https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/business/2025/08/22/TELEMMGLPICT000432995190_17558781656830_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqqVzuuqpFlyLIwiB6NTmJwarI9ukQAzz8J0u7PEbMdV0.jpeg?impolicy=OG-Standard,N,,2025-08-24 00:59:33.556868

Atmospheric carbon dioxide is the “master dial” of Earth’s temperature, Tierney said: When carbon dioxide is up, Earth’s temperature goes up, and when carbon dioxide is down, Earth’s temperature goes down.

All five members of the Arizona Corporation Commission belong to Pres.
They are guaranteed returns for their investors in the range of 10% by the decisions of the corporation commission.","In the last 485 million years, there has only been one period when Earth’s temperature rose nearly as fast as it is rising now.

That happened about 250 million years ago. It produced the End-Permian Extinction, also known as the “Great Dying,” when about 90 percent of the species on Earth died off.

The temperature rose so fast, due apparently to volcanic eruptions and the release of carbon dioxide, that the evolution of most of Earth’s life couldn’t keep up with the speed of Earth’s heating.

“The rate of warming right now is faster than anything we know about, even faster than 250 million years ago,” said Prof. Jessica Tierney, a University of Arizona paleoclimatologist who helped lead the study that charted Earth’s temperature over all those millennia.

Atmospheric carbon dioxide is the “master dial” of Earth’s temperature, Tierney said: When carbon dioxide is up, Earth’s temperature goes up, and when carbon dioxide is down, Earth’s temperature goes down.

Arizona’s utility regulators have one finger among many on that master dial. The five members of the Arizona Corporation Commission can decide if we in Arizona are going to contribute more or less to the surge of carbon dioxide going into Earth’s atmosphere, now putting us on a pace for another possible mass extinction.

But nobody seemed too conscious of the Great Dying when they discussed a renewable-energy mandate at the Aug. 14 Arizona Corporation Commission meeting. This 20-year-old rule required Arizona’s regulated utilities to generate at least 15 percent of their energy from renewable sources by this year, 2025, a small percentage in retrospect.

They could have considered a new, higher mandate, but in 2023, the commission rejected the idea of requiring regulated utilities to get all their energy from renewables by 2050, or even by 2070. They turned against the idea of such mandates altogether.

The politics of the moment

On Aug. 14, three concepts dominated the commission members’ conversation: Affordability, reliability and free markets. Not the threat of climate disaster. In ignoring the climate implications of their decision to start eliminating clean-energy mandates, they reflected the nihilistic politics of the moment.

All five members of the Arizona Corporation Commission belong to Pres. Donald Trump’s party, the GOP. And Trump has set the tone when it comes to renewable energy — it is “THE SCAM OF THE CENTURY,“ in his distorted view, expressed online Wednesday.

What he wants is a return to carbon-dioxide emitting fossil fuels, an industry that — coincidentally, I’m sure — donated generously to his campaign. They quickly reaped the reward. On his first day in office, Trump issued an executive order that attempted to destroy federal efforts at climate-change mitigation, while opening federal lands to greater energy exploitation.

On April 8, Trump issued an executive order on “Reinvigorating America’s Beautiful Clean Coal Industry” that encouraged further exploitation of coal on federal lands and use of it to power data centers, despite the fact that there is no such thing as clean coal.

On July 4, came the real triumph for the carbon-dioxide spewers: The Big Beautiful Bill contains billions in giveaways to the fossil-fuel industry, including reducing the royalties the industry must pay for mining and exploitation on federal lands.

The bill also is ending tax incentives for renewable energy development, included in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, that were spurring blue-collar jobs and clean-energy growth around the United States.

The pathological hatred of renewable energy goes so deep that the Trump administration, on Friday, ordered a halt to construction of a wind-energy project that was largely complete off of Rhode Island’s shore. When complete, it would produce enough energy to power about 350,000 homes.

The federal energy policy is, in short, a nihilistic climate disaster, spurring the carbon-dioxide companies to pollute more, faster. And Arizona’s Corporation Commission is stepping in line.

Arizona utilities are regulated

Commissioners such as Tucson’s Lea Marquez Peterson put their decision in the language of the free market.

“I hear from lobbyists frequently that today solar is one of the cheapest sources of energy,” Marquez-Peterson said at the Aug. 14 meeting. “That’s exactly why I support the elimination of a subsidy today. Based upon market demands and the low cost of solar, I believe that renewable energy will continue to thrive in Arizona.”

But the fact is, Arizona’s utilities do not operate in a free market. Here, the regulated utilities, like Tucson Electric Power and Arizona Public Service, are monopolies in their service areas. They are guaranteed returns for their investors in the range of 10% by the decisions of the corporation commission.

They make back the cost of every plant they build, plus profit. It is a system that incentivizes building expensive infrastructure such as power plants.

It’s very different here than in Texas, which has its own grid and a real competitive system for buying power. As a result, wind and solar power have boomed there.

In 2022 alone, a year of high natural-gas prices due to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, renewables reduced Texas wholesale energy costs by $11 billion, concluded Joshua Rhodes, a research scientist at the University of Texas who is writing a new report on more recent impacts. The savings then were about $200 per household over five years.

In a monopoly market like ours, he said Friday, mandates may be necessary to expand renewables because utilities have existing infrastructure they want to pay off.

“Say they buy an asset that turns out not to be competitive or the most efficient,” Rhodes said. “They’re probably going to utilize that asset for its expected lifetime even though there are more efficient ways of doing things, because there are sunk costs.”

Mandates make progress

Without a competitive market in Arizona, we can’t be guaranteed that the cheapest energy source will be used. So, mandates and pledges to use more renewables have been important to the progress we’ve made.

Even Marquez Peterson indirectly acknowledged the importance of such pledges in bringing renewables to market when she noted that many Big Tech companies are looking to place facilities in Arizona.

“Most of them, like Microsoft, Google and Amazon, have their own ambitious clean energy goals and are requesting clean energy generation sources, which influence the energy portfolio of the future for our regulated utilities,” she said.

Our utilities, too, have had such goals. Tucson Electric Power has committed to retiring its coal-burning plants by 2032 and to get more than 70% of its power from solar and wind by 2035.

Arizona Public Service, the state’s largest utility, also had a commitment of its own: To get 100% of its power from zero-carbon sources by 2050, and 65% from renewable sources by 2030. On Aug. 6, the company’s CEO said the company is abandoning that pledge in favor of a vaguer commitment to be “carbon-neutral” by 2050.

While TEP’s staying on course is commendable, none of these pledges is, of course, enforceable. Mandates are. And as a body regulating monopoly utilities, the corporation commission should not pretend it is overseeing a free market. It should regulate them, considering long-term threats along with short-term costs and benefits.

After all, they have a finger on the master dial and can turn down Arizona’s carbon-dioxide emissions, helping a bit to slow the dangerous heating of the planet.

By Lauren Teichner | Aug. 23, 2025

Red alert. The Trump Administration is now going after the very cornerstone of U.S. climate action: the Environmental Protection Agency’s 2009 Endangerment Finding. This landmark legal and scientific determination is what gives the EPA its authority to regulate climate pollution under the Clean Air Act.

On Aug. 1, 2025, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin filed a proposed rule that would “repeal all . . . emission standards for light-duty, medium-duty, and heavy-duty vehicles and engines,” which includes cars, power plants, and other major sources of carbon emissions. This proposed rule is one of the most consequential Trump moves you may never have heard about. It is a brazen attempt to erase science, dismantle climate protections, and rewrite the law to benefit polluters.

The legal basis for limiting this dangerous pollution is unequivocal. In the landmark 2007 case Massachusetts v. EPA, the U.S. Supreme Court held that greenhouse gases are pollutants under the Clean Air Act and that the EPA has a legal obligation to regulate them if it determines they endanger public health or welfare. That’s exactly what the EPA did in 2009, issuing the Endangerment Finding after an exhaustive review of peer-reviewed science and more than 380,000 public comments.

Since then, every major legal challenge to the Endangerment Finding has failed. Never before has an administration attempted to overturn it. Zeldin’s effort to do so now isn’t just unprecedented, it’s a direct attack on the rule of law, science-based policymaking, the public’s right to clean air, and efforts to protect our planet for future generations. It’s like pretending cigarettes don’t cause cancer or that seatbelts don’t save lives.

The science underpinning the 2009 Endangerment Finding is not up for debate either. The science is even clearer today, 16 years—and countless climate disasters—later. Climate pollution is driving more extreme heat, catastrophic floods (like the recent horrific flooding in Texas), intense wildfires, and dangerous air quality.

These are lived realities, right here in Michigan and across the country. Children are missing summer camp and having asthma attacks because of smoke-filled air. Seniors are dying during heat waves. Farmers are struggling with unpredictable growing seasons and water shortages, leading to rising food prices.

The EPA’s job is to follow science, not twist it for political ends. And yet, in a disturbing contradiction, the agency is now claiming—on its own Instagram page, no less—that it is “fulfilling its mission to protect human health and the environment” even as it attempts to dismantle the very basis for regulating climate pollution.

Under the banner of its newly coined slogan, “Powering the Great American Comeback,” the EPA is abandoning its core duty in favor of polluter-friendly spin. The “environment” itself isn’t mentioned in that new slogan for a reason; ironically, protecting the environment is no longer part of the EPA’s agenda.

Let’s talk about what’s really going on here. Reversing the Endangerment Finding isn’t some technical policy tweak that you can ignore. It is a deliberate, full-scale assault on the very tools we rely on to protect public health and clean up our air.

If Zeldin succeeds in dismantling this cornerstone, the EPA will lose its legal authority to limit pollution from cars, trucks, power plants, oil refineries, and industrial facilities—the largest sources of greenhouse gas emissions in the country. The consequences would be immediate and far-reaching. More air pollution, more heat-related deaths, more respiratory illness, and more climate-driven disasters. Zeldin’s proposal serves polluter interests at the expense of the public interest.

In Michigan, we know what happens when the government turns a blind eye to science. Flint unfortunately taught us that. And according to the Environmental Law & Policy Center’s report Climate Change in the Midwest: 2025 Update (which you can find online), Michigan is already experiencing more extreme heat days, heavier rainfall events, and an increase in heat-related deaths and illnesses, as well as respiratory diseases. The report makes clear that climate change is not a distant threat—it’s a public health emergency already right here in Michigan.

The EPA should be protecting public health and the natural environment, not rewriting reality to suit polluters and their allies in Congress and the White House. This effort to erase the Endangerment Finding is a betrayal of the agency’s mission, the law, and the people it was created to serve.

Thankfully, we still have a chance to speak up. The EPA is accepting public comments on its proposal to reverse the 2009 Endangerment Finding through September 15, 2025. You can make your voice heard by submitting a comment (be sure to include Docket ID # EPA-HQ-OAR-2025-0194) at regulations.gov.

Tell the EPA that climate pollution is dangerous, that the science supporting the 2009 Endangerment Finding is stronger than ever, and that the agency must fulfill its legal and moral duty to protect our health, our air, and our children’s futures. Don’t let Administrator Zeldin kill and bury the important truths of the 2009 Endangerment Finding under a mountain of bureaucracy and spin.

Early adopters of electric vehicles in India are facing unexpected hurdles, including lengthy repair delays and insurance claim rejections. Unlike the established infrastructure for traditional vehicles, EV service networks are limited, leading to extended waiting periods. A significant issue is the lack of awareness regarding battery coverage, often an optional add-on.

When Ramesh Sharma bought his first electric vehicle (EV) last year, he believed he was making an environmentally conscious move that would also save him money in the long run. What he didn’t expect was to be stuck in a months-long nightmare just to get his car repaired after a minor battery issue.

His experience is becoming increasingly common among India's early EV adopters. As the country races toward its electric mobility goals, a growing number of e-car owners are reporting delays when they need to get the vehicles repaired, confusion over the insurance cover they need and even rejection of their claims.

Unlike the well-established network supporting vehicles with internal combustion engines (ICEs), the EV ecosystem is still in its infancy. Manufacturers have been cautious in expanding service centres, resulting in a handful of centralised hubs that are often far from both dealerships and customers. This gap leads to long waiting periods for repairs and complicated insurance processes.

“Comparing EVs with ICE vehicles isn’t appropriate,"" said Gaurav Arora, head of reinsurance, underwriting & claims for property and casualty at ICICI Lombard, India’s largest EV insurer. “The EV battery is like the engine, only more complex. Repairs take longer and specialised workshops are still few and far between.”

In ICE vehicles, minor claim approvals usually happen within a matter of hours. But for EVs, the process can stretch from two weeks to three months, experts say. It’s a mix of poor customer awareness, limited repair capabilities and a cumbersome approval chain that involves original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), insurance companies and dealerships that causes this delay.

Live Events

""Batteries make up nearly 40% of an EV’s cost,” a dealer said, requesting anonymity. ""We don’t stock them. Once an insurer approves the claim, we place an order. But that approval can take ages.” Until recently, EV batteries were only replaced, not repaired. That meant even minor issues could result in full battery replacements. On top of that, battery disposal is governed by environmental laws, adding another layer of complexity.

Lack of awareness

Now, OEMs are beginning to repair batteries or stock ""child parts,"" or individual components, to reduce turnaround time.

“Some OEMs have already initiated battery repair practices, and we have been encouraging others to follow suit,” said Arora. “We also advised OEMs to look into specific battery-related issues caused due to flooding or water logging, to help minimise such claims and improve the overall customer experience.”

But even as infrastructure slowly improves, another problem remains — consumer confusion.

Most EV buyers opt only for the primary insurance policy, unaware that the crucial battery cover is an optional add-on. When claims are denied, many are shocked to find out their policies didn’t include coverage for battery faults or water damage. ""Some customers buy insurance online just because it’s cheaper, not realising it doesn’t cover what they need,"" said a dealer. This has made EV insurance a costly proposition. Transporting damaged e-cars to far-off service centres drives up costs significantly. In some cases, the cost of transportation alone exceeds the value of the claim, prompting insurers to reject it altogether. Insurers and manufacturers acknowledge the issues, but say they’re temporary. Most leading OEMs, off the record, admitted the pain points. They’re betting on a dramatic ramp-up in service infrastructure over the next eight to 12 months, including opening more localised service hubs and conducting technician training programmes. ""We are continuously working to expand and enhance our service network and will soon introduce mobile service vans for EV servicing, bringing expert care directly to our customers’ doorstep,"" said Tarun Garg, chief operating officer at Hyundai Motors India, which has more than 400 dedicated EV service workshops covering nearly every city. “Our battery protection insurance plan safeguards one of the most valuable EV components, the battery along with charging cables,” he said.

“Collaboration is key,” said Arora. “We’re actively working with OEMs and dealers, feeding back customer pain points to improve response time and reduce claim costs.”

In the meantime, insurers are also urging EV owners to be proactive. Staying compliant with insurance regulations is crucial.

According to the rules of the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority, EVs must have third-party insurance. Skipping this can attract penalties besides claim rejections. While the rule on third-party insurance applies to all motor vehicles, some EV owners used to skip it believing that EVs don't need it. Frequent repricing of EV policies, driven by uncertainty around repair costs, has only added to customer anxiety.

Despite the challenges, experts remain optimistic.

As India’s EV ecosystem matures, smoother coordination between automakers and insurers will be vital. The hope is that early adopters won’t be penalised for their choice to go green.

,American Energy,2025-08-24 00:38:58+00:00,The Business Standard,How flawed policy keeps shutting gas-fired power plants amid fuel shortage,Shazzad Hossen,,,,,https://www.tbsnews.net/bangladesh/energy/how-flawed-policy-keeps-shutting-gas-fired-power-plants-amid-fuel-shortage-1218236,"Yet, the previous government kept approving gas-fired power plants without securing fuel.
Power Division Secretary Farzana Mamtaz put it bluntly: ""Power plants like Rupsha, Jera and others were not built in a planned manner without ensuring gas supply.""
""Those power plants are actually a pain for us,"" she told The Business Standard.
The 171MW Baghabari plant ran at just 2% plant factor, costing Tk43.36, while the 163MW Chandpur CC plant ran at 5% plant factor, costing Tk 20.04.
What's next When asked if Petrobangla plans to increase gas supply to power plants, AKM Mizanur Rahman, director (finance), said, ""We will not increase gas supply to power plants.","Policy backfires. These two words perfectly sum up Bangladesh's gas-based power strategy.

For two decades, the country has grappled with a widening gas shortage, even after importing LNG. Yet, the previous government kept approving gas-fired power plants without securing fuel.

The result is costly capacity payments for idle plants while the state misses out on cheaper electricity.

The latest victim is Jera's 718MW plant in Meghnaghat. It began commercial operation on 28 July but had to shut down in less than two weeks because Petrobangla could not supply the 130mmcfd of gas needed to run it.

And more trouble is brewing.

Four more large gas-fired plants, totalling 1,955MW, are expected online within 18 months. Together, they will demand an extra 615mmcfd, a figure power division officials admit is nearly impossible to manage given the current supply crunch.

Power Division Secretary Farzana Mamtaz put it bluntly: ""Power plants like Rupsha, Jera and others were not built in a planned manner without ensuring gas supply.""

""Those power plants are actually a pain for us,"" she told The Business Standard.

The problem is not only scarcity but also logistics.

Energy Adviser Muhammad Fouzul Kabir Khan explained Jera's rapid shutdown: ""Several gas-fired plants operate in Meghnaghat. We face both a gas shortage and distribution-line constraints. Jera had no option but to shut down.""

Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB) Chairman Md Rezaul Karim said they will compare the costs of upcoming plants with existing coal and liquid-fuel plants.

""We are considering how to supply gas to plants, but it will take time,"" he also said.

Natural gas remains Bangladesh's most cost-effective power source – Tk6–8 per unit, versus Tk12–15 for coal and Tk25–27 for liquid fuel.

Yet the irony is stark: the cheapest source is also the most unreliable.

Conditional nod for Jera

The government allowed Jera to declare its Commercial Operation Date (COD) on condition that it agreed to a substantial tariff reduction. However, Jera refused, arguing that any readjustment required approval from its financiers.

Energy Adviser Fouzul Kabir Khan said, ""We gave COD to JERA on the condition of lowering the tariff significantly. Otherwise, it would only receive enough gas to keep the plant technically running. That is why the plant was damaged.""

He also confirmed that no capacity payment would be made, as the agreement contained multiple conditions that had not been fulfilled.

Under the 2019 power purchase agreement, BPDB committed to buying electricity from the 718MW plant for 22 years at a levelised tariff of Tk5.85 per kilowatt-hour. However, currency depreciation could increase that figure by around 25%.

Regarding why the Jera plant was allowed to start operations despite the fuel not being secured, Secretary Farzana Mamtaz told TBS that under the power purchase agreement, the plant owner can issue the COD themselves after meeting certain conditions, even if the government has not issued it.

To inquire about the plant's shutdown amid the gas crisis and the Power Division's push for tariff renegotiation, TBS emailed Pei Yong, senior manager of Public Relations at Jera Asia, on Thursday but received no response.

Jera acquired the Meghnaghat power plant from India's Reliance Power in 2019. Following the acquisition, the project company was renamed Jera Meghnaghat Power Limited (JMPL) on 9 October 2024.

Status of plants in pipeline

BPDB data shows more projects are on the horizon. Ghorashal's repowering Unit-4, with 409MW capacity, is due by December 2025 and will require 275mmcfd of gas. Unit-3, a 156MW project, is scheduled for June 2026 and will need 100mmcfd. Both are nearly complete.

North-West Power Generation Company's 800MW Rupsha LNG-fired plant is scheduled for January 2027. The contract was signed in 2019, and construction has progressed around 75% so far.

Another LNG-fired plant, a 590MW combined-cycle project in Anwara, Chattogram, is owned by United-Chattogram Power. Scheduled for commercial operation in January 2027, the contract was signed on 28 October 2021, and construction is 66% complete.

Regarding the Rupsha plant, Adviser Fouzul Kabir said, ""We have decided to issue the COD so the plant receives gas solely for internal consumption, keeping it technically operational. Otherwise, it risks becoming inoperable.""

State of existing plants

Bangladesh has 51 gas-fired power plants with a combined capacity of 11,504MW, demanding 2,420mmcfd of gas but receiving only 850–1,050mmcfd, and accounting for 43% of the total 26,955MW generation capacity.

Out of the 51 plants, only 32 remain operational.

There are 21 gas-fired power plants under Titas Gas Transmission and Distribution Company with a total gas requirement of 996mmcfd, yet average supply hovers at just 300–320mmcfd.

Of these, 13 plants with a combined capacity of 3,306MW remain completely shut due to gas shortages, and none are operating at full capacity.

Under Bakhrabad Gas Distribution Company Limited (BGDCL), 15 gas-fired plants with a total capacity of 2,755MW require 423.9mmcfd of gas but receive only 189.8mmcfd.

The situation is more severe for Karnaphuli Gas Distribution Company Limited (KGDCL), where supply is just 45.3mmcfd against a demand of 185mmcfd.

Power plants under Jalalabad Gas Transmission and Distribution System Limited (JGTDSL) fare slightly better, receiving 269mmcfd against a demand of 395mmcfd. However, eight of its plants, totalling 652MW, have been offline for months.

At Pashchimanchal Gas Company Limited (PGCL), gas shortages have forced four plants, with a combined capacity of 222 MW, out of operation. Sundarban Gas Company Limited (SGCL) faces a demand of 174mmcfd but receives only 98.9mmcfd.

Demand higher than what Petrobangla says

According to Petrobangla, the country's gas demand on Thursday stood at around 3,800mmcfd, though energy experts often dismiss this figure as unrealistic. On average, Petrobangla supplies 2,500–2,600mmcfd, occasionally reaching 2,800–2,900mmcfd.

Energy expert Ijaz Hossain told TBS at a recent policy dialogue, ""Petrobangla's claim on gas demand is absurd. Actual requirements exceed 4,500mmcfd. Unable to meet the expected demand, Petrobangla reports a suppressed figure.""

Energy Secretary Mohammad Saiful Islam concurred, noting that real gas demand in the country could reach as high as 5,000mmcfd.

Impact of gas crisis on plant factor

The ongoing gas crisis has forced gas-based power plants to operate at reduced plant factors, driving up production costs. In FY24, gas-based plants ran at an average 32% plant factor, with overall generation costing Tk6.30 per unit.

A plant factor is a measure of how much electricity a power plant actually produces compared to its maximum possible output over a period of time.

BPDB data shows that higher plant factors significantly lower production costs. The 383MW Bibiyana (South) plant, for example, ran at 72% plant factor in FY24, producing electricity at Tk3.68 per unit. Similarly, the 400MW Bibiyana-3 operated at 78% plant factor, with a cost of Tk3.49 per unit.

In contrast, underperforming plants faced soaring costs. The 171MW Baghabari plant ran at just 2% plant factor, costing Tk43.36, while the 163MW Chandpur CC plant ran at 5% plant factor, costing Tk 20.04. The 105MW Tongi plant, with zero plant factor, recorded an astronomical Tk1,345.31.

By comparison, in FY23, the average plant factor was 35%, and generation cost was Tk5.13 per unit, highlighting how higher utilisation drives down costs.

Power Division Secretary Farzana Mamtaz noted, ""To start commercial operation, plants must have sufficient gas supply and transmission infrastructure. We can't guarantee gas for all plants at this stage.""

What's next

When asked if Petrobangla plans to increase gas supply to power plants, AKM Mizanur Rahman, director (finance), said, ""We will not increase gas supply to power plants. Our priority is to supply more gas to industry and fertiliser production.""

He added, ""BPDB must ration the currently allocated gas. They need to prioritise energy-efficient plants over less efficient ones. Plants that consume more gas but produce less should be phased out.""

On why Petrobangla is not importing more gas to support power generation, Rahman explained, ""We face financing and regasification constraints. The FSRU can operate at an average of 85% capacity. For maintenance and natural contingencies, it can't run at 100% year-round.""",https://www.tbsnews.net/sites/default/files/styles/social_share/public/images/2025/08/23/gas-shortage-hits-power-plants-fea.png,N,,2025-08-23 21:01:42.005730

While the government touts flagship projects like the AESC gigafactory in Sunderland and Agratas' £4 billion Somerset facility, these developments remain dwarfed by the scale and speed of China's industrial juggernaut and the EU's uneven but coordinated efforts. For investors, the UK's fragmented policy approach and delayed gigafactory rollout pose a high-risk environment for domestic automakers, even as global competitors leverage strategic underinvestment to secure market dominance.

The UK's Lag: Delays and Policy Fragmentation

The UK's gigafactory strategy is marked by both progress and paralysis. The AESC plant in Sunderland, backed by £1 billion in public and private funding, is set to produce 15.8 GWh annually by 2025—enough for 100,000 EVs. Agratas' Somerset project, meanwhile, aims to produce 40 GWh by the early 2030s. Yet these milestones pale against China's 2025 capacity of over 1,000 GWh, driven by state-backed giants like CATL and BYD. The UK's reliance on ad hoc subsidies and delayed permitting processes has created a vacuum where global rivals thrive.

The Policy Commission on Gigafactories, chaired by Lord Hutton, highlights the UK's need for a unified roadmap. However, its recommendations—expected in 2026—arrive too late to counter China's efficiency-driven model. Chinese manufacturers, with waste rates under 10% (vs. 30%-40% globally), dominate the lithium-iron-phosphate (LFP) cell market, a cheaper and safer technology critical for mainstream EVs. The UK's focus on nickel-manganese-cobalt (NMC) cells, while technologically advanced, lacks the cost advantages of LFP, further straining competitiveness.

Global Rivals: China's Dominance and the EU's Uneven Recovery

China's gigafactory ecosystem is a masterclass in industrial policy. Government subsidies, fast-tracked approvals, and access to raw materials have enabled CATL and BYD to scale production rapidly. Their LFP cells, now powering over 70% of global EVs, undercut European NMC alternatives by 20%-30% in cost. Meanwhile, the EU, despite its own challenges, is adopting a more cohesive strategy. Hungary's low-cost energy and subsidies have attracted investments like Agratas' Somerset plant, while the EU's Critical Raw Materials Act aims to secure supply chains.

The EU's struggles—high energy costs, permitting delays, and startup failures (e.g., Northvolt's scaled-back operations)—mirror the UK's issues. Yet the EU's recent €852 million in grants for battery projects and growing LFP capacity in Germany and Poland suggest a clearer path to self-sufficiency. The UK, by contrast, lacks comparable incentives, leaving its automakers exposed to volatile global supply chains.

Investment Implications: Capital Flows and Strategic Risks

For UK-based EV and battery firms, the risks are acute. Delays in gigafactory timelines and policy uncertainty could erode investor confidence, particularly as Chinese and EU rivals secure first-mover advantages. Agratas and AESC, despite their scale, face headwinds from supply chain bottlenecks and energy costs. Investors must weigh these risks against the UK's long-term net-zero goals and the potential for policy realignment.

Capital should prioritize firms aligning with policy trends. Agratas' Somerset project, for instance, benefits from government energy discounts and research funding, positioning it as a safer bet than unproven startups. Similarly, AESC's carbon-neutral energy model could attract ESG-focused investors. However, the UK's fragmented approach means even these projects require sustained public-private partnerships to succeed.

The Path Forward: Innovation and Resilience

To close the gap, the UK must shift from reactive to proactive investment. This includes:

1. Supply Chain Resilience: Diversifying raw material sources and investing in recycling infrastructure to reduce reliance on imports.

2. Policy Alignment: Streamlining permitting, offering direct subsidies for LFP cell production, and harmonizing trade agreements (e.g., the UK-US EV tariff reduction).

3. Strategic Partnerships: Leveraging the National Wealth Fund to co-invest in high-risk, high-reward projects, as seen in the AESC deal.

For investors, the UK's EV battery sector remains a high-stakes bet. While the government's long-term vision is ambitious, the absence of a cohesive strategy risks leaving domestic firms in the shadow of global giants. Those who bet on innovation, supply chain resilience, and policy-aligned projects may yet find opportunities in a market poised for transformation.

In a world where EVs define the next industrial revolution, the UK's ability to scale gigafactory capacity will determine not just its automotive future, but its place in the global energy economy.

This is the second major offshore wind project to be halted, following the temporary stop-work order on Empire Wind off the coast of New York [2].","The Trump administration has issued a stop-work order on Ørsted’s Revolution Wind project, an offshore wind farm that is approximately 80% complete and located 15 miles off the coast of Rhode Island [2]. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) cited unspecified “national security interests” and the need to “prevent interference with the exclusive economic zone, the high seas, and the territorial seas” [2]. The decision has sparked widespread criticism from state and federal officials, environmental advocates, and industry leaders, who argue it undermines progress on clean energy and jeopardizes jobs.

Revolution Wind, a $4 billion project, had already installed 45 of its 65 turbines and was on track to become the first commercial-scale offshore wind farm in Rhode Island and Connecticut [1]. The project was expected to power more than 350,000 homes and reduce over one million metric tons of carbon emissions annually [2]. It was also aligned with the states’ ambitious climate goals, including Rhode Island’s 100% renewable target by 2033 and Connecticut’s zero-carbon electricity grid by 2040 [2]. The project had already secured 20-year power-purchase agreements with local utilities in 2019.

State officials have strongly condemned the decision. Connecticut Governor Ned Lamont and Rhode Island Governor Daniel McKee called the order arbitrary and politically motivated, warning it threatens hundreds of jobs and delays clean energy progress [2]. Senator Richard Blumenthal stated that the decision “defies all logic and reason,” noting the project had already employed hundreds of skilled tradespeople [2]. Senator Chris Murphy accused the administration of favoring the oil and gas industry and hinted at corruption, vowing to pursue legal options to restart the project [2].

Industry and environmental leaders have also criticized the move. The National Ocean Industries Association, which supports offshore wind, gas, and oil, noted that the U.S. currently has only one large-scale offshore wind project in operation and stressed the need for diverse energy sources [2]. The Natural Resources Defense Council called the decision “misguided,” stating it harms energy security and raises costs for American families [2]. Meanwhile, Green Oceans, a nonprofit that opposes offshore wind, supported the BOEM decision, claiming it protects the fragile ocean environment [2].

Ørsted has confirmed it is complying with the order and has taken steps to ensure worker safety and environmental protections [2]. The company had recently raised $9.4 billion through a rights offering amid investor concerns over the administration’s anti-renewable energy stance [2]. The project was expected to be fully operational in 2025, but with construction halted, its future is now in question.

The decision adds to a pattern of regulatory uncertainty under the Trump administration, which has increasingly scrutinized offshore wind developments. This is the second major offshore wind project to be halted, following the temporary stop-work order on Empire Wind off the coast of New York [2]. The lack of a clear and consistent energy policy has raised concerns among developers about the long-term viability of large-scale clean energy projects in the U.S.

EU Green Deal obligations must be supported by economic incentives and capacity building to facilitate Asia’s green transition.","The European Union and the Asia Pacific are pivotal in tackling climate change, together accounting for almost 70 per cent of global emissions. The regions’ combined strengths and expanding climate and energy partnerships (CEPs) create opportunities to advance common environmental objectives, deepen and diversify international cooperation and accelerate the green transition.

CEPs are essential for driving decarbonisation, bridging climate finance gaps, expanding clean energy systems and promoting sustainable development. But upgrading their scale, scope and stringency, sustained political commitment and the coupling of obligations with incentives are needed to meaningfully translate ambition into action.

The European Union is spearheading the green transition. Emissions decreased almost 37 per cent since 1990. Renewable generation has nearly tripled since 2004 and now represents almost half of electricity. Domestic transformation increasingly coincides with external environmental cooperation — CEPs promote the EU green agenda abroad, and environmental objectives are embedded into trade and strategic arrangements, alongside sustainability due diligence, deforestation and carbon border adjustment instruments.

CEPs are critical for the Asia Pacific, which is responsible for an increasing share of emissions and dangerously exposed to climate change. Coal accounts for 57 per cent of electricity, production surged 202 per cent since 2000, and the region hosts three quarters of coal plants. Extreme weather affected 48 million people and drove losses of US$35.6 billion in 2021. Air pollution causes 4.5 million premature deaths annually, 70 per cent of the global total.

The European Union and the Asia Pacific have complementary strengths. The EU Green Deal offers diverse climate policy tools. The European Union is the largest contributor to climate finance, which has almost tripled since 2013, and has a longstanding record in tackling climate change domestically and internationally. The ‘Brussels effect’ uses market and regulatory power to raise global environmental standards.

The Asia Pacific is the world’s growth engine and industrial powerhouse. The region hosts three in four STEM graduates worldwide. Its share of the global economy and manufacturing has nearly doubled since the 1990s. Average infrastructural investment in emerging Asia is seven times the OECD average. ASEAN environmental integration is deepening, and the number of trade agreements in the region has leapt from eight to almost 150 since 2000.

Brussels increasingly integrates sustainability into its trade policies. 16 of 24 bilateral agreements with Asia Pacific countries contain Trade and Sustainable Development chapters. These are now systematically included in EU agreements, and increasingly contain stronger implementation measures and enforceable commitments. Two of the EU–ASEAN Strategic Partnership’s four pillars focus on climate and environmental sustainability. But deepening existing commitments, entering the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership and upgrading interregional platforms would improve effectiveness.

Since 2021, the European Union has developed targeted green cooperation instruments, including 37 Asia Pacific environmental partnerships, encompassing raw materials, green technologies, climate finance, development cooperation and green alliances.

Raw materials partnerships target critical minerals fuelling the green transition. Since the Critical Raw Materials Act in March 2023, Brussels has signed 10 of 14 existing partnerships, including with Australia, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. These agreements aim to meet rising demand, diversify supply and support climate goals. But stronger environmental safeguards and opportunities to move up the value chain are needed.

Hydrogen will prove essential to decarbonise hard-to-abate industrial sectors and facilitate energy storage. The EU has established hydrogen partnerships with Japan and Kazakhstan, to invest in joint research, co-develop infrastructure, set standards and harmonise regulations and manage supply chains.

The EU Global Gateway mobilises tailored development assistance towards the green transition, including Central Asian transport corridors and Pacific disaster risk resilience. But while programs like the US$11.7 billion for improving ASEAN energy markets reflect the scale of ambition required, others fall short.

Just Energy Transition Partnerships compensate the early retirement of coal plants and fund renewables. The Asia Pacific hosts two of four active JETPs, with US$20 billion pledged to Indonesia and US$15.8 billion to Vietnam. With just US$16 billion, Indonesia could meet its 2050 renewables target by 2030. However, contributions have been slow to materialise, with only 1 per cent pledged funds for Indonesia delivered by December 2024.

Green alliances provide frameworks for deepening environmental cooperation. The European Union has reached bilateral agreements with Japan and South Korea and an interregional Green-Blue Alliance for the Pacific. These advance common sustainability priorities, build capacity and coherence and align socioeconomic and environmental objectives. But further attention is needed to operationalise commitments.

Alongside the emerging Global Energy Transitions Forum and Clean Trade and Investment Partnerships, the expanding suite of CEPs holds considerable potential to advance the green transition. By combining EU financial resources and regulatory strengths with the Asia Pacific’s industrial capacity, infrastructural heft and skills base, CEPs can unlock synergies and allow both regions to advance their climate ambitions.

Yet immediate pressures like debt repayments in Asia and security concerns in the EU risk diverting attention and resources away from climate. EU Green Deal obligations must be supported by economic incentives and capacity building to facilitate Asia’s green transition.

CEPs should strategically target highest-impact areas where environmental and socioeconomic goals align, like carbon market development and cross-border energy infrastructure. Broadening CEPs’ scope to prioritise interregional fora and bridging formulation with implementation will prove key. By translating shared ambition into more concrete action through CEPs, the European Union and Asia Pacific can deepen environmental cooperation and make tangible progress towards a greener future.

New technology from Germany's Fraunhofer Institute for Manufacturing Technology and Advanced Materials has enabled an innovative measuring technique that can support these powerful batteries, as Interesting Engineering reported recently.

The technology relies on impedance spectroscopy. Impedance spectroscopy allows scientists to study electrical materials by measuring their resistance to current, or impedance, at a variety of frequencies.

According to Interesting Engineering, the new technology can detect heat early enough to shut down batteries and avoid damage. It can also improve EV charging by optimizing for slower or faster charging based on the length of the charge session.

Older versions of impedance spectroscopy were only possible while batteries were at rest. With the Fraunhofer Institute's innovation, batteries can now be examined while in use, saving time and offering crucial data about the battery's health and performance, while taking measurements at up to a million times per second.

Hermann Pleteit, the project's lead, said, ""[D]ynamic impedance spectroscopy opens up new possibilities for optimizing battery management, thereby extending the batteries' lifespan. It also paves the way for these batteries to be used in safety-critical applications.""

Improved batteries in EVs can help reduce harmful pollution from gas-burning vehicles. Although the EV manufacturing process can be energy-intensive, MIT Climate Portal has reported that EVs are responsible for much less pollution over their lifetimes than traditional vehicles.

Stronger, more reliable, and longer-lasting batteries also help build energy storage capabilities. When combined with renewable energy sources such as wind or solar, better energy storage can ensure a secure grid powered by clean energy.

Bundling solar energy with battery technology has proven an effective strategy for keeping energy running at home. In Puerto Rico, this combination has helped to take some burden off the grid or to provide power in peak summer heat.

The researchers noted that the enhanced ability to analyze battery health is not restricted to lithium-ion batteries. Other battery types, like sodium-ion and lithium-sulfur batteries, can also benefit from their innovation.

Danish wind farm developer Orsted says the Revolution Wind project is about 80% complete, with 45 out of its 65 turbines already installed.

Despite that progress — and the fact that the project had cleared years of federal and state reviews — the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management issued the order Friday, saying the federal government needs to review the project and “address concerns related to the protection of national security interests of the United States.”

It did not specify what the national security concerns are.

President Donald Trump has made sweeping strides to prioritize fossil fuels and hinder renewable energy projects. Trump recently called wind and solar power “THE SCAM OF THE CENTURY!” in a social media post and vowed not to approve wind or “farmer destroying Solar” projects. “The days of stupidity are over in the USA!!!” he wrote on his Truth Social site this week.

Scientists across the globe agree that nations need to rapidly embrace renewable energy to stave off the worst effects of climate change, including extreme heat and drought; larger, more intense wildfires and supercharged hurricanes, typhoons and rainstorms that lead to catastrophic flooding.

Rhode Island Gov. Dan McKee criticized the stop-work order and said he and Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont “will pursue every avenue to reverse the decision to halt work on Revolution Wind” in a post on X. Both governors are Democrats.

Construction on Revolution Wind began in 2023, and the project was expected to be fully operational next year. Orsted says it is evaluating the financial impact of stopping construction and is considering legal proceedings.

Revolution Wind is located more than 15 miles (24 kilometers) south of the Rhode Island coast, 32 miles (51 kilometers) southeast of the Connecticut coast and 12 miles (19 kilometers) southwest of Martha’s Vineyard. Rhode Island is already home to one offshore wind farm, the five-turbine Block Island Wind Farm.

Revolution Wind was expected to be Rhode Island and Connecticut’s first commercial-scale offshore wind farm, capable of powering more than 350,000 homes. The densely populated states have minimal space available for land-based energy projects, which is why the offshore wind project is considered crucial for the states to meet their climate goals.

“This arbitrary decision defies all logic and reason — Revolution Wind’s project was already well underway and employed hundreds of skilled tradesmen and women. This is a major setback for a critical project in Connecticut, and I will fight it,” Connecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat, said in a statement.

Wind power is the largest source of renewable energy in the U.S. and provides about 10% of the electricity generated in the nation.

“Today, the U.S. has only one fully operational large-scale offshore wind project producing power. That is not enough to meet America’s rising energy needs. We need more energy of all types, including oil and gas, wind, and new and emerging technologies,” said Erik Milito, president of the National Ocean Industries Association, a group that supports offshore oil, gas and wind.

Green Oceans, a nonprofit that opposes the offshore wind industry, applauded the BOEM’s decision. “We are grateful that the Trump Administration and the federal government are taking meaningful action to preserve the fragile ocean environment off the coasts of Rhode Island and Massachusetts,” the nonprofit said in a statement.

This is the second major offshore wind project the White House has halted. Work was stopped on Empire Wind, a New York offshore wind project, but construction was allowed to resume after New York Sen. Chuck Schumer and Gov. Kathy Hochul, both Democrats, intervened.

“This administration has it exactly backwards. It’s trying to prop up clunky, polluting coal plants while doing all it can to halt the fastest growing energy sources of the future – solar and wind power,” said Kit Kennedy, managing director for the power division at Natural Resources Defense Council, in a statement. “Unfortunately, every American is paying the price for these misguided decisions.”

Offshore construction on Revolution Wind started last year, following the final federal approval from BOEM. Currently, the project is nearing completion with all offshore foundations and 45 out of 65 wind turbines installed.

According to a Notice to Mariners issued on 18 August, Bokalift 2 and supporting vessels were scheduled to arrive at the site on or around 22 August for offshore substation installation, with the vessel White Marlin transporting the topside to the site. The AIS data available online shows Bokalift 2 is currently anchored at Jamestown Port but White Marlin is shown as sailing towards the project site.

In the order halting all ongoing Revolution Wind-related activities on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS), issued on 22 August, BOEM’s Acting Director states that this would allow time for BOEM “to address concerns that have arisen during the review that the Department is undertaking pursuant to the President’s Memorandum of January 20, 2025”.

According to the document, the Bureau is particularly focused on addressing “concerns related to the protection of national security interests of the United States and prevention of interference with reasonable uses of the exclusive economic zone, the high seas, and the territorial seas”, as described in the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OCSLA).

Following the stop-work order, Ørsted said its subsidiary Revolution Wind LLC, a 50/50 joint venture with Skyborn Renewables, was complying with the order and taking appropriate steps to stop offshore activities, ensuring the safety of workers and the environment.

“Ørsted is evaluating all options to resolve the matter expeditiously. This includes engagement with relevant permitting agencies for any necessary clarification or resolution as well as through potential legal proceedings, with the aim being to proceed with continued project construction towards COD in the second half of 2026”, the company said in a press release published on 23 August (CEST time).

The developer also highlighted that Revolution Wind was a fully permitted project, having secured all required federal and state permits “including its Construction and Operations Plan approval letter on 17 November 2023 following reviews that began more than nine years ago“.

“Ørsted is investing into American energy generation, grid upgrades, port infrastructure, and a supply chain, including US shipbuilding and manufacturing extending to more than 40 states. Revolution Wind is already employing hundreds of local union workers supporting both on and offshore construction activities. Ørsted’s US offshore wind projects have totalled approximately 4 million labour union hours to date, 2 million of which are with Revolution Wind”, the developer said.

The company also pointed out that its fully operational South Fork Wind, which is adjacent to Revolution Wind and uses the same wind turbine technology, delivered energy to New York at a capacity factor of 53 per cent for the first half of 2025, on par with the state’s baseload power sources.

The 704 MW Revolution Wind, which will comprise 65 Siemens Gamesa SG 11.0-200 DD wind turbines, has 20-year power purchase agreements (PPAs) to deliver 400 MW of electricity to Rhode Island and 304 MW to Connecticut.

The move from the US Department of the Interior sparked backlash from the industry for the second time this year because of a stop-work order for a project in construction, following the same decision made for Equinor’s Empire Wind 1 earlier this year.

The order for Empire Wind 1 was rescinded around a month after it was issued, following discussions between the New York Governor and the White House, which reportedly led to a compromise where New York Governor agreed to revise a previous decision on new gas pipeline capacity.

The renewable energy industry in the US has called the stop-work order for Revolution Wind “unlawful” and a product of “extreme partisan politics”.

“For the second time, the Trump Administration has taken unlawful action against a fully permitted offshore wind project under active construction—this time one that is nearly 80% complete”, said Liz Burdock, CEO of Oceantic Network.

“This dramatic action further erodes investor confidence in the U.S. market across all industries and undermines progress on shared national priorities—shipyard revitalization, steel and port investments, and energy dominance. In fact, halting work on Revolution Wind will drive up energy costs for consumers, idle Gulf Coast vessel operators that have invested hundreds of millions of dollars in new or retrofitted vessels, and jeopardize the livelihoods of union workers.”

Oceantic Network urged the Department of the Interior “to reverse course immediately” and allow the 704 MW offshore wind project to move forward.

CEO of American Clean Power Association (ACP), Jason Grumet, said stopping construction when the offshore wind farm is 80 per cent complete, was more than a bureaucratic delay. “[It’s] a broken promise to the communities, workers, consumers, and businesses counting on this project.”

“This is not the first time extreme partisan politics has derailed sound energy policy. The unfortunate message to investors is clear: the U.S. is no longer a reliable place for long-term energy investments”, Jason Grumet said.

“Here again, the Trump Administration is raising alarms about rising energy prices while blocking new supply from reaching the grid. Taking jobs away from American families while raising their energy bills is not leadership. American workers and consumers deserve better.”

The New Mexico Economic Development Department recently signed a memorandum of understanding with Pacific Fusion. This means the energy company will pursue plans to develop a research and development center in Albuquerque.

New Mexico is primed for a surge in clean energy projects, particularly fusion energy, if the project is successful. Breakthroughs in this technology have already been made by Sandia National Laboratories, which is based in the state. Pacific Fusion is building off the lab's innovations.

""New Mexico is a natural fit for this project,"" Keith LeChien, co-founder and chief technology officer at Pacific Fusion, told OK Energy Today. ""The Z Machine at Sandia National Laboratories helped lay the foundation for our approach, and the state's legacy of applied physics innovation, deep talent pool, and business-friendly environment put it in a unique position to become a national leader in fusion energy innovation.""

Fusion is the process of combining two atomic nuclei and harnessing the energy released from the process. This is similar to how the sun and stars work. A pickup truck filled with fusion energy is equivalent to 10 million barrels of oil, according to the Department of Energy.

Fusion has the potential to provide virtually limitless energy without contributing to air pollution like fossil fuels. Dirty energy can put people at higher risk for issues with cognitive functioning, respiratory problems, or fatty liver disease.

Alongside solar and wind, fusion is a promising source of alternative energy as the world seeks cleaner sources to combat climate change. It can solve the problem of rising energy costs and low supply due to unstable power grids.

Pacific Fusion's continued work puts New Mexico closer to delivering carbon-free electricity to the grid. It could also help stimulate the local economy. Once the deal is finalized, the new facility will bring an estimated $1 billion investment and 200 permanent jobs to the area.

""New Mexico is on the brink of an economic development surge that will demand more energy than ever,"" state Sen. Michael Padilla told OK Energy Today.

In April, the Interior Department halted work on an offshore wind project near the coast of Long Island.","The Trump administration has ordered companies to stop construction of a wind farm that's being built off the coast of Rhode Island.

The acting director of the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Matthew Giacona, wrote in a letter to one of the developers, a Danish firm called Ørsted, that the government was halting work on the almost-finished project in order to ""address concerns related to the protection of national security interests of the United States."" The project is also being developed by Global Infrastructure Partners.

The order to stop work on the Revolution Wind project is the latest move by the Trump administration targeting the country's renewable energy industry. President Trump, a longtime critic of the wind industry, in January issued a moratorium on new development of offshore wind projects. The Internal Revenue Service recently put out new guidance that makes it harder for companies building wind and solar projects to qualify for federal tax incentives. And the Commerce Department is investigating whether imports of wind turbines and their components threaten national security.

Ørsted said in a statement that it is ""evaluating all options to resolve the matter expeditiously,"" including legal action.

Revolution Wind is located in federal waters 15 miles south of Rhode Island. Construction started in 2023, and the project has been slated to begin sending power to homes and businesses in Rhode Island and Connecticut starting next year.

""Any pause or uncertainty at this stage could ripple across jobs, contracts, and communities already benefiting from the project,"" Erik Milito, president of the National Ocean Industries Association, a trade group whose members include wind project developers as well as oil and gas companies, said in a statement.

""Today, the U.S. has only one fully operational large-scale offshore wind project producing power,"" Milito said. ""That is not enough to meet America's rising energy needs. We need more energy of all types, including oil and gas, wind, and new and emerging technologies.""

The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management didn't respond to messages seeking comment.

Industry analysts have said that limiting renewable energy development amid rising electricity demand threatens to drive up power prices across the country.

""This is not the first time extreme partisan politics has derailed sound energy policy,"" Jason Grumet, chief executive of American Clean Power, an industry group, said in a statement responding to the Trump administration's stop-work order to Revolution Wind. ""The unfortunate message to investors is clear: the U.S. is no longer a reliable place for long-term energy investments.""

In April, the Interior Department halted work on an offshore wind project near the coast of Long Island. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum wrote in a letter to the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management at the time that approval of the project, called Empire Wind, ""was rushed through by the prior administration without sufficient analysis.""

Construction on Empire Wind resumed in May when the Trump administration lifted the stop-work order. But the disruption was costly for the project's developer, a Norwegian company called Equinor. The firm recently cut the value of its investment by almost $1 billion, mainly because of ""the changes in regulations for future offshore wind projects in the U.S.,"" Torgrim Reitan, Equinor's chief financial officer, said on an earnings call in July.

""For the second time, the Trump Administration has taken unlawful action against a fully permitted offshore wind project under active construction — this time one that is nearly 80% complete,"" Liz Burdock, chief executive of the Oceantic Network, an advocacy group for offshore wind, said in a statement about the Revolution Wind project.

The project had been delayed due to unspecified reasons. Energy Transfer operates the facility, which is designed to liquefy and export natural gas.

Cheniere Energy Inc. (LNG) saw a modest increase in its stock price on August 19, rising by 0.20% with a trading volume of $0.31 billion, ranking 327th in market activity [1]. This gain was driven by the announcement of a long-term LNG sales and purchase agreement (SPA) with JERA, Japan's top importer. The agreement, announced on August 8, signals operational stability and aligns with Cheniere's strategy to secure offtake commitments amid shifting global demand. The SPA highlights Cheniere's ability to attract major buyers, reducing exposure to volatile spot markets through extended pricing and demand guarantees [1].

In parallel, the US Department of Energy granted Energy Transfer an extension to start exports from the Lake Charles LNG facility in Louisiana. The completion date has been pushed to December 2031, reflecting unspecified delays. The facility is designed to liquefy and export natural gas. This extension is a significant development for the US natural gas market, as it impacts regional export capacity and energy security [2].

Additionally, Italian energy firm Eni aims to produce around 120 million cubic feet per day (mmcfd) of natural gas from two new wells at Egypt’s Zohr field in the Mediterranean by November, according to a government official cited by Asharq Business on August 20. The additional drilling project is part of Eni’s agreement with the Petroleum Ministry to offset natural production decline and maintain output levels [2]. Meanwhile, US-based Apache Corporation announced plans to boost its natural gas production in Egypt by 70 mmcfd in Q4 2025, following the completion of new processing and infrastructure upgrades in the Western Desert [2].

These developments underscore the strategic importance of LNG and natural gas in the global energy market, as well as the ongoing efforts of major energy players to secure long-term supply agreements and stabilize production. Investors and financial professionals should closely monitor these trends and their potential impacts on the energy sector.

As global demand for clean energy accelerates, companies like Enphase Energy (NASDAQ: ENPH) face a dual challenge: capitalizing on long-term structural growth while navigating near-term headwinds from macroeconomic volatility and regulatory uncertainty. For investors, the question is whether ENPH is a speculative bet or a strategic long-term play in the evolving clean energy transition.

Enphase's Financial Resilience and Strategic Positioning

Enphase's Q2 2025 results underscore its ability to thrive in a competitive market. Revenue rose to $363.2 million, driven by 11% growth in Europe and 3% in the U.S., with record battery shipments of 190.9 MWh. The company's gross margins—46.9% GAAP and 48.6% non-GAAP—were bolstered by the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) incentives, which contributed 11.4% to its non-GAAP margin. However, excluding IRA benefits, margins fell to 37.2%, highlighting its reliance on U.S. policy tailwinds.

Enphase's product innovation is a key differentiator. The launch of the IQ Battery 10C, with 30% higher energy density and reduced installation costs, and the expansion of its IQ Balcony Solar Kit in Europe, demonstrate its focus on solving customer pain points. Meanwhile, its U.S.-manufactured microinverters—eligible for 45X tax credits—position it to benefit from domestic supply chain incentives.

Macro Risks and Opportunities

The renewable energy sector is highly sensitive to interest rates and inflation. In 2025, falling U.S. rates and subsiding inflation are expected to reduce financing costs for solar projects, potentially boosting demand. The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) notes that high rates in 2024 suppressed residential installations, but rate cuts in late 2024 have already signaled a recovery. For Enphase, this means improved affordability for its battery and solar storage solutions, which require upfront capital.

However, policy risks persist. While the IRA's tax credits have been extended beyond 2028, regulatory shifts—such as changes to net metering or interconnection delays—could dampen growth. Enphase's 11.4% margin boost from IRA benefits underscores its vulnerability to policy reversals. Similarly, reciprocal tariffs and rising battery import costs threaten short-term margins, though the company's domestic manufacturing strategy offers a buffer.

In Europe, the EU's 2030 renewable target of 42.5% and infrastructure investments under the REPowerEU Plan create tailwinds. Enphase's expansion into 18 new European markets, including Greece and Ireland, aligns with this momentum. Yet, the region's fragmented regulatory landscape and slower adoption of solar storage compared to the U.S. pose challenges.

Strategic vs. Speculative: A Balanced View

Enphase's financials and product pipeline suggest a strategic long-term play. Its strong free cash flow ($18.4 million in Q2), $1.53 billion in liquidity, and disciplined capital spending ($8.2 million in Q2) reflect operational discipline. Share repurchases of $30 million in Q2 further signal management's confidence in its valuation.

However, the stock's valuation metrics—pegged at 0.7x PEG ratio—hint at undervaluation relative to growth potential, but also expose it to volatility. The company's reliance on IRA incentives and its exposure to margin compression from R&D and SG&A costs (which totaled $128.6 million in Q2) require careful monitoring.

Investment Thesis

For investors with a 3–5 year horizon, Enphase offers a compelling mix of innovation and resilience. Its leadership in microinverters and solar storage, coupled with IRA-driven domestic production, positions it to benefit from the U.S. clean energy boom. The European expansion also diversifies its revenue base, mitigating regional risks.

Yet, the stock is not without risks. Policy shifts, margin pressures from tariffs, and macroeconomic volatility could weigh on short-term performance. A diversified portfolio approach—pairing ENPH with broader clean energy ETFs or less policy-dependent renewables—may balance these risks.

Conclusion

Enphase Energy is neither a pure speculative play nor a guaranteed long-term winner. It is a company navigating the dual forces of innovation and regulation in a sector defined by rapid change. For investors who can stomach near-term volatility and believe in the long-term trajectory of distributed energy, ENPH represents a strategic bet on the future of clean power. However, those seeking immediate returns may find the stock's exposure to macroeconomic and policy risks too unpredictable.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-23 20:01:42.664857

(RUN) shares on August 21, 2025, reflects a rare alignment of regulatory clarity, monetary policy recalibration, and sector-specific tailwinds. For investors, this move underscores a critical lesson: strategic entry points in high-growth renewables sectors emerge when shifting policy frameworks and macroeconomic dynamics create asymmetries in risk and reward.

Regulatory Tailwinds: Tax Credit Clarity Fuels Solar Optimism

The U.S. Treasury and IRS's revised guidelines for clean energy tax credits have been a game-changer for Sunrun. By maintaining eligibility for residential solar projects under existing rules—while imposing stricter criteria for larger-scale developments—the administration has effectively shielded Sunrun's core business model from overhangs. This clarity has unlocked cost reductions and accelerated deployment timelines, directly boosting the company's cash flow potential. Analysts at RBC and Wells Fargo have upgraded RUN to “Outperform,” citing improved project economics and a 59.9% gross margin as key differentiators.

The regulatory environment now favors distributed solar solutions, which Sunrun has mastered through its third-party ownership model. As the sector grapples with the Inflation Reduction Act's evolving implementation, Sunrun's agility in navigating tax incentives positions it as a beneficiary of policy-driven demand. This is not merely a short-term rally; it reflects a structural shift in how regulators are prioritizing residential decarbonization.

Monetary Policy: High Rates and the Paradox of Renewable Valuations

While the Federal Reserve's 5.33% federal funds rate—a 20-year high—typically deters capital-intensive sectors, the renewable energy market has shown resilience. A structural vector autoregressive (SVAR) analysis of U.S. data from 1990 to 2023 reveals that solar energy is the most sensitive to monetary policy shocks. Yet, Sunrun's stock has defied conventional wisdom, rising despite elevated borrowing costs. How?

The answer lies in the interplay between policy and market psychology. The Fed's restrictive stance has compressed valuations across many sectors, but renewables have retained their allure due to their dual role as climate solutions and long-term infrastructure plays. Sunrun's debt-to-equity ratio of 0.3 and its focus on high-margin residential projects mitigate the drag of high rates. Moreover, the market is pricing in a potential pivot by the Fed as inflation moderates—a pivot that could unlock further valuation expansion for renewables.

Strategic Entry Points: Balancing Risk and Reward

For investors, the current environment presents a unique inflection point. Sunrun's recent performance—driven by a 70% storage attachment rate and record Q2 revenue of $569.3 million—demonstrates its ability to scale profitably even in a high-rate environment. However, the stock's technical indicators (RSI at 72.21, MACD at 1.3187) suggest overbought conditions, signaling caution for short-term traders.

The key to a strategic entry lies in diversifying exposure across the renewable energy value chain. While Sunrun benefits from residential solar, broader sector gains—such as those seen in First Solar and Enphase Energy—highlight the importance of a basket approach. Investors should also monitor the Fed's inflation trajectory and the pace of global clean energy commitments (e.g., EU and China's solar expansion plans), which could amplify sector momentum.

Investment Advice: Positioning for the Energy Transition

Hedge Against Rate Volatility: Allocate a portion of your portfolio to high-quality renewables with strong balance sheets (like Sunrun) while hedging against interest rate swings via short-duration bonds or rate-sensitive ETFs.

Leverage Policy Catalysts: Watch for upcoming updates to the Inflation Reduction Act's implementation and state-level clean energy mandates, which could drive further demand for residential solar.

Technical and Fundamental Alignment: Use Sunrun's current overbought RSI as a signal to take partial profits, but maintain a core position given its long-term growth drivers.

Conclusion: A New Paradigm for Renewable Investing

Sunrun's stock rally is not an isolated event but a symptom of a broader shift. As monetary policy tightens and regulatory frameworks evolve, renewables are becoming both a hedge against inflation and a vehicle for long-term growth. For investors, the challenge is to identify companies like Sunrun that can navigate these dual forces—leveraging policy tailwinds while maintaining financial discipline. The energy transition is no longer a distant horizon; it is a present-day opportunity, and those who act with clarity and foresight will be well-positioned to capitalize on it.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-23 20:01:46.198235

One vehicle stands as the cheapest of the bunch, though, as Nissan recently unveiled the pricing structure for the 2026 Leaf, and it's still the cheapest EV in America, retailing for less than $30,000, even without tax credits. As for the second most affordable EV? That would be the Fiat 500e, a battery-powered take on an old favorite of driving schools and rental fleets. If you're looking at price alone, the Leaf beats out the Fiat by a few hundred bucks, but is it actually the best deal on the EV market right now? Or is the 500e secretly punching above its weight class?

This May Be The Easiest Spec Comparison We've Ever Made

To take a quick look at the performance specs for these two cars...

With the Nissan Leaf, you're getting 174 hp and 254 lb-ft of torque in the base RWD S+ model. The higher trims, the SV+, and the Platinum+, will bump you up to 214 hp and 261 lb-ft of torque. The trade-off for that extra power is a few miles of range, with the S+ doing 303 miles, the SV+ doing 288 miles, and the Platinum+ coming in at 259 miles with a full battery. Note that the Leaf will also be available with a larger battery pack option, and we still have to wait and see how these numbers shake out across the lineup once the EPA gets its hands on the car.

Based on specs alone, it's not hard to pick a winner between these two models. The cheapest version of the Leaf has a 57-horse lead on the 500e. All Fiat 500e models come with the same 400v front-wheel drive electric motor and the same one-speed gearbox, so, unless you want to get in there and add some extra electric motors of your own, what you see is what you get.

The Fiat 500e's 149-mile range feels paltry in comparison to modern EVs, even if we keep it to the sub-$35,000 range. 149 miles is the EPA estimate, while Fiat says you might be able to get 162 miles out of a full charge. Even if we want to be nice and go with the Fiat estimate, that's still not great. In fact, if you're not familiar with the 500e's specs, you might find that number downright startling, like finding out that the Mitsubishi Mirage only makes 78 horsepower. There's no polite way to put it: these numbers just won't do in 2025.

In The 500e's Defense, It's Surprisingly Fun To Drive

The Fiat 500e feels a decade behind the times when it comes to performance specs, but when we get our hands on one of these cars for review, we're usually grateful for the experience. Test-driving the 2024 model, we called it a ""peppy little hatchback,"" with a lot of ""street-level charisma."" It's an adorable-looking car, too, calling to mind classic European city cars like the Mini Cooper, the Volkswagen Beetle, and any number of Citroëns, Renaults, and Peugeots. If you like micros and kei cars, this is about as close as you're going to get in an electric car that's been cleared for takeoff on American highways.

That being said, the Nissan Leaf is the superior car in every single category besides being adorable. In our prototype test-drive for the 2026 Leaf, we liked the effortless handling, and we found the car to be ""brisk,"" if not exactly sporty. You're not going to be winning any drag races, but you won't be hesitant to pass slowpokes on the highway, either.

Do we even have to say it? The Leaf wins round one.

The Fiat 500e Is A Charming Little City Car, But The Leaf Is Obviously More Versatile

In some ways, it's unfair to compare the Fiat 500e and the Nissan Leaf directly. The Leaf will get you at least 250-something miles on a single charge, and, depending on your options, weighs somewhere in the area of 3,500 lbs and makes for a comfortable drive on the highway. Meanwhile, the 500e weighs in at around 3,000 lbs, averages 162 miles of range on a single charge, if we're being generous, and is better suited to short trips and city living.

If your commute involves highway miles, if the trip to your favorite grocery store has you planning to be on the road for upwards of 20 minutes, we can flat out recommend the Leaf, hands-down. Where the Fiat 500e might have the advantage is in its nimble size, bringing to mind nothing so much as a Micro-Machine miniature. Let's check the basic physical dimensions of these cars...

Arguing the Fiat 500e's smaller size as a positive may sound like we're just looking for nice things to say about the car, but being able to make a three-point turn inside a broom closet isn't such a bad thing for someone who does most of their driving in the city. In some ways, it really is unfair to put these two cars head-to-head. For the vast majority of American drivers, the Leaf is the obvious winner, but it's not hard to see the appeal of the Fiat 500e for drivers who spend most of their road-time on busy city streets.

The Nissan Leaf Is Cheaper, Too

Comparing prices across both of these models, here's what we get...

Note that we're looking at 2026 pricing for the Leaf, and 2025 pricing for the Fiat... and it still shows the Nissan Leaf as the more affordable model for the base trim.

The Nissan Leaf is the clear winner in every category for this comparison, but it might make more sense to compare the Leaf to, say, the Equinox EV, selling for $33,600 for the 2025 model year, with a starting power output of 213 hp, and an estimated range of 319 miles. Or the Mustang Mach-E, selling for $36,495 with a 264-hp powertrain and 250 miles of range in the base model.

The Leaf is definitely a bargain at an MSRP below $30,000, but that doesn't mean it's the only great cheap EV out there.",https://static0.carbuzzimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/nissan-leaf-fiat-500e-main.png,N,,2025-08-23 19:02:58.906439

July marked the fifth consecutive month of increasing new car values, confirming an ongoing shortage of used car supply relative to consumer demand. As recently as August 2024 used car prices have dropped 4.8% ($1,509).

The latest iSeeCars study analyzed 1.5 million 1- to 5-year-old used cars sold in July 2024 and July 2025 to identify used pricing trends, and found that while used car values continue to rise used electric car values are still falling, though their drop of 1.3% in July suggests used EV prices are finding stability after years of decline.

“Just as used electric vehicle prices are stabilizing, traditional used cars are going back up in value,” said iSeeCars Executive Analyst Karl Brauer. “The combination of high new car prices, plus concern over tariffs and their impact on future car values, is likely leading to increased near-term demand for both new and used vehicles.”

Used Car Prices: They Just Keep Climbing

What started in March as the first month of increasing used car prices in over 2.5 years has turned into a 5-month trend. Used car values have not only been rising, but rising by a higher percentage every month since March, until the rate of increase dropped slightly in July. But even the moderate 3.7% bump in July still translates to nearly a $1,200 increase in what consumers have to pay for the average 1- to 5-year-old used car.

“Consumer demand for used cars remains strong, outstripping supply and driving prices up for five months in a row,” said Brauer. “For buyers waiting to get a deal on used cars, it appears they waited too long if they didn’t buy before March.”

Used Electric Vehicle Prices: Finally Finding Their Footing?

Electric vehicle prices were falling by more than 24%, or over $8,700, a year ago, but in July they dropped just 1.3%, or $408. This is the smallest decline in used EV values in over two years, suggesting the market has finally found a balance between used electric car supply and consumer demand.

“It’s interesting to see electric vehicle prices stabilizing just as the tax incentives for new and used models are withdrawn,” said Brauer. “It’s likely we’ll see a last-minute increase in both new and used EV purchases before the incentives vanish, followed by a decline in sales and demand. That could cause a short-term drop in prices right after the incentives go away, but also a longer-term increase, as fewer EV sales will ultimately mean a lower supply and a likely increase in values.”

Which Brand Lost the Most Value? (Hint: Tesla)

When ranked by brands with the biggest used car price drops , Tesla tops the list with a 5.3% drop in value over the past year. Chevrolet, Chrysler, Dodge, and Nissan also lost value in the past 12 months, while every other brand gained value.

“With used electric vehicle prices still dropping and Tesla having the largest share of the used EV market, it’s not surprising to see that brand losing the most value,” said Brauer. “More surprising is Infiniti gaining the most value, followed by Land Rover. These brands have led in lost used car value in the past and likely benefitted the most from the reversal of overall used car pricing over the past five months.”

The Top 20 Used Models Seeing Increased Value

Luxury models from brands like BMW, Land Rover, and Porsche lead the list of used cars that have gained the most value over the past year. A few high-volume, low-cost cars, including the Chevrolet Trax and Kia Niro, also made the list, but premium models dominate the gains in used car prices.

“The preponderance of higher-priced used luxury models gaining value suggests many of the consumers driving up used car values are former new car buyers who have switched to the used car market and are willing to spend a fair bit of money to get the vehicle they want,” said Brauer.

Top 20 Used Cars With the Biggest Price Drops

Tesla holds the first three spots on the list of used cars losing the most value, with the Model S, Y, and X all losing more than 12% in value. Ford’s Explorer Hybrid and Jeep’s Gladiator follow in spots four and five, with all of the top five vehicles losing between $3,224 and $6,662 over the past year.

“Luxury models dominate the list of cars losing value too, showing the wider swings these vehicles suffer when they are in either high or low demand,” said Brauer.“

“The factors impacting used car values, including limited supply and concern over tariffs, makes predicting future pricing trends difficult,” said Brauer. “But the pullback in used car value increases last month suggests we may see some moderation in their growth for the remainder of 2025.”

By Parvaiz Bukhari / AFP, NEW DELHI

Non-fossil fuels now account for half of India’s installed energy capacity — years ahead of schedule — but the third-largest greenhouse gas polluter remains deeply reliant on coal for electricity generation.

“A landmark in India’s energy transition journey,” Indian Minister of Renewable Energy Pralhad Joshi sid after the world’s most populous nation released figures last month.

“Five years early,” he added, referring to India’s 2030 target under the Paris Agreement, and marking a step to the country’s stated goal of reaching net zero emissions by 2070.

However, while the 50 percent milestone is significant, climate expert Avantika Goswami said the figures — which refer only to potential energy production — tell just part of the story.

“Overall, actual generation from renewable sources is still quite low,” Goswami said from the New Delhi-based Centre for Science and Environment.

The reason is stark: Nearly three-quarters of electricity continues to come from heavily polluting coal-burning power plants.

The challenge becomes even more apparent when examining India’s continued dependence on coal. Far from decreasing its usage, the globe’s second-largest consumer of coal pushed up production of the dirty fossil fuel by five percent last year, mining 1 billion tonnes, according to the coal ministry.

“Coal remains crucial,” the Indian Ministry of Coal said.

The stance highlights the practical challenges of India’s energy transition. Coal is needed to fulfil power demands while storage capacity lags behind the surge in renewable sources of power.

“The coal sector remains a crucial contributor to India’s energy mix, powering over 74 percent of the country’s electricity and sustaining key industries like steel and cement,” the coal ministry said, celebrating what it dubbed “India’s coal boom.”

This reliance places India in a challenging position globally. The country ranks behind only China and the US for carbon emissions overall.

However, analysts point out that in a country of 1.4 billion people, per capita emissions are only one-third of the global average, according to official figures.

“Looking at India’s per capita emissions, the effort it is making, India is doing pretty well,” said activist Harjeet Singh, head of the Satat Sampada Climate Foundation.

India has set itself the daunting challenge of reducing emissions by 45 percent by 2030.

At the same time, electricity needs are expected to more than double by 2047, according to the country’s Center for Science and Environment.

Supplying some of that demand “is likely to be met by the addition of renewables”, Goswami said.

Half of India’s 484.8GW installed capacity is from non-fossil fuel sources.

The majority comes from solar, totaling 119GW — the third-largest level globally.

India is building one of the world’s largest solar and wind energy farms, spread over a desert the size of Singapore.

It is followed by hydro and wind, and also nuclear power — which makes up less than 2 percent of the total mix.

However, solar and wind create steady power only when the conditions are right, and India’s storage capacity is a meagre 505MWh — far lower than it can generate.

The storage bottleneck was not lost on the renewable energy minister.

Speaking at the inauguration of a battery storage systems plant in June, Joshi said India’s renewable energy potential was “growing fast” and “adding 25-30 GW every year.”

“But without storage, we will either waste that energy or fall back on coal when renewables dip,” he added.

Building storage based on batteries requires rare earth metals, with rival and neighbor China controlling 70 percent of the world’s supplies.

“We still remain dependent on China,” said Harjeet Singh, the climate activist.

Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi (王毅) was in New Delhi for talks on Tuesday, with the supply of rare earth metals on the agenda.

One solution India is considering is pump-hydro energy storage projects.

When wind and solar plants produce excess energy, water is pumped into high reservoirs. That stored energy can then be released to generate power when demand surges.

However, Goswami believes the transition to cleaner power requires a multi-pronged approach.

The transition to cleaner power must come from “emission intensity reduction” of often inefficient coal plants, combined with better integrated renewable energy in the grid that “will actually make the shift happen,” he said.",https://www.taipeitimes.com/images/2025/08/24/P09-250824-311.jpg,N,,2025-08-23 20:00:49.283454

The company earlier this month saw its shares plunge after announcing a $9.4 billion rights offering, citing investor concerns over President Trump’s opposition to wind power.
As a member of the New England electricity grid, power plants in Connecticut produce more electricity than Connecticut residents use each year.
The decision to stop the Revolution Wind project, which is 80 percent compete and has already been approved through exhaustive reviews by multiple federal agencies, has nothing to do with energy policy or energy prices.
“This arbitrary decision defies all logic and reason — Revolution Wind’s project was already well underway and employed hundreds of skilled tradesmen and women.","Revolution Wind, a $4 billion, 704-megawatt offshore wind farm under construction about 15 miles south of Rhode Island that is designed to power more than 350,000 homes, has been abruptly halted by the Trump administration.

A letter issued late Friday by the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management ordered work stopped, despite the project being more than 80% complete and promising both clean energy and economic benefits for southern New England.

Ørsted, the project’s lead developer, confirmed the directive Friday, saying it is “complying with the order and taking appropriate steps to stop offshore activities, ensuring the safety of workers and the environment,” while also evaluating regulatory and legal options to resolve the matter. The company earlier this month saw its shares plunge after announcing a $9.4 billion rights offering, citing investor concerns over President Trump’s opposition to wind power.

Dan Dolan, president of the New England Power Generators Association, called the move “deeply troubling,” warning that billions of dollars in nearly completed facilities are now at risk due to abrupt policy reversals.

The project, which has already seen a $4 billion investment, had foundations in place and 45 of 65 turbines installed in federal waters south of Rhode Island. It was projected to cut over one million metric tons of carbon pollution annually — the equivalent of taking 150,000 cars off the road.

Revolution Wind secured 20-year power-purchase agreements with local utilities in 2019 and was endorsed by both Rhode Island and Connecticut regulators as a cornerstone of their climate goals, supporting Rhode Island’s ambitious 100% renewable target by 2033 and Connecticut’s zero-carbon electricity grid by 2040. The project was seen as a major opportunity to expand offshore wind, diversify the region’s energy mix, reduce dependence on natural gas, and help stabilize New England’s historically volatile winter electricity prices.

Halting the completion of the project not only jeopardizes billions of dollars in nearly finished infrastructure but also puts hundreds of local jobs and critical progress toward regional clean energy goals at risk.

“New England needs forward momentum, not sudden stops that hurt both consumers and suppliers,” said Dolan, emphasizing that energy investments require policy certainty, market stability, and clear, consistent siting rules. “When projects like Revolution Wind have met every legal requirement, secured financing, and obtained a Capacity Supply Obligation, they should not face the rules being changed midstream,” he added, noting that such actions erode investor confidence and threaten long-term electric reliability.

He stressed that the region must continue building new energy infrastructure — whether conventional power plants, offshore wind, advanced nuclear, or other technologies — to meet growing demand.

The directive, issued in the letter from acting BOEM Director Matt Giacona, cited a January 20 memorandum signed by President Trump stating unspecified concerns related to “national security interests” and “prevention of the interference with reasonable uses of the exclusive economic zone, the high seas, and the territorial seas.”

Rejecting the Trump administration’s rationale, US Rep. Joe Courtney, D-2nd District, said he had been in contact Saturday with Ørsted’s leadership, his Connecticut and Rhode Island congressional colleagues, and representatives of the building trades.

“The claim by the administration that national security concerns have arisen is particularly galling, given that BOEM and the US Coast Guard meticulously analyzed the protection of US interests as part of the record of decision years ago,” Courtney said, noting that the review ensured that transit by Coast Guard vessels and US Navy warships would not be hindered by the placement of Revolution Wind turbines.

Courtney added that if the order is carried out, it would terminate the jobs of about 200 workers in the trades, among the industry’s suppliers, and from tugboat crews, while also canceling a critical expansion of energy capacity negotiated below the cost of current wind projects.

Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont and Rhode Island Gov. Daniel McKee condemned the Trump administration’s announcement.

“This political move … wastes years of state investment in renewable energy designed to diversify our energy supply and lower costs for families and businesses,” Lamont said.

McKee added, “This action puts hundreds of union jobs at risk … just steps away from powering more than 350,000 homes.”

Both governors said they are working together to reverse the decision and save the project.

As a member of the New England electricity grid, power plants in Connecticut produce more electricity than Connecticut residents use each year.

Broken down by energy type, 58% of the electricity produced in Connecticut comes from Natural Gas, while 37% is from nuclear power. However, 85.5% of the state’s greenhouse gas emissions from electricity are from Natural Gas.

Connecticut uses about 24.5% of the energy produced for the New England grid, while the power generators located in the Nutmeg state provide 41% of all the electricity consumed in New England.The average residential price of electricity per KWh in Connecticut is 30.11 cents, according to FindEnergy.com, ranking the state 50th in the nation. The average monthly residential electricity bill is $211.14, ranking the state 52nd.

US Sen. Chris Murphy said Trump’s order was an example of corruption by the Trump administration.

“When the oil industry showed up at Mar a Lago with a set of demands in exchange for a $1 billion of campaign support for Trump, this is what they were asking for: the destruction of clean energy in America. The decision to stop the Revolution Wind project, which is 80 percent compete and has already been approved through exhaustive reviews by multiple federal agencies, has nothing to do with energy policy or energy prices. This is a story of corruption, plain and simple. President Trump has sold our country out to big corporations with the oil and gas industry at the top of the list,” Murphy said. “I will work with my colleagues and Governor Lamont to pursue all legal paths to get this project back on track.”

US Sen. Richard Blumenthal also released a statement decrying the Trump administration’s decision.

“As Connecticut families’ electric bills skyrocket, the Trump Administration is canceling critical clean energy projects that would lower utility bills and have created good paying union jobs for our state’s workforce,” he said. “This arbitrary decision defies all logic and reason — Revolution Wind’s project was already well underway and employed hundreds of skilled tradesmen and women. This is a major setback for a critical project in Connecticut, and I will fight it.”

Addressing the ET World Leaders Forum 2025, PM Modi noted that research is a major pillar of the nation's progress.

He noted that while imported research may suffice for survival, it cannot fulfil India's aspirations.

He emphasised the need for urgency and a focused mindset in the field of research, highlighting that the government has worked swiftly to promote research and has continuously developed the necessary policies and platforms.

Pointing out that until 2014, India's automobile exports stood at approximately Rs 50,000 crore annually, PM Modi highlighted that today, India exports automobiles worth Rs 1.2 lakh crore in a year. He remarked that India has now begun exporting metro coaches, rail coaches, and rail locomotives.

'I want to tell you about another success of India. India is now going to export electric vehicles to 100 countries of the world. A very big program related to this is also being held after 2 days on August 26,' he said.

The Prime Minister emphasised that when the fundamentals of an economy are strong, its foundation is solid, then the impact is visible across all sectors. He recalled that he had discussed this in detail during his address on 15th August, and while he would not repeat those points, he stressed that the developments around and after Independence Day exemplify India's growth story. Shri Modi also highlighted that the latest data shows 22 lakh formal jobs were added to the EPFO database in the month of June 2025 alone--marking the highest ever for any single month.

PM Modi noted that India's retail inflation is at its lowest level since 2017, adding that India's foreign exchange reserves have reached an all-time high. The Prime Minister shared that in 2014, India's Solar PV Module Manufacturing Capacity was approximately 2.5 GW, and the latest figures show that this capacity has now reached the historic milestone of 100 GW.

He stated that Delhi Airport has joined the elite Hundred-Million-Plus Club of global airports with its annual passenger handling capacity now exceeds 100 million, placing it among only six airports worldwide in this exclusive group.

Underlining that a recent development has drawn significant attention--S&P Global Ratings has upgraded India's credit rating, the Prime Minister emphasized that such an upgrade has occurred after nearly two decades.

'India, through its resilience and strength, continues to be a source of global confidence. India, guided by the mantra of Reform, Perform, and Transform, is now in a position to help the world break free from the grip of slow growth,' he added.

PM Modi said India is not a nation that enjoys throwing pebbles into stagnant waters, but one that has the strength to redirect fast-flowing currents.

'India, which follows the mantra of Reform, Perform, Transform, is today in a position to take the world out of slow growth rate. We are not the people who sit on the banks of stagnant water and throw pebbles. We are the people who can turn the fast-flowing stream,' he said.

We will do everything we can to protect Rhode Island’s interests and help lower people’s energy bills,” said U.S.
Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha said without Revolution Wind, “our Act on Climate is dead in the water.","PROVIDENCE – Gov. Dan McKee and Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont, along with other Rhode Island officials, on Aug. 23 condemned a decision by the Trump administration to halt construction of Revolution Wind, the wind farm being built south of the Rhode Island coast.

In a statement, McKee said the stop-work order “undermines efforts to expand our energy supply, lower costs for families and businesses, and strengthen regional reliability. This action puts hundreds of union jobs at risk by halting a project that is 80% complete – just steps away from powering more than 350,000 homes in Rhode Island and Connecticut.”

Said McKee: “At a time when we should be moving forward with solutions for energy, jobs, and affordability, the Trump administration is choosing delay and disruption.”

McKee said construction of Revolution Wind, which began more than two years ago, was “key to Rhode Island’s economic development, energy security, and long-term affordability for our residents” and that he was working with Connecticut officials to pursue ""every avenue to reverse this decision.""

Connecticut governor: Move will drive up energy bills

In his own issued statement, Lamont said, “This political move by the Trump administration will drive up the cost of electricity bills and contradicts everything the administration has told us.”

The decision, Lamont said, “wastes years of state investment in renewable energy designed to diversify our energy supply and lower costs for families and businesses.”

The project, which was on track to be completed early next year, would have powered more than 350,000 homes across Connecticut and Rhode Island while creating good-paying, clean energy jobs, Lamont said – ”the very goals President Trump claims to support.”

“All of that is now at risk,” Lamont said.

In a letter sent Friday, Aug. 22, to Ørsted, the Danish company that is a partner on the joint venture developing the project, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management ordered a stop to all ongoing activities related to the 704-megawatt wind farm.

The bureau cited an executive order signed by Trump in January that aimed to rein in the expansion of offshore wind power in America.

At the time, industry experts believed the order would stop proposed projects from moving through the permitting process, but that it wouldn’t affect wind farms like Revolution Wind that were already under construction.

Reaction from RI's congressional delegation

Other public officials also weighed in on the Trump administration’s move.

Rhode Island's congressional delegation said in a joint statement: “We’re committed to ensuring Rhode Islanders have affordable electricity, but President Trump continues to recklessly increase energy prices.

""Halting this nearly completed project is unwarranted and unacceptable. We will do everything we can to protect Rhode Island’s interests and help lower people’s energy bills,” said U.S. Senators Jack Reed and Sheldon Whitehouse, along with U.S. Representatives Seth Magaziner and Gabe Amo.

Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha said without Revolution Wind, “our Act on Climate is dead in the water. With the significant investments made in this project already and its obvious benefit to our economy and climate, the Trump Administration’s attempt to halt it can only be characterized as bizarre.”",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/2bzOEzYX74PnOnJpAXNzAQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the-providence-journal/d52f3a7df33d9dbf9b08ab88748fdb88,N,,2025-08-23 21:59:13.227697

Sales data in 2025 consistently reflect a move toward EVs and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs). A May report from the United States Energy Information Administration (EIA) showed particularly strong EV sales growth in the luxury sector, with EVs capturing 23% of the total luxury car market in Q1.

At the same time, Tesla — which appeared to have the EV market locked down in recent years — has experienced its share of setbacks, both in terms of volatile sales and its public image. In May, auto news site Jalopnik crowned the Lucid Air the ""go-to"" Tesla Model S alternative.

The outlet observed that Tesla functionally squandered its entrenched foothold on the all-electric market, a marketwide issue that could dissuade first-timers from making their next car an EV. Thankfully, following the second-best sales month on record in July, analysts anticipate EV sales will ""soar"" in Q3.

The rate of EV adoption isn't just a bulwark against high emissions by gas-guzzling conventional cars — going electric is a massive money saver, particularly when combined with home solar. EnergySage is a service that provides free, vetted local quotes and allows customers to save up to $10,000 on new solar panel installations.

But while Tesla falters, Electrek noted that Lucid's offerings ""continue to get smarter and more advanced,"" most recently via an over-the-air (OTA) update to its Lucid Air, a competitor to Tesla's flagship Model S.

Slated to begin on July 30, the OTA update gave Lucid Air drivers access to two features, Hands-Free Drive Assist and Hands-Free Lane Change Assist, the latter of which still required the driver to engage their turn signal manually.

Broadly, Lucid's update is part of the automaker's focus on advanced driver-assistance systems, or ADAS.

Dr. Kay Stepper is Lucid's Vice President of ADAS and autonomous driving. In a press release, Stepper said July's update was part of the maker's ""roadmap to continue to deliver significantly more functionality to our owners in the future.""

""The addition of these features to Lucid's DreamDrive Pro offers a glimpse into the future that Lucid is building,"" Stepper explained of the brand's ""software-defined vehicles.""

As many countries invest heavily in renewable energy, in a bid to decrease dependence on oil, gas, and coal, many traditional energy jobs are disappearing.
Around 67.5 million people were working in the energy sector globally in 2023, with around 34.8 million jobs in the renewable energy sector and 32.6 million jobs in the fossil fuel industry.
Several transition policies already exist across the region, such as the ASEAN Plan of Action for Energy Cooperation (APAEC) 2026–2030, “Advancing Regional Cooperation in Ensuring Energy Security and Accelerating Decarbonisation for a Just and Inclusive Energy Transition”.

As many countries invest heavily in renewable energy, in a bid to decrease dependence on oil, gas, and coal, many traditional energy jobs are disappearing. However, the knowledge and experience that workers in this sector hold could be well-suited to new jobs in the renewable energy industry, so long as governments invest in a just transition.

According to the European Union definition, a “Just transition is the term used to describe the transition to a climate-neutral economy while securing the future and livelihoods of workers and their communities. A just transition to a climate-neutral economy provides and guarantees better and decent jobs, social protection, more training opportunities and greater job security for all workers affected by global warming and climate change policies.” Meanwhile, the International Labour Organisation (ILO) says a just transition means “greening the economy in a way that is as fair and inclusive as possible to everyone concerned, creating decent work opportunities and leaving no one behind.”

Workers are key to the functioning of the global energy network. Those employed in both the fossil fuel and renewable energy sectors have the skills and experience needed to ensure that consumers have access to stable supplies of power and heating. Around 67.5 million people were working in the energy sector globally in 2023, with around 34.8 million jobs in the renewable energy sector and 32.6 million jobs in the fossil fuel industry.

In 2015, the ILO published Just Transition Guidelines, which included measures such as labour market policies to create new decent jobs and limit job losses, skills development, mechanisms for social dialogue, guidance on policy coherence, occupational safety and health policies, and social protection policies to safeguard workers. In 2023, the agency adopted a resolution based on the guidelines.

In Southeast Asia, a region that continues to rely heavily on fossil fuels, some governments have begun to invest in large-scale renewable energy projects, in some cases with support from international donors. The coal mining industry employs approximately 180,000, 86,000, and 4,000 people in Indonesia, Vietnam and the Philippines, respectively, while many workers in Malaysia are employed in the liquefied natural gas industry.

As the countries gradually decrease their dependence on fossil fuels, it will be important to train workers to transition to work in renewable energy projects to help avoid increased unemployment. Several transition policies already exist across the region, such as the ASEAN Plan of Action for Energy Cooperation (APAEC) 2026–2030, “Advancing Regional Cooperation in Ensuring Energy Security and Accelerating Decarbonisation for a Just and Inclusive Energy Transition”.

The 2021 launch of the Just Energy Transition Partnership (JETP) at COP26, which provides $20 billion and $15.5 billion to Indonesia and Vietnam, respectively, to phase out fossil fuels and increase the contribution of renewables, also supports this aim. However, the implementation of these policies is less simple due to pushback from fossil fuel lobbies, as well as a lack of funding and political will.

In India, the world’s third-largest energy consumer, workers' unions are increasingly demanding a just transition as the government gradually begins to close the country’s coal mines and more renewable energy capacity is deployed. There are around 300,000 permanent and 500,000 contract workers currently employed in India’s coal industry, while over 1.4 million people depend on the industry for their livelihoods.

While some coal workers have found jobs in the renewable energy sector, trade unions have raised concerns about the safety standards and wages in certain industries. For example, workers in solar farms face threats such as snake bites and electric shocks in the field, and many are paid extremely low wages, at around $ 3.2 a day.

Meanwhile, in the European Union, there are 31 coal regions in 11 EU countries, with around 200,000 workers employed in coal mines and power plants. To manage the just transition of these workers, the EU has introduced the COALition initiative, which brings together researchers, policymakers, businesses, and communities in regional hubs to shape locally tailored solutions. The EU aims to establish a regional framework for a just transition to ensure that all member states can successfully shift to green without the worry of high unemployment and economic burden.

Panagiotis Grammelis, the research director at the Centre for Research and Technology Hellas in Greece, explained, “We are leaving the coal era and moving into the renewables era… We have common problems, common policy issues – and we want a common innovation model to address them.”

Several countries and regions of the world are establishing frameworks to support a just transition for workers in the energy sector. However, some regions are doing this in a more collaborative way than others. The success of these frameworks will come down to the effectiveness of implementation by individual state governments, but they could ultimately support a green transition, limit unemployment growth, and reduce training costs through the upskilling of workers.

The tech industry’s accelerating buildout of infrastructure to power artificial intelligence is rapidly turning an industry once lauded as “clean” and environmentally friendly into an air polluting, ecosystem destroying, water guzzling behemoth. Now, there’s an intensifying rift on the left about how to approach what was, until recently, a steadfast Democratic ally.

Progressives are now at a fork in the road with two very different options: a political reckoning with Silicon Valley or a rapprochement paid for with environmental havoc.

Some pundits and industry figures have counterintuitively argued that the proliferation of data centers to power AI is a good thing for the environment. The massive energy demand for training artificial intelligence will, in this telling, necessarily prompt a massive investment in clean energy and transmission infrastructure to meet that demand, thereby catalyzing a world-altering transition toward renewable energy. This argument, already suspect years ago, is entirely untenable now.

Following US President Donald Trump and company’s evisceration of the clean energy investments from the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), the narrow path of AI buildout being aligned with a green transition is now completely walled off. The choice now is whether the United States continues to aid and abet Silicon Valley’s environmental rampage or to fight it.

Even prior to Republicans torpedoing the IRA, AI electricity demand was growing faster than both renewable energy production and overall grid capacity. Without strong additionality regulations to require that new data centers be powered by the construction of new renewable energy generation, the AI boom will continue to increase consumption of fossil fuels.

Much of the increased energy demand was already being met by natural gas before the Republican spending package. It’s only going to get worse now. Without the clean energy tax credits, the advantages of incumbency that fossil fuels enjoy mean that the AI energy boom will further hook us on unsustainable resource consumption.

The firms building out AI infrastructure know this and often point to major investments in clean energy to protest characterizations of data centers as environmentally disastrous. But there are two major problems there. First, those investments may be in totally different locations than the actual data centers, meaning the centers are still consuming dirty energy. Second, and more importantly, at our present juncture in the climate crisis, we need to be actively decreasing our use of fossil fuels, not just containing increases in dirty energy production. (It’s worth noting that AI is also being used to enable more fossil fuel extraction.)

And the environmental destruction doesn’t stop there. The Trump White House recently moved to exempt data centers from environmental review under the National Environmental Policy Act, or NEPA, paving the way for tech companies to despoil local environments without a second thought, and limiting opportunities for the public to gain information about data centers’ environmental impacts.

Perhaps nothing captures the excesses of AI quite so clearly as its water usage. Despite some pundits glibly claiming that there’s actually tons of water to go around, data centers threaten to worsen already dire droughts. We’re already beginning to see this in arid places like Chile and the American Southwest.

The Colorado River’s mismanagement is the stuff of public policy legend at this point. Aquifers across the Western US are being depleted. People were not mulling the idea of partially rerouting the Mississippi River for giggles. There is, unequivocally, a water crisis unfolding. And those data centers are very, very thirsty. A single data center can use millions of gallons a day.

There are already more than 90 data centers in the Phoenix area alone. That’s hundreds of millions of gallons of water a day. Protesting that “there’s plenty of water” is not just detached from the drought-stricken reality, it’s dangerous.

Data centers are being built in arid places intentionally; the low humidity reduces the risk of corrosion for the processor stacks warehoused there. Fresh water supplies, when depleted, are not easily renewed. Devoting more of it to cooling GPUs means less for drinking, irrigation, fighting wildfires, bathing, and other essential uses.

And there isn’t a way to bring water to the arid environments to mitigate that, either. Some people point to desalination, but that isn’t tenable for multiple reasons. To start, most of these data centers tend to be inland, as the sea air has similar corrosive effects as humidity. That, in turn, means that even accepting desalination as a cure for water scarcity, data centers would require transporting massive quantities of that purified water over significant distances, which would require complex energy-and resource-consuming engineering projects unlikely to proceed within the hurry up and go of our AI bubblish moment. (Desalination also has its own serious environmental harms.)

At present, there is simply no way to have the scale of AI buildout that the United States is seeing without terrible environmental downsides. The only choice left is whether to get out of Silicon Valley’s way or whether to slow the industry’s pace.",https://therevolvingdoorproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/4821616136_d8af867f3b_b.jpg,N,,2025-08-24 10:04:15.309810

Retreating sea ice After increasing slightly during the first 35 years that satellite data was available, Antarctic sea ice cover plunged dramatically over the last decade.
That contraction has happened about three times faster in 10 years than the decline in Arctic sea ice over nearly 50.
Unlike sea ice, ice sheets and the ice shelves to which they are connected are on -- or supported by -- land.
""Unstoppable collapse of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet is one of the most concerning global tipping points,"" said Abram.","Abrupt and potentially irreversible changes in Antarctica driven by climate change could lift global oceans by meters and lead to ""catastrophic consequences for generations"", scientists warn.

More broadly, a state-of-knowledge review by a score of top experts revealed accelerating shifts across the region that are often both cause and effect of global warming, according to a study published in Nature.

""Antarctica is showing worrying signs of rapid change across its ice, ocean and ecosystems,"" lead author and Australian National University professor Nerilie Abram told AFP. ""Some of these abrupt changes will be difficult to stop.""

Shifts in different facets of Antarctica's climate system amplify each other and have accelerated the pace of warming globally as well, she said.

The study looked at evidence of abrupt change -- or ""regime shifts"" -- in sea ice, regional ocean currents, the continent's ice sheet and ice shelves, and marine life. It also examined how they interact.

Floating sea ice does not add to sea level when it melts. But its retreat does replace white surfaces that reflect almost all of the Sun's energy back into space with deep blue water, which absorbs the same amount instead.

Ninety percent of the heat generated by manmade global warming is soaked up by oceans.

Retreating sea ice

After increasing slightly during the first 35 years that satellite data was available, Antarctic sea ice cover plunged dramatically over the last decade.

Since 2014, sea ice has retreated on average 120 kilometers from the continent's shoreline. That contraction has happened about three times faster in 10 years than the decline in Arctic sea ice over nearly 50.

The ""overwhelming evidence of a regime shift in sea ice"" means that, on current trends, Antarctica could essentially become ice free in summer sooner than the Arctic, the study found.

This will speed up warming in the region and beyond, and could push some marine species toward extinction.

Over the last two years, for example, helpless emperor penguin chicks perished at multiple breeding grounds, drowning or freezing to death when sea ice gave way earlier than usual under their tiny feet.

Of five sites monitored in the Bellingshausen Sea region in 2023, all but one experienced a 100 percent loss of chicks, earlier research reported.

Unlike sea ice, ice sheets and the ice shelves to which they are connected are on -- or supported by -- land.

The world would need to heat up by five degrees Celsius compared with pre-industrial levels to melt the entire Antarctic ice sheet, which would lift global oceans an almost unimaginable 58 meters.

Point of no return

But global warming to date -- on average about 1.3C -- is fast approaching a threshold that would cause part of the ice sheet to generate at least three meters of sea level rise, flooding coastal areas inhabited today by hundreds of millions, the study said.

""Unstoppable collapse of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet is one of the most concerning global tipping points,"" said Abram.

""The evidence points to this being triggered at global warming well below 2C.""

Another potential risk is the collapse of the Antarctic Overturning Circulation, a system of ocean currents that distribute heat and nutrients within the the region and globally.

A ""rapid and substantial slowdown"" of the currents has already begun, and evidence from the previous interglacial period -- between two ice ages -- before our own, 125,000 years ago, points to an abrupt stagnation of the system under conditions similar to those seen today.

""This would lead to widespread climate and ecosystem impacts,"" ranging from an intensification of global warming to a decrease in the ocean's capacity to absorb CO2, the study reported.

Ultimately, the only way to slow down the interlocking changes is to stop adding more planet-warming gases into the atmosphere.

""The greenhouse gas emission decisions that we make over the coming decade or two will lock in how much ice we will lose and how quickly it will be lost,"" Abram said.

The electric Macan is not mechanically related to the gas-burning car and is quite a bit more expensive.

It's not perfect, but it's a great overall package that shows Porsche has learned a lot from building the Taycan.

You see a lot of Porsche Macans around the world, driven by people with expensive sunglasses and designer handbags. It is the cheapest way to enter the Porsche universe, and it blends excellent road manners with style and practicality, making it a global favorite.

But now that the combustion engine Macan is being phased out and replaced by a considerably more expensive pure electric model, does it have what it takes to maintain its popularity? Both flavors of Macan are still on sale today, and so far this year, and it’s the electric model that has proven more popular, even despite going electric (and potentially alienating part of its buyer pool) and hiking the price.

Even though the electric Macan is proving successful, Porsche isn't taking any chances and has confirmed that it's working on a new midsize combustion crossover. It will arrive in 2028, and it won't be called Macan.

While the Macan EV is more expensive than the ICE model, it’s also a better, more grown-up vehicle. The two are not mechanically related and the electric model rides on the VW Group’s Premium Platform Electric (PPE), which also underpins a couple of Audis. Thanks to this platform, it has a big 100-kilowatt-hour battery pack and offers big luxury car features such as rear-wheel steering.

This isn’t the first time we’ve tried the Macan, but now InsideEVs Editor-in-Chief Patrick George has spent more time with the car and had mostly positive things to say about it. His tester was a Macan 4 with a dual-motor powertrain providing 402 horsepower and 479 lb-ft of torque. That’s enough to send the Macan EV to 60 mph in 4.9 seconds and up to a top speed of 137 mph.

The Macan 4 has an EPA range rating of 308 miles, but that goes down to around if you get the larger RS spider-design 22-inch wheels like the ones on Patrick’s tester. Interestingly, when Out of Spec Reviews drove a Macan Turbo at 70 mph, it actually exceeded its 288-mile EPA claim by 2 miles on 22-inch wheels. Tom Moloughney got 343 miles in the base rear-wheel-drive Macan on 20-inch aero wheels, surpassing its 315-mile EPA range prediction by almost 10%.

With a starting price of $81,600, the all-wheel-drive Macan 4 is definitely expensive. Patrick’s tester had some options, so it cost $94,855, which is a lot for a Macan, no matter what powers it. Patrick missed one-pedal driving, which the Macan doesn’t really offer, and it could also do with a bit more drama when you’re going fast in one. But overall it works really well, it’s practical, it’s well built and it’s just a cohesive package. It really shows Porsche has gained experience making EVs, and in many areas, it feels like an improvement over the Taycan.

What's being done about clean energy upgrades in the U.S.?
EnergySage noted that in less than three years, the Inflation Reduction Act induced $422 billion in private-sector clean energy investments and helped create over 400,000 jobs.","A U.S. Department of Energy report raised questions about the Trump administration's push to put the country's renewable energy transition on the back burner.

What's happening?

The July Resource Adequacy Report ""recycled familiar, but flawed, talking points against renewable energy, warranting a closer look at the facts behind the rhetoric,"" EnergySage reported. The administration props up fossil fuels as a solution to meet rising demand spurred by the massive growth of artificial intelligence and data centers, saying that retiring old dirty energy sources over the next five years will create a shortfall without investment in firm baseload generation sources.

But the independent clean energy platform noted that solar power is the cheapest and most scalable source of energy, as it can take less than a year to build and connect a solar farm. The cost is $38-$78 per megawatt-hour compared to $48-$107 for gas power. Even if it takes 18 months to build a renewable system with battery storage, which is rare, that's far quicker than the 5-7 years for new gas capacity or 10-15 years for a new nuclear power plant.

Even China, notoriously reliant on coal power, gets 33% of its electricity from renewables, according to EnergySage. The United States gets 22%.

""The actions to undercut and terminate investments in research and development of new technologies are incredibly devastating to the ability of the United States to invent, demonstrate, scale, and deploy clean energy technologies,"" former White House adviser Kristina Costa told EnergySage. ""The rest of the world is not changing their investment plans to move toward cleaner sources of electricity — they are continuing apace. The difference is that we are going to be artificially left behind.""

Why is this important?

Noting the potential of solar power in states such as California and Arizona, Ember global electricity analyst Kostantsa Rangelova said: ""It's a national risk for the U.S. to lose out on being part of that global story.""

Solar is not just cheap for distributors; it's one of the best ways for homeowners to save money on energy costs. It also does not produce any planet-warming pollution, which is the cause of rapidly rising global temperatures — another factor in rising energy demand, as they are increasing air conditioning use across the globe.

Explore EnergySage's free tools to get estimates on a solar installation and compare quotes. The average person can get nearly $10,000 in incentives to offset the upfront cost, which is the main barrier to entry for home solar systems. EnergySage also has a mapping tool that shows the average cost of a solar setup by state as well as details on incentives.

These incentives, however, will expire after Dec. 31 since Congress passed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. To claim the 30% solar tax credit, homeowners should act fast.

""These actions show that the Trump administration is more focused on undoing the previous administration's legacy than prioritizing the country's long-term energy security and affordability,"" EnergySage stated. ""In doing so, they've created a dangerous situation for Americans by undermining some of the only electricity sources ready to meet rising demand today.""

What's being done about clean energy upgrades in the U.S.?

EnergySage noted that in less than three years, the Inflation Reduction Act induced $422 billion in private-sector clean energy investments and helped create over 400,000 jobs. But the Trump administration has taken ""the legs out from under that manufacturing renaissance,"" Costa said — contrary to its pledge to ""unleash"" the country's ""energy dominance.""

She added that customers, utilities, grid operators, and technical experts agree that the administration and its rhetoric do ""not have any resemblance to reality on the ground.""

""By stalling progress, the U.S. risks ceding its position as a global solar superpower to China — threatening not only its energy leadership, but also its economic competitiveness and national security in the decades ahead,"" EnergySage concluded.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/oVuAYozZmZTaxJp2MCjoCw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02ODk7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_cool_down_737/a1f6c1908cb39939ac807b59c6e5bbd0,N,,2025-08-23 23:59:32.503486

Just the $7,500 in new electric vehicle tax credit have cost the government more than $2 billion annually since the inception of the program.

When the tax credit after September 30, Tesla will have to sell the Model Y, Model 3, or any of its vehicles on their own merit. For now, EV sales in the US are up year-on-year thanks to buyers rushing to take advantage of the tax credit.

EV tax credit expiration date

The IRS has now changed its rules to allow those who pay for their new electric car in the current quarter to receive the $7,500 in tax credit that more often than not ends up as a down payment on a Model Y lease.

Previously, Tesla clarified that the buyer must take delivery by the September 30 deadline to take advantage of the tax credit subsidy. The IRS, however, has changed the language in section 30D of the One Big Beautiful Bill that mandates the end of the new EV tax credit subsidy to reflect that buyers can profit from the tax credit even after September 30.

""The credit will not be allowed for any vehicle acquired after September 30, 2025"" reads the amended section, which in government parlance means that even a small Model Y down payment or a trade done before the end of the quarter will qualify the buyer for the tax credit. In order to then claim it, the dealer will have to provide a time-of-sale report to the IRS on delivery, and the buyer will get the $7,500 subsidy even if their Model Y drives itself to their garage after September 30.

California EV tax credit replacement

Even after the federal EV tax credit expiration, states like California may pick up the slack and replace the program with local incentives. In June, the Governor of California Gavin Newsom signed Executive Order N-27-25 that recommended moving to state-funded EV and clean energy subsidies, compensating for their loss at a federal level.

The order intends to keep the Low Carbon Fuel Standard and give EV buyers rebates, vouchers, or another form of purchasing incentive that matches the expiring federal tax credit. The executive order says that the state will fund purchases of new or second-hand electric cars, as well as fleet electrification and charging infrastructure deployment.

How exactly will Newsom's clean vehicle tax credit replacement mandate compensate for the $7,500 federal outlay remains to be seen, but California's move may be a harbinger of things to come as both individual states and automakers like Tesla are now starting to think how to sell electric cars without government subsidies.",https://www.notebookcheck.net/fileadmin/Notebooks/News/_nc5/model-y-7-seat-1.jpg,N,,2025-08-23 17:02:41.795956

Former President Joe Biden’s “whole-of-government” embrace of climate action has turned into a wholesale attack on clean energy — with a growing number of agencies joining in.

Biden threaded his climate policy into the work of each government agency. And that kicked into higher gear after congressional Democrats opened federal coffers for clean energy developers through the Inflation Reduction Act.

Now, President Donald Trump is using the same overarching strategy to target the wind, solar and battery industries, making it the task of every agency to eliminate or redirect programs that benefit renewables.

“We will not approve wind or farmer destroying Solar,” Trump wrote Wednesday on Truth Social. “The days of stupidity are over in the USA!!!”

New examples pop up almost daily.

The administration on Thursday used its formidable powers to investigate global trade practices to upend cost projections for wind projects — a source of electricity Trump has repeatedly denigrated as unreliable, a bird killer and an eyesore. The Commerce Department launched a formal probe into whether imports of wind turbines and their components harm national security, a first step toward imposing new tariffs that would raise costs and further shake up the industry, Christa Marshall reports.

Earlier in the week, the Agriculture Department took on solar energy projects on farmland by scaling back a pair of programs that helped farmers install solar panels on their land.

“Our prime farmland should not be wasted and replaced with green new deal subsidized solar panels,” Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said in a Tuesday news release.

‘Climate religion’

And last month, the Transportation Department said it would formally recommend a 1.2-mile setback between wind turbines and any highway or railroad, citing potential obstruction of radio signals.

“Joe Biden and [former Transportation Secretary] Pete Buttigieg put climate religion ahead of safety — blatantly ignoring engineers who warned of the danger of constructing wind turbines near railroads and highways,” Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in a statement.

The Environmental Protection Agency, meanwhile, took on battery storage this week, slamming Democrats who support batteries and releasing guidelines that warn of fires and health impacts.

The Energy and Interior departments are on the front lines of Trump’s energy policy. The “whole-of-government” effort aligns other members of the Cabinet with the agenda, which spans climate and energy programs across the sprawling federal bureaucracy.

But the administration’s drumbeat of opposition to renewable energy also taps into the frustration about the large footprints of most projects. Farms, for instance, have long been prime real estate for solar energy, often to the dismay of neighbors.

Long Island, home to EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, is the site of a proposed 79-megawatt battery project that faces local opposition.

Zeldin, a former member of Congress and gubernatorial candidate, went there to announce EPA’s battery storage guidelines. He also took a few digs at his 2022 opponent, Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul.

When hurricanes and health care cuts collide

A Tennessee hospital damaged by Hurricane Helene last September is facing an uncertain future after Congress slashed over $1 trillion from health care programs and made it harder for people to get health insurance, Ariel Wittenberg writes.

Helene’s surging floodwaters forced people inside Unicoi County Hospital in northeastern Tennessee to evacuate by rooftop. The hospital offers one example of how rural hospitals are struggling financially as revenue sources stripped out by Congress face tightening budgets. Unicoi might not reopen, leaving the county without a hospital or emergency care.

“This is going to be a bloodbath if something isn’t changed,” said Ballad Health CEO Alan Levine, a Republican who led Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’ health care transition team. “The issue isn’t just about Unicoi and whether it reopens, it will be about how many hospitals we can even keep open.”

DOE gives coal plant another lifeline

Energy Secretary Chris Wright extended an emergency order keeping a Michigan coal plant open Thursday, leaning on Trump’s policy to expand fossil fuel generation across the grid as it faces rising demand, Peter Behr writes.

“With electricity demand increasing, we must put an end to the dangerous energy subtraction policies embraced by politicians for too long,” Wright said.

In the order to keep the J.H. Campbell plant operating well past its intended closure, Wright on Thursday nodded to Trump’s antipathy toward renewable power. But electricity experts say Wright risks ignoring the full range of stresses the grid faces, issues that can’t be solved just by keeping old coal plants running.

Grids serving Texas and huge swaths of the middle of the country use significant amounts of renewable energy to keep the lights on, with utilities and big technology companies building or purchasing more. California has installed large amounts of energy storage to enable its supply of renewable power.

Not getting any cooler outside

The World Health Organization called on workplaces to create heat policies to protect workers from dangerous conditions, Rory O’Neill writes.

In a report and guidance on heat policies, the international organization noted workers are the largest group vulnerable to climate change. Nearly every sector is affected by extreme heat, with outdoor workers and first responders especially at risk.

After the hottest year on record in 2024, extreme heat is “for many, a case of adapt or die,” said Johan Stander of the World Meteorological Organization.

The idea is not just to protect the planet, but also to save a bit because keeping those plants running costs the state too much.
Every shutdown opens a door This isn’t just about shutting down power plants, it’s about making space for what’s coming.
It’s clean, efficient, and it’s already here.
And the United States wants, as always, to lead the clean energy revolution!","No one would have ever imagined it, but yes, it’s over. The United States has disconnected 12.3 gigawatts of energy capacity. Just like that. Plants that had been running for decades… And supplying a large part of the population. Some coal, some gas. Even some nuclear. All gone! And the thing is, this plant was key to keeping the country running… And now there’s no turning back. What is happening to our country? And above all… is there no turning back?

The Department of Energy and the EIA have been warning about it for a while, they want fewer emissions, less smoke, less noise. And more clean energy. The idea is not just to protect the planet, but also to save a bit because keeping those plants running costs the state too much.

Goodbye, coal, finally!

Yes, all of this comes because the EIA and the DOE want to move toward a more ecological vision, and coal isn’t exactly the best ally. We’ve been saying for years that this primary energy source is going to disappear… and it’s still here! And the thing is, we’ve been bombarded for decades with the transition to renewables but no one has done anything to gradually eliminate the use of coal… Until now. Now there really is no more, the numbers don’t add up. Environmental regulations are tightening, and climate change doesn’t give much room either.

What used to be seen as a symbol of progress is now a burden. No one wants to keep throwing money into plants that don’t perform when you see how renewable energies are evolving, so they’ve decided to say goodbye to these plants, and unfortunately it’s not just for ecology, but because they’re not profitable!

Are we running out of energy? Not at all

Let’s not exaggerate either, but removing 12.3 GW from the power system all at once will definitely be noticed, especially in places that used to rely on this power plant, but the energy doesn’t disappear, it will just start being generated from somewhere else and in another way.

Now there are many ways to produce clean energy, solar panels, wind turbines, modern batteries… Technologies that not so long ago seemed like something out of a movie. And now they’re here. States like California or Texas are already showing that it’s possible to live without coal and without missing the past!

Every shutdown opens a door

This isn’t just about shutting down power plants, it’s about making space for what’s coming. Engineering, research, investment… A new energy system that has nothing to do with burning coal. And that means building another one from scratch, quieter, cleaner, cheaper in the long term.

Some see it as a problem, but for us it’s an opportunity. We have to stop looking at the past to see that the future can start being better from the beginning!

What the U.S. does doesn’t stay in the U.S.

Even if this decision affects plants on U.S. soil, the message goes further. When a power like the United States makes such a clear decision, the rest of the world listens and has to take note.

This is not the end of anything. It’s the beginning

The shutdown of 12.3 GW marks the end of a stage, but every story that ends makes another begin, and that’s how it will be. What used to be a symbol of development is now just an old piece that was in the way, we have to make space for new generations, and the thing is, the energy of the future doesn’t smell like smoke, doesn’t make noise and doesn’t need excuses, just putting it into practice! It’s clean, efficient, and it’s already here. And the United States wants, as always, to lead the clean energy revolution!",https://unionrayo.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/US-energy.jpg,N,,2025-08-23 16:02:12.721806

The recent Department of Energy (DOE) extension for Energy Transfer's Lake Charles LNG project—pushing its completion deadline to December 31, 2031—highlights a broader trend: federal support for LNG infrastructure is accelerating the nation's energy independence while unlocking long-term value for investors. This move, coupled with market dynamics and geopolitical shifts, underscores why LNG is becoming a cornerstone of the U.S. energy strategy and a compelling investment opportunity.

Regulatory Tailwinds: A Catalyst for Growth

The Lake Charles LNG project, originally slated for completion in 2020, has faced delays due to the pandemic, evolving global demand, and ownership transitions. Yet, the DOE's latest extension reflects a deliberate policy shift to prioritize LNG exports. This aligns with the Trump administration's pro-energy agenda, which contrasts sharply with earlier regulatory hesitancy under the previous administration. By granting this extension, the DOE ensures the project remains authorized during construction, a critical factor for securing final investment decisions (FIDs) and long-term offtake agreements.

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has similarly played a role, with prior extensions in 2019 and 2028. These regulatory actions signal a unified effort to streamline approvals for LNG projects, reducing bureaucratic friction that once stifled development. For investors, this clarity is invaluable. Projects like Lake Charles, with a projected capacity of 2.33 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d), are now better positioned to capitalize on surging global demand, particularly in Asia and Europe, where energy security concerns are driving a shift away from Russian gas.

Market Dynamics: LNG as a Strategic Asset

The U.S. LNG market is poised for explosive growth. By 2035, the LNG bunkering market alone is projected to expand from $365.4 million in 2024 to $7.68 billion, driven by stricter environmental regulations and the adoption of LNG as a cleaner marine fuel. This growth is not speculative—it's being fueled by tangible infrastructure investments. For instance, TotalEnergies and Sempra Infrastructure are expanding their LNG bunkering capabilities, with TotalEnergies recently launching a terminal in Port Houston.

Investor sentiment is equally robust. The U.S. has become the world's largest LNG exporter, with projects in Louisiana and Texas accounting for 39.6% of global new export capacity under construction. This dominance is not accidental; it's the result of a regulatory environment that prioritizes energy production. The Lake Charles project, for example, has already secured long-term contracts with Chevron and Kyushu Electric, providing a stable revenue stream that enhances its investment appeal.

Case Studies: Regulatory Support Translates to Returns

Between 2020 and 2025, U.S. LNG projects have raised nearly $37 billion, with major FIDs secured for Louisiana LNG, CP2 LNG, and Cheniere's Corpus Christi expansion. These projects exemplify how regulatory clarity and market demand converge to generate returns. For instance, Venture Global's CP2 LNG project, which received FID in 2025, is projected to yield a 12% internal rate of return (IRR) over its 20-year lifespan, driven by long-term contracts with Asian buyers.

However, the regulatory landscape is not without risks. The DOE's 2024 pause on non-FTA export approvals initially caused uncertainty, but it also allowed for refined evaluation processes. This pause, while controversial, has not deterred investment—U.S. LNG developers raised $37 billion in 2025 alone, surpassing previous years. The key takeaway is that regulatory support, even when intermittent, creates a framework where projects can thrive once approvals are granted.

Strategic Implications for Investors

For investors, the Lake Charles LNG extension and broader regulatory trends present a dual opportunity: energy security and financial returns. The U.S. is leveraging LNG to reduce reliance on foreign oil and gas, a strategic imperative in an era of geopolitical volatility. At the same time, the sector's growth is underpinned by infrastructure development, competitive pricing, and contract flexibility. U.S. LNG's ability to redirect shipments—unlike fixed pipeline exports—makes it a preferred option for global buyers, enhancing its market resilience.

Investors should focus on companies with strong regulatory backing and diversified offtake agreements. Energy Transfer, which now owns Lake Charles LNG, and Cheniere Energy, with its Corpus Christi expansion, are prime examples. Additionally, infrastructure plays like Sempra Infrastructure, which is building new bunkering facilities, offer exposure to the sector's ancillary growth.

Conclusion: A Long-Term Play on Energy Independence

The DOE's extension for Lake Charles LNG is more than a bureaucratic adjustment—it's a strategic signal that the U.S. is doubling down on LNG as a pillar of its energy future. While regulatory pauses and environmental reviews introduce short-term volatility, the long-term outlook remains bullish. With global demand for cleaner energy surging and U.S. producers poised to fill supply gaps, LNG is not just a commodity—it's a geopolitical and economic lever. For investors, the message is clear: aligning with this sector offers a unique blend of strategic value and financial upside.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-23 16:03:24.334387

But despite all of these efforts, the industry has spiraled downward for decades, and some analysts say that the Trump team’s efforts will not be sufficient to reverse that trend.

Market realities facing coal

The U.S. Energy Information Administration said in April that U.S. coal production has declined over the past two decades. The United States in 2023 produced 578 million short tons of coal, less than half of the amount produced in 2008, when U.S. coal production peaked.

The decline is partly attributable to the imposition of environmental regulations. Most prominently, the Environmental Protection Agency under former Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden sought to impose rules to limit carbon and toxic emissions from coal-fired power plants. Republican opponents accused the Democrats of waging a “war on coal” and said that the restrictions would mean the shuttering of plants around the country.

The rules have been subject to a regulatory and legal tug-of-war. Obama’s rule on power plant emissions was stayed by the Supreme Court. The first Trump administration proposed a rule with dramatically lighter restrictions, but the D.C. Circuit Court found it illegal just before Biden entered office.

The Supreme Court limited the EPA’s authority to regulate carbon emissions in West Virginia v. EPA during the Biden administration, which later finalized a new rule to comply with the high court’s ruling that would have required coal plants to use carbon capture technologies to reduce their emissions by 90% by 2032.

Michelle Bloodworth, president and CEO of America’s Power, said, “The EPA regulations certainly under the Biden administration — they were really designed to shut down every coal plant in the United States.”

Now, the Trump EPA is taking action to repeal the rule.

Still, the regulatory actions against coal are only part of the story of its decline.

Scott Segal, cochairman of the Policy Resolution Group at Bracewell, told the Washington Examiner that economic factors have primarily driven the trend away from coal, noting that many of the toughest climate regulations were not fully implemented.

During the early 2000s, the development of fracking, a technology for cracking shale rock layers thousands of feet underground to obtain natural gas and oil, led to a boom in low-cost oil and natural gas. The Shale Revolution quickly made natural gas more competitive than coal.

“It’s not environmental law, but it’s more economic law,” Segal said. “The supply of natural gas went up. The cost of producing natural gas went down.”

“A single drilling pad could produce dozens of different wells … As a result, it became less expensive and more environmentally protective to produce natural gas. And those were market forces. Those were not forced by environmental regulation,” he added.

In July, EIA reported a price of $25.45 per megawatt-hour for natural gas at the Henry Hub in May 2025, while the cost of coal was $36.43 per megawatt-hour during the same period. Coal generated about 16.2% of U.S. electricity in 2023. Natural gas, in comparison, generated 43.1%, making it the single-largest source of power.

Brandon Dalling, an attorney at King & Spalding, said power producers will not spend capital to upgrade coal-fired plants unless they are guaranteed a long-term return on capital.

“In order to burn [coal], you need to keep spending a lot of money on your power plants to make sure that they are in tip-top shape to continue to burn coal, and that investment has not been as intensive in recent years,” he said.

Dalling said people have been more rewarded for investing in wind turbines, solar panels, battery storage, and gas-fired power plants.

“The market forces have resulted in coal plants shutting down, and less investment in coal,” he said.

Efforts to revamp coal

In April, Trump signed four executive orders aimed at revitalizing the coal industry. One of those executive orders, “Reinvigorating America’s Beautiful Clean Coal Industry,” invoked emergency powers to fast-track environmental reviews for coal-related projects. It also opened up public land for coal leasing and directed the Interior Department to designate coal as a “mineral,” allowing it to receive similar federal benefits as other minerals, including eased permitting and federal loans.

The other orders directed the Energy Department to identify and keep critical power generation online to address grid reliability troubles, such as coal. One exempted power plants from complying with the EPA mercury and toxics standards for two years. Lastly, the president directed the Justice Department to challenge state laws that targeted the use of coal.

The Energy Department has recently used emergency powers to keep the J.H. Campbell coal plant in Michigan and the Eddystone oil and gas plant in Pennsylvania from retiring, citing concerns of being unable to meet energy demands within the region. The Department of the Interior has also taken policy action to make coal more accessible by reducing regulatory barriers and reopening federal lands.

“The administration does not appear to be attempting to change the fundamental economics of the power system through these executive orders. These executive orders still cast a weather eye on emergency conditions and seek to address those emergency conditions,” Segal said.

In Congress, the Republicans’ One Big Beautiful Bill Act classified metallurgical coal, used in steel production, as a critical mineral, making it eligible for an advanced manufacturing production credit. The legislation also speeds up the review of coal lease applications and increases federal land leasing for coal.

Surging energy demand

Those in the industry argue that coal is needed to meet growing energy demand, which is increasing due to the rise of technologies such as databases and artificial intelligence.

Emily Arthun, CEO of the American Coal Council, told the Washington Examiner, “There has been a constant assault on the coal industry for several decades at this point, and I believe that policies have to be put in place to help this industry revive.”

“We have areas like in California that experience rolling brownouts and blackouts due to lack of resources for energy. And so it’s absolutely critical that we have this very important baseload energy source continuing to thrive in the United States just to meet our energy needs,” she said.

The DOE released a report in July that found that the U.S. will see peak hour energy supply demand rise by at least 100 gigawatts by 2030, with half of the demand attributed to data centers.

As energy demand grows, prices are also going up. Electricity prices increased by 5.5% for the year ending in July, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Consumer Price Index.

“We have been saying for the past three or four years that we are in the middle of an energy emergency,” Bloodworth said.

“We do feel like coal provides attributes that no other resource can replicate,” she continued. “One of those would be fuel security, 24/7 capacity, and it also can ramp up and down very quickly, especially during periods of extreme weather.”

In his first term, Trump attempted to revive the industry, including through proposals to boost payments to coal plants on the grounds that they produce reliable power, but failed to make any lasting changes.

This time, though, the White House created the Energy Dominance Council, led by Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, to coordinate among federal agencies on energy-related issues.

Bloodworth said the Trump administration’s creation of the council has made a “huge difference, even since the first Trump administration.”

Meanwhile, Ethan Tsai, project manager consultant at Rystad Energy, told the Washington Examiner he does not expect tremendous growth in the coal industry, but a decline in the retirement of coal plants.

“The truth of the matter is that coal’s still going to be around for at least another few decades. But the growth is not there. We’re going to be seeing a downward trend of coal within the grid space itself,” Tsai said.

CALIFORNIA GOP LAWMAKERS SUE AND STALL TO BLOCK NEW MAP FROM PASSING

The EIA told the Washington Examiner that 19.6 gigawatts of coal capacity were scheduled to retire by the end of 2024. As of the end of June, 105 gigawatts are still on track to retire within the same time frame, although nearly 8 gigawatts have had retirement schedule changes.

“As we’re seeing more and more natural gas power plants ramp up, more renewables ramp up, especially with AI and demand for data centers, and the spike in electricity demand, coal is going to take a smaller share of that entire supply,” Tsai added.",https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/AP25098745996827.jpg,N,,2025-08-23 17:02:12.670125

While BP's stock appears undervalued relative to intrinsic value models, its path to recovery hinges on credible climate resilience and ESG improvements.","In August 2025, BP's Whiting Refinery in Indiana faced a severe test of its operational resilience when torrential rains caused catastrophic flooding, temporarily shutting down one of the Midwest's largest refining hubs. The incident, while disruptive, offered a stark but instructive glimpse into how energy infrastructure must adapt to climate-driven volatility—and how crisis management strategies can shape investor perceptions in an era of escalating environmental risks.

Operational Resilience: From Emergency Response to Long-Term Adaptation

BP's immediate response to the flooding demonstrated a layered approach to risk mitigation. The refinery's emergency protocols included controlled shutdowns of processing units, emergency flaring to relieve pressure, and the deployment of containment booms to prevent water contamination. Specialized equipment was used to remove water from critical zones, while wastewater management systems—retention ponds, containment berms, and stormwater diversion—prevented discharges into natural waterways. These actions, combined with 24/7 coordination with regulators and local authorities, minimized environmental harm and ensured operational safety.

The refinery's phased restart, prioritizing system stability, underscored BP's commitment to operational continuity. By resuming full capacity within a week, the company mitigated regional fuel supply disruptions and stabilized markets. However, the incident also exposed vulnerabilities. The Whiting Refinery had already faced a six-month shutdown in 2024 due to a hydrogen leak and has incurred regulatory penalties in recent years. These recurring challenges have eroded refining margins and raised questions about the long-term viability of aging infrastructure in a climate of increasing extreme weather events.

Environmental Safeguards and Investor Sentiment

BP's environmental safeguards during the crisis were critical in managing reputational and regulatory risks. Air quality monitoring during flaring ensured emissions remained below harmful thresholds, while transparent communication with the public reinforced trust. Yet, these efforts were not enough to fully restore investor confidence.

BP's shares, trading at 419.5 GBX in August 2025, remained 70% below their estimated intrinsic value of 1,381.44 GBX, reflecting broader concerns about refining reliability and ESG performance. The company's underlying replacement cost (RC) profits had declined by 36% in 2024, and ESG downgrades from MSCI and Sustainalytics had increased financing costs. While BP's refining availability reached 96.4% in Q2 2025, the Whiting incident highlighted the fragility of its refining segment, particularly as diesel and jet fuel inventories remain low, squeezing margins.

Strategic Investments in Climate Resilience

BP's response to the 2025 crisis also revealed its long-term adaptation strategy. The refinery has invested in elevated electrical equipment, reinforced containment areas, and advanced weather monitoring systems with predictive modeling. These measures align with industry trends to harden infrastructure against climate risks. Additionally, BP's transformation of the Gelsenkirchen refinery to produce sustainable aviation fuel signals a pivot toward the energy transition, though such projects require sustained capital and operational discipline.

For investors, the key question is whether these investments will offset recurring operational risks. While BP has cut structural costs by $1.7 billion since 2023, its refining segment remains under pressure. shows BP trailing its peers, amplifying concerns about its ability to compete in a decarbonizing energy landscape.

Investment Implications and the Path Forward

The Whiting Refinery incident underscores a critical truth: in the energy transition era, resilience is not just about avoiding disasters but about demonstrating the capacity to recover swiftly and sustainably. For BP, this means balancing short-term operational reliability with long-term decarbonization goals.

Investors should monitor two key metrics:

1. Refining Availability Trends: Sustained improvements in uptime will signal progress in addressing infrastructure vulnerabilities.

2. Energy Transition Execution: Success in projects like Gelsenkirchen's sustainable aviation fuel conversion will determine BP's ability to align with net-zero targets.

While BP's stock appears undervalued relative to intrinsic value models, its path to recovery hinges on credible climate resilience and ESG improvements. For risk-tolerant investors, the company's strategic investments in infrastructure hardening and low-carbon technologies could offer long-term upside. However, those prioritizing stability may prefer peers with stronger refining margins and ESG ratings.

In the end, the Whiting Refinery's story is a microcosm of the energy sector's broader challenge: navigating the dual pressures of climate adaptation and decarbonization. For BP, the next phase of its journey will test whether its crisis management strategies can evolve into a blueprint for sustainable resilience.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-23 19:04:01.017200

The Jefferson City Council recently postponed a public hearing for a bill approving a Chapter 353 redevelopment agreement to the owners of 208 Marshall St. City attorney Ryan Moehlman said the delay is due to additional paperwork needing to go out to the taxing districts.

The public hearing will now be Sept. 2 during the City Council meeting, which starts at 6 p.m. at City Hall.

The owners of 208 Marshall St., D.J. Drury and Chad Stockman, intend on redeveloping the building to lease as apartments.

Chapter 353 provides tax benefits for redevelopment in ""blighted areas"" or areas that are unsafe, unsanitary and/or deteriorating.

The program would provide Drury and Stockman a 75-percent tax abatement for the first 15 years and a 50-percent tax abatement for the following five years.

The property yields about $355 in annual tax revenue and the city's law department estimates the tax revenue from 20 years without development would generate $8,600 in tax revenue. With development and the tax abatement, the city estimates the property would generate $689,800 in tax revenue. With development but without the tax abatement, the city estimates the property would generate $250,400 in tax revenue.

The owners had Bandre, Hunt, Snider, LLC conduct a blight study, which determined that the Marshall Street building meets the requirements due to a collapsed roof and ceilings, moisture on the walls and floors, rusty and destroyed plumbing and broken windows.

The Marshall Street building, an art-deco style structure, was known as the ""Prince Edward Apartments"" when it was built in the 1930s. The apartment building is part of the Capitol Avenue Historic District listed on the National Register of Historic Properties.

The owners hope to complete renovation by December or January and have tenants inside almost immediately, according to Drury.

The apartment will have 25 total units -- 15 one-bedroom apartments, seven two-bedroom apartments, two studio apartments and one rooftop penthouse unit.

Drury said rent will be between $850 and $1,850 a month. Amenities will include a furnished courtyard deck, a washer and dryer in each unit, 11 private storage units and on-site bicycle and electric scooter parking.

The City Council also just approved a real-estate agreement with Drury for 528 E. Capitol Ave., where he plans on building a duplex and adding a parking lot to accommodate 208 Marshall St. There is also off-street parking available on Marshall Street.

Drury said this apartment building will be great for Jefferson City's downtown scene, as he said the historic apartment buildings keep the ""urban-style living"" that people want when they live downtown.

The inside of the 208 Marshall St. apartments will be entirely new, Drury said, since he had to gut the interior due to years of water damage. He said he's spoken to people who are excited about having more options for living in downtown Jefferson City, especially people who walk to work.

""I've already talked to seven or eight people that work downtown that don't have vehicles and are like, 'Hey, well, count me in,'"" Drury said.

But before anybody can move in, Drury said he and the rest of the development team still have to set up utilities, which he said was ""the most daunting task at the moment."" He said he's eager to provide more housing in Jefferson City and watch the town grow during the next few years.",https://wehco.media.clients.ellingtoncms.com/imports/adg/img/2025/08/23/210878608_IMG_0763_cropped_t1200.jpeg?57a0c2296240c280e9492005c3cad63e7cbe80f4,N,,2025-08-23 17:02:09.053047

It's encouraging to see more EV charging infrastructure coming to communities nationwide. That trend can help quell drivers' range anxiety while offering a convenient service.

Unfortunately, there are many drivers who seemingly want to make a point of expressing their anti-EV sentiments. There are far too many disturbing stories of EV charging cords being stolen and spots being deliberately blocked.

These stunts collectively can discourage drivers who are weighing the switch to an EV. Driving an EV comes with major benefits like fuel and maintenance savings as well as reducing contributions to air pollution.

The more EVs on the roads, the less reliance on dirty energy that is warming the planet with increasingly devastating consequences. Charging availability is definitely a key to making EVs more palatable to many drivers, so instances like the Redditor's are disheartening to see.

Users on Reddit were frustrated with the original poster's situation and proposed some ideas to help.

Chuck Schumer and Gov.","The Trump administration halted construction on a nearly complete offshore wind project near Rhode Island as the White House continues to attack the battered U.S. offshore wind industry that scientists say is crucial to the urgent fight against climate change.

Danish wind farm developer Orsted says the Revolution Wind project is about 80% complete, with 45 out of its 65 turbines already installed.

Despite that progress — and the fact that the project had cleared years of federal and state reviews — the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management issued the order Friday, saying the federal government needs to review the project and “address concerns related to the protection of national security interests of the United States.”

It did not specify what the national security concerns are.

President Donald Trump has made sweeping strides to prioritize fossil fuels and hinder renewable energy projects. Trump recently called wind and solar power “THE SCAM OF THE CENTURY!” in a social media post and vowed not to approve wind or “farmer destroying Solar” projects. “The days of stupidity are over in the USA!!!” he wrote on his Truth Social site this week.

Scientists across the globe agree that nations need to rapidly embrace renewable energy to stave off the worst effects of climate change, including extreme heat and drought; larger, more intense wildfires and supercharged hurricanes, typhoons and rainstorms that lead to catastrophic flooding.

Rhode Island Gov. Dan McKee criticized the stop-work order and said he and Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont “will pursue every avenue to reverse the decision to halt work on Revolution Wind” in a post on X. Both governors are Democrats.

Construction on Revolution Wind began in 2023, and the project was expected to be fully operational next year. Orsted says it is evaluating the financial impact of stopping construction and is considering legal proceedings.

Revolution Wind is located more than 15 miles (24 kilometers) south of the Rhode Island coast, 32 miles (51 kilometers) southeast of the Connecticut coast and 12 miles (19 kilometers) southwest of Martha’s Vineyard. Rhode Island is already home to one offshore wind farm, the five-turbine Block Island Wind Farm.

Revolution Wind was expected to be Rhode Island and Connecticut’s first commercial-scale offshore wind farm, capable of powering more than 350,000 homes. The densely populated states have minimal space available for land-based energy projects, which is why the offshore wind project is considered crucial for the states to meet their climate goals.

“This arbitrary decision defies all logic and reason — Revolution Wind’s project was already well underway and employed hundreds of skilled tradesmen and women. This is a major setback for a critical project in Connecticut, and I will fight it,” Connecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat, said in a statement.

Wind power is the largest source of renewable energy in the U.S. and provides about 10% of the electricity generated in the nation.

“Today, the U.S. has only one fully operational large-scale offshore wind project producing power. That is not enough to meet America’s rising energy needs. We need more energy of all types, including oil and gas, wind, and new and emerging technologies,” said Erik Milito, president of the National Ocean Industries Association, a group that supports offshore oil, gas and wind.

Green Oceans, a nonprofit that opposes the offshore wind industry, applauded the BOEM’s decision. “We are grateful that the Trump Administration and the federal government are taking meaningful action to preserve the fragile ocean environment off the coasts of Rhode Island and Massachusetts,” the nonprofit said in a statement.

This is the second major offshore wind project the White House has halted. Work was stopped on Empire Wind, a New York offshore wind project, but construction was allowed to resume after New York Sen. Chuck Schumer and Gov. Kathy Hochul, both Democrats, intervened.

“This administration has it exactly backwards. It’s trying to prop up clunky, polluting coal plants while doing all it can to halt the fastest growing energy sources of the future – solar and wind power,"" said Kit Kennedy, managing director for the power division at Natural Resources Defense Council, in a statement. “Unfortunately, every American is paying the price for these misguided decisions.”

Continue to share your perspectives on these worrisome efforts to dismantle established science and policy progress in the EPA open comment period.","Two weeks ago — in my August 9 column — I shared Trump Administration plans for “the largest deregulatory action in the history of the United States.” Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin announced the proposal on July 29.

Zeldin shared plans to revoke the landmark 2009 “endangerment finding” that authorizes the EPA to regulate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from sources like power plants, cars and trucks. It has effectively directed the EPA to address planet-warming fossil fuel burning over the past 15+ years in the U.S. Several conservative think tanks and industry groups like the Competitive Enterprise Institute and the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers have opposed it over time. Yet, the “endangerment finding” was a 2007 Supreme Court decision that the EPA has responsibility to set emissions limits and standards on air pollution — including GHGs. Of note, the 2007 decision was a 5-4 ruling, and one of the dissenting justices was Chief Justice John Roberts.

Two weeks ago, I shared this link to an open public comment period where you can submit your views. The comment period has been extended to September 22.

On the same day as the Zeldin EPA proposal release, U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Secretary Chris Wright published a taxpayer-funded report called “A Critical Review of Impacts of Greenhouse Gas Emissions on the U.S. Climate.” This DOE report called into question several key climate science topics that have been settled, and cast uncertainty on a range of other well-researched issues about our understanding of the causes and consequences of climate change. In the weeks since that release, there has been significant renunciation from many across the climate science and policy community. Statements from well-respected scholars, researchers and practitioners have pointed out that this report was rushed past an important process of peer review (where experts in relevant research areas evaluate the quality, validity and originality of a peer’s research before it may be published). Many have also noted that findings were rushed, lacked rigor and were “cherry-picked” so that evidence was presented out of context. The DOE report also poorly represented consensus views established across the scientific community and was laden with misdirection.

What is also troubling is that the DOE report feeds misperceptions about established scientific evidence. In other words, the report can deliberately give casual news consumers an impression that there is equivalence between climate research findings from reputable peer-reviewed processes conducted by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and U.S. National Climate Assessment (which involves thousands of experts) and the findings of these five co-authors and members of the Trump Administration. This is false equivalency.

In the first Trump administration, in 2017, then-EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt proposed to form an adversarial “red team” to debate and debunk established climate science (seen as a “blue team” perspective). Under the guise of “reform,” this initiative was supported by several right-wing think tanks like the Heritage Foundation (also authors of Project 2025) and the Heartland Institute. The effort sought to elevate outlier views in the public arena and policy decision-making spaces.

Red-team/blue-team approaches have been drawn from the military, where one group (a red team) seeks to challenge another group (a blue team) by posing antagonistic or contrarian arguments. It was seen in military contexts as a useful process to rethink strategies and approaches to complex problems. Yet, its application in this scientific space is problematic.

Among logical pushback over time, the dubious 2017 Pruitt pursuit prompted a lawsuit by the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) (and the Southern Environmental Law Center). The red team/blue team plans lost momentum when Pruitt resigned in 2018. Now, we can see these ideas revived in an amped up form in this 2025 offensive.

This 2025 Trump Administration, DOE and EPA effort has now propelled EDF (and Union of Concerned Scientists) to file an August 12 lawsuit against Zeldin, Wright, the EPA and DOE for the unlawfully non-transparent and secret formation of the DOE author group as well as their effort to use their misguided assessment to overturn the endangerment finding.

Welcome back to another episode of TEN — Transport Evolved News! Thanks for joining me!

New EV sales figures for the month of July around the world have finally been tabulated, and for those who claim EV sales are falling, I am happy to report they are wrong.

Global research firm Rho Motion reported this week that one point six million electric vehicles were sold in July, up twenty-one percent year over year. That brings total sales for the year so far to ten point seven million, a twenty-seven percent increase year over year. In China, sales are up forty percent year over year, while Europe has seen a thirty percent increase year to date. That said, some countries, such as France, did see a decline. In the United States, growth was far more modest, with just a two percent increase year to date. However, President Trump’s ending of federal electric vehicle tax incentives in just over a month has prompted a surge in demand. Many buyers are rushing to purchase before the credits expire. You could call it a Trump Bump.

As automakers look to shift production around the world to maximize profits and avoid unnecessary tariffs, Kia has celebrated the start of local production of the EV4 in Slovakia for the European market.

The recently modernized facility in Zilina, Slovakia — known as Kia Autoland Slovakia — has been producing European-market internal combustion engine models for more than twenty years. However, this is the first time the facility has produced an electric vehicle. For now, only the five-door hatchback variant of the EV4 will be built at the facility. The four-door sedan — or saloon, if you prefer — will still be imported from South Korea. In addition to saving on shipping costs, domestic production allows Kia to respond more quickly to demand in Europe, which, as our previous story shows, has risen thirty percent year over year.

As Volkswagen celebrated the production of its one and a half millionth electric ID vehicle — which happened to be an all-black ID.7 Tourer Pro — the automaker has secured the deal it needs to produce its most affordable EV yet.

As reported toward the end of the week, Volkswagen has officially signed an agreement with Portugal to make its Palmela facility home to both the new ID.1, the subcompact electric vehicle due to launch in late twenty twenty-seven, and the facelifted T-ROC. The deal was signed at an official groundbreaking ceremony marking construction of a new paint shop at the site. While neither the government nor Volkswagen officially confirmed the value of the subsidies in the deal, the local newspaper Observador, citing sources close to both parties, reports that up to thirty million euros have been earmarked.

Ford and its battery partner SK On celebrated the start of official NCM battery cell production at the newly completed BlueOval SK facility in Glendale, Kentucky, United States.

The first cells to roll off the line are headed to Ford’s historic Rouge Electric Vehicle production facility in Detroit for the F150 Lightning. Additional cells will be used in other models, including the Ford E-Transit, bringing Ford closer to an all-domestic battery supply chain. BlueOval SK’s CEO confirmed to The Detroit News that production at its Tennessee facility has been delayed until twenty twenty-seven. The company, which operates independently of Ford, is also seeking new customers amid uncertainty in the United States about the future of electric vehicles under an EV-hostile government. The more contracts it secures, the more cells it can produce, the lower the cost per cell becomes, and the more sustainable and robust its business will be.

Sticking with batteries, Porsche has hit the news this week with what at first appear to be conflicting stories.

Der Spiegel reports that Porsche executives are considering an almost total shutdown of its battery subsidiary, Cellforce, keeping only a skeleton staff for research and development. The company declined to confirm or deny the report. At the same time, Porsche’s investment arm participated in a Series-D funding round worth four hundred and sixty-three million U.S. dollars for battery specialist Group14, which focuses on advanced silicon-based active cell materials. Its subsidiary V4Smart also launched second-generation lithium-ion cylindrical cells in two formats — one for high-power delivery and one for balanced energy-to-power delivery. Taken together, it appears Porsche is not ending its battery efforts, but shifting priorities to what it considers the latest, most promising technologies.

European policies designed to slow imports of Chinese-made electric vehicles — or at least even the playing field between Chinese companies and domestic brands — might be backfiring.

A new Dataforce analysis suggests automakers like BYD and MG, both of which plan to bring EV production to Europe and thus avoid tariffs, are using a stopgap measure. They are increasing their imports of plug-in hybrids until their European plants are online. Current rules do not affect plug-in hybrids in the same way as electric vehicles, meaning plug-in hybrids can, in some cases, be imported more cheaply than fully electric models. While the original tariffs were meant to affect only Chinese-made, Chinese-branded vehicles, many European manufacturers — including BMW and Volkswagen-owned Cupra — are also affected, as some of their EV models are made in China. Multiple lawsuits have already been filed against the European Union.

If you have an air quality meter — like an Air Gradient — you might notice a drop in air quality when certain electrical appliances are on, due to static electricity, heat, and poor ventilation concentrating fine particles.

A team of researchers at UCLA, California, has found the same effect around DC fast chargers. At forty-seven sites monitored in Los Angeles County, PM 2.5 reached thirty-nine micrograms per cubic meter, or an AQI of about one hundred and ten — well above typical urban background levels. Of course, fast chargers do not generate PM 2.5 directly; instead, poor cooling and design can recirculate dust and fine particles that would otherwise settle. Long term, the research team says that a few tweaks to cabinet designs could dramatically reduce localized PM 2.5 concentrations. But for now, anyone with respiratory conditions might want to avoid standing directly next to a charger for prolonged periods while it is in use.

Electric vertical takeoff and landing company Archer Aviation has just completed its longest piloted flight yet of its Midnight aircraft, covering approximately fifty-five miles (eighty-eight kilometers) in just over half an hour.

While the company cites the distance as “approximately” — which is amusing given modern instruments — it says the flight reached a top speed of over one hundred and twenty-six miles per hour (two hundred and two kilometers per hour). The week prior, test flights reportedly exceeded one hundred and fifty miles per hour (two hundred and forty-one kilometers per hour) across a variety of flight patterns. Although Archer’s press release feels intentionally vague, it is worth noting that the company currently has an ongoing test program with the U.S. Air Force and is working to obtain both FAA certification in the United States and airworthiness approval for commercial operations in the United Arab Emirates, where a significant portion of its funding comes from.

Ahead of its production launch this autumn, Nissan has confirmed that its twenty twenty-six LEAF will go on sale in the United States with a starting price under thirty thousand U.S. dollars.

The LEAF, now in its fifteenth year, will launch in three trim levels and moves away from its previous hatchback style for an all-new crossover feel. Built on the same platform as the Ariya, it will come with a fifty-two or seventy-five kilowatt-hour battery pack. While a lower-cost S- trim will eventually be available, Nissan says the S+ will be the cheapest at launch, with the larger battery and an estimated EPA range of three hundred and three miles (four hundred and eighty-seven kilometers) per charge. At twenty-nine thousand nine hundred and ninety U.S. dollars, it is the lowest MSRP of any new electric vehicle in the United States. That price excludes the soon-to-end federal tax credits, though state incentives may reduce the cost further. With an even cheaper model possibly coming later, this is very good news for fans of more affordable electric vehicles.

And finally, a quick update from U.S. political land — if you don’t want to hear about the resident Nazi in Chief, feel free to skip this section. It’s okay. I’ll wait… Still here? Strap in.

This week, in addition to trying to erase museum exhibits about slavery, deploying more armed troops to the Capitol, encouraging ethnic cleansing in Gaza, attempting to remove voting rights from millions of Americans, and trying again to ban trans healthcare — oh, and threatening the legal status of more than fifty-five million legal U.S. visa holders — President Tiny Pee Pee has instructed the Department of the Interior to deny all future solar and wind projects in the country, both on- and offshore. At this point, it seems to mostly affect grid-scale projects, but who knows? And if you’re about to rant in the comments that I’m being political — tough, we’re past quiet compliance. I am deeply sorry to the rest of the world for how hateful and selfish the Republican Party has been. They even painted over a sidewalk monument in Florida to the victims of the Pulse Night Club massacre… at night… so nobody would notice. I… am so angry. State-sponsored hate and disinformation is not — and has never been — okay.

Our final two stories are coming up next, but first, a quick word from one of today’s sponsors — Energy Sage, who can help those of you in the U.S. green your heating and energy!

Energy Sage connects you with local, verified solar installers across the United States — and now heat pump specialists in select markets — who really know their stuff and can help guide you through installing solar panels or getting a heat pump. Not a homeowner? No worries. Energy Sage can still help you green your electricity by joining a community solar program!

We used Energy Sage ourselves when looking for installers willing to put solar panels on our roof, and their verified pros were knowledgeable and even introduced us to a great credit union to finance the project with low monthly payments.

As I’m sure many of you know, HR1 is now U.S. law, and all incentives for solar — including savings of as much as thirty percent through the federal tax credit — will disappear soon. Solar projects take time, so if you want to lock in these savings, it’s important to act now because… time is running out.

Follow the links below to sign up for Energy Sage’s free, no-obligation service and get started today! And if you choose an Energy Sage installer, we’ll receive a small referral fee — so you’ll be helping us too! Help the grid get greener, save money, gain energy independence, and support our show — it’s a win-win-win-win!

And now, it’s time for those last two stories.

If you’ve been watching the news for the past few weeks, you’ll know that the U.S. Federal Government is working hard to try and eliminate the EPA’s Endangerment Finding, a key two thousand and nine finding that air pollution is damaging to human health.

The pretzel-like loops the Enriching Polluters Association have been tying themselves in to try and argue that protecting the environment and human health is not the primary concern of the EPA has been frustrating at best and enraging at worst, and as we’ve pointed out, there’s a public consultation period on the proposed rule changes. And this week marked four days of public hearing into the proposed rule changes, where supporters and opponents to the proposal got to speak. Sadly, we’re filming this before the third and fourth days of testimony are heard, but as of the time of writing this, three hundred and sixty-four people spoke in opposition to the elimination of the Endangerment Finding, while only eight spoke in support of it. I don’t think this will ultimately sway the EPA’s decision. After all, that’s not how the Federal Government under President Trump works, but it shows that there is at least some hope… as long as we all keep fighting for what’s right.

And finally…

The caped crusader has been around for more than eighty-six years, and the story of Gotham’s wealthy playboy superhero — along with his various sidekicks — has been told in countless different ways.

And of course, as Batman has evolved, so has his preferred method of transportation. From comics to the small and big screen, we’ve seen many different takes on the Batmobile — and sometimes even a motorcycle or two. Over the years there have also been plenty of tie-ins, often from high-end luxury marques. But this week, Indian automaker Mahindra unveiled something a little different: its own official, Warner Brothers-approved Batmobile — the Mahindra BE.6 Batsman Edition. It’s the company’s, and the world’s, first Batman-inspired SUV, and can be yours from just twenty-seven point seven-nine lakh rupees. Only three hundred examples will be made, with deliveries beginning on September twentieth — which also happens to be International Batman Day. So if you’re in India, or have Bruce Wayne-levels of money to ship one overseas, you could roll up to the lights, lower your window, and announce… “I’m Batman.”

And on that vocal cord-destroying note, we’re done for today!

If you’d like to support the channel, you can do so for just one dollar and fifty cents a month on Patreon — and if you can, we’d really appreciate it. Youtube, in its ultimate wisdom, is now inserting so many ads into long-form content that it’s pushing people off the platform – and it’s also diluting the money paid to creators for every ad. And because right now there’s not really a good alternative for those who don’t want to go to PeerTube (and no, Nebula is invite only, which is why we’re not on there), Patreon is really our only reliable form of income.

If just four hundred of our one hundred and fifty-two thousand subscribers who have yet signed up to patreon did so and committed to giving the equivalent of a fancy coffee a month, would put us in a much better financial position. We are preparing a massive fundraising drive this autumn with special perks for those who sign up, so keep your eyes peeled if you’d like… more incentives to support us. While it’d be lovely to all have day jobs, this channel is a full time affair and our team does deserve normal things – like healthcare and a living wage.

I should also note we’re available for third-party video production work in the Portland Oregon area, if you have a business or project you’d like us to work with you on, reach out. Below, you’ll also find links to our swag store and our Amazon affiliate link.

We publish every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday here — and every Sunday we drop two videos on Transport Evolved Take Two, our informal behind-the-scenes channel.

And in closing, some important message.

You are valid. You are loved. You belong — no matter what hateful sods try to claim.

Right now, division and hate aren’t just tolerated — they are encouraged by those in power driven by a lust for cruelty. In these times, kindness and empathy become acts of resistance. Empathy is not weakness — it’s a skill we must nurture and regularly practice to hold onto our shared humanity.

I have no words for the true horror of the current news cycle, especially if you’re in a minority group – and if you’ve needed to turn off the news or take a rest and step back from the outside world, please know that’s okay. It’s important to take care of yourself. So, when you’re feeling better, you can come back, stronger than before, to stand up for decency, community and justice. Don’t let the … you know what… win. Embrace your awesomeness, and let your light shine.

Finally, Wherever you are, whoever you are, whoever you love — you are not alone. Be an ally. Be kind. Be the change you want to see. And please — for the sake of everyone’s future — don’t let hate or ignorance win.

,Clean Energy ,2025-08-23 18:37:44+00:00,TPR: The Public's Radio,Trump halts construction on nearly complete wind farm off Rhode Island - The Public's Radio,Ben Berke,,,,,https://thepublicsradio.org/environment/trump-halts-construction-on-nearly-complete-wind-farm-off-rhode-island/,"President Trump’s administration has ordered a developer to halt construction on a nearly complete offshore wind farm off Rhode Island’s coast, casting the future of the state’s largest renewable energy project into doubt.
Orsted, a Danish energy company developing the wind farm, received construction permits from the Biden administration in 2023.
The company also has power purchase agreements with Rhode Island and Connecticut, where state officials estimated the wind farm would power up to 350,000 homes upon completion next year.
The order does not impact similarly sized offshore wind farms like Vineyard Wind and Empire Wind, which other developers are constructing in nearby federal waters.
Politicians at Rhode Island’s highest levels of government vowed to fight the Trump administration to get Revolution Wind back under construction.","President Trump’s administration has ordered a developer to halt construction on a nearly complete offshore wind farm off Rhode Island’s coast, casting the future of the state’s largest renewable energy project into doubt.

In a stop-work order issued on Friday afternoon, the federal Bureau of Ocean Energy Management said it is seeking to address national security concerns raised by the construction of Revolution Wind.

The brief letter, signed by BOEM’s acting director Matthew Giacona, did not specify what those security concerns are.

Orsted, a Danish energy company developing the wind farm, received construction permits from the Biden administration in 2023. The company also has power purchase agreements with Rhode Island and Connecticut, where state officials estimated the wind farm would power up to 350,000 homes upon completion next year.

The project was nearly 80 percent finished, according to Orsted, with 45 of its 65 turbines installed.

In a press release, Orsted said it would comply with the stop-work order while it evaluates options to resolve the matter, including legal action.

The order does not impact similarly sized offshore wind farms like Vineyard Wind and Empire Wind, which other developers are constructing in nearby federal waters. The Trump administration halted work on Empire Wind for a month this spring before allowing construction to continue.

Politicians at Rhode Island’s highest levels of government vowed to fight the Trump administration to get Revolution Wind back under construction. State officials said they are considering legal action as well.

Revolution Wind is central to Rhode Island’s plan for a complete transition to clean energy sources by 2033, which the state passed in 2021 through legislation known as the Act on Climate. Revolution Wind was projected to double Rhode Island’s supply of renewable energy when operating at full capacity, according to the state’s attorney general, Peter Neronha.

“Without Revolution Wind, our Act on Climate is dead in the water,” Neronha said. “With the significant investments made in this project already and its obvious benefit to our economy and climate, the Trump Administration’s attempt to halt it can only be characterized as bizarre.”

Rhode Island Gov. Dan McKee said the action puts hundreds of American jobs at risk. Orsted built a factory in Providence where it manufactures turbine foundations for several wind farms under development along the East Coast.

Orsted also hires from local construction unions to assemble turbines at a port facility in New London, Conn., and install them offshore about 15 miles south of Rhode Island’s coast.",https://newspack-thepublicsradio.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/01/Windfarm_115-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-08-23 16:01:55.950071
,Indiana and Evs,2025-08-23 18:33:35+00:00,Chicago Tribune,Federal grant for electric vehicles slow in coming for NWI communities - Chicago Tribune,Jim Woods,,,,,https://www.chicagotribune.com/2025/08/23/federal-grant-for-electric-vehicles-slow-in-coming-for-nwi-communities/,"Porter officials were excited in May 2023 that the town was approved for a federal grant to fund six electric-powered pickup trucks and the construction of at least two public charging stations.
But more than two years later, neither the promised Ford Lightning-150 pickup trucks nor charging stations have materialized.
The federal grant would pay 80% of the cost of a Ford Lightning F-150, priced at $55,000 in 2023.
East Chicago was hoping to get 14 electric vehicles and the city of Hobart was in line to get 16 electric vehicles.
The grant process for the federal dollars went through the Indiana Department of Transportation before going to NIRPC, Vera said.","Porter officials were excited in May 2023 that the town was approved for a federal grant to fund six electric-powered pickup trucks and the construction of at least two public charging stations.

But more than two years later, neither the promised Ford Lightning-150 pickup trucks nor charging stations have materialized.

It became a running joke at Porter Town Council meetings when Public Works Director James Spanier would give an update about the delayed delivery of the trucks. Then, he stopped talking about it.

“I’m not one to throw stones, but it’s not a smooth process from what we were told and how it came down,” Spanier said.

The federal grant would pay 80% of the cost of a Ford Lightning F-150, priced at $55,000 in 2023. That means Porter would have paid $66,000 for a fleet of six new electric pickup trucks. The grant would also pay 80% of a charging station’s price, which then cost $50,000

The town of Porter is not alone, as other communities in Porter and Lake counties have yet to receive what was promised from the $4 million grant awarded in 2023. East Chicago was hoping to get 14 electric vehicles and the city of Hobart was in line to get 16 electric vehicles.

“We have not received any of them that we were awarded,” said Jalen Robinson, public works director for East Chicago. “We’re kind of at a standstill.”

“We have not received them yet. It has been a bit of a mess,” Hobart Mayor Josh Huddlestun said.

Adrian Vera, the chief of staff for Lake Station, said that it should be understood that this grant went through a more complicated process.

Drive Clean Indiana, a nonprofit that advocates finding better environmental options, was the agency that first encouraged communities in Porter and Lake counties to apply for the funding, administered by the U.S. Department of Transportation. Vera said that Lake Station was the lead city to apply for the grant.

When asked why it takes so long, Carl Lisek, executive director of Drive Clean Indiana, replied: “Believe me, I ask that every day.”

Vera said that the grant process involved several players in the region. Some of the other communities involved were Portage, Hammond, Whiting, Schererville and Griffith.

The original source of the federal dollars coming to local communities was the $1.2 trillion Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, said Charles Bradsky, transportation projects director for the Northwestern Indiana Regional Planning Commission, or NIRPC. Then-President Joe Biden signed the bill into law on Nov. 5, 2021, with one of the stated goals being to address climate change.

The grant process for the federal dollars went through the Indiana Department of Transportation before going to NIRPC, Vera said.

Robinson said that he’s heard the hold-up could be partially attributed to the state and regional agencies “going back and forth” on procedural issues involving the grant.

While the grant was made to Porter and Lake County communities in 2023, Bradsky said that people should understand the grant’s distribution wasn’t going to happen immediately.

As the transportation projects director, Bradsky said he manages scores of Federal Highway Administration projects in Northwest Indiana.

“I cannot put everything in year one,” Bradsky said.

The Ford Lighting-150 trucks also sometimes take months to deliver. Bradsky said the distribution of funds will be spread out through 2028.

Lake Station received three of its promised six Ford Lightning-150s just a few weeks ago, Vera said. Currently, Vera said the hope is Hobart could soon receive its first three electric pickup trucks.

When Porter received its grant share, the plan was for the six F-150 Lightnings to be distributed with three to the Public Works Department and one each for the fire, police and parks departments. The town was looking at the grant as a way to significantly save money for its vehicle needs.

The town of Porter strives to be conscientious about the environment, so the town officials were excited about the possibility of offering more charging stations for public use.

The potential locations for the charging stations included downtown and Hawthorne Park. The Indiana Dunes Visitors Center already has a charging station, but if the town got enough funding, there was the possibility of the charging station being expanded.

Spanier said he probably should have figured it would take time.

“It’s not surprising when you involve that many government agencies, especially the feds. They have all sorts of rules.”

Danish wind farm developer Orsted says the Revolution Wind project is about 80% complete, with 45 out of its 65 turbines already installed.

Despite that progress — and the fact that the project had cleared years of federal and state reviews — the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management issued the order Friday, saying the federal government needs to review the project and “address concerns related to the protection of national security interests of the United States.”

It did not specify what the national security concerns are.

President Donald Trump has made sweeping strides to prioritize fossil fuels and hinder renewable energy projects. Trump recently called wind and solar power “THE SCAM OF THE CENTURY!” in a social media post and vowed not to approve wind or “farmer destroying Solar” projects. “The days of stupidity are over in the USA!!!” he wrote on his Truth Social site this week.

Scientists across the globe agree that nations need to rapidly embrace renewable energy to stave off the worst effects of climate change, including extreme heat and drought; larger, more intense wildfires and supercharged hurricanes, typhoons and rainstorms that lead to catastrophic flooding.

Rhode Island Gov. Dan McKee criticized the stop-work order and said he and Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont “will pursue every avenue to reverse the decision to halt work on Revolution Wind” in a post on X. Both governors are Democrats.

Construction on Revolution Wind began in 2023, and the project was expected to be fully operational next year. Orsted says it is evaluating the financial impact of stopping construction and is considering legal proceedings.

Revolution Wind is located more than 15 miles (24 kilometers) south of the Rhode Island coast, 32 miles (51 kilometers) southeast of the Connecticut coast and 12 miles (19 kilometers) southwest of Martha’s Vineyard. Rhode Island is already home to one offshore wind farm, the five-turbine Block Island Wind Farm.

Revolution Wind was expected to be Rhode Island and Connecticut’s first commercial-scale offshore wind farm, capable of powering more than 350,000 homes. The densely populated states have minimal space available for land-based energy projects, which is why the offshore wind project is considered crucial for the states to meet their climate goals.

“This arbitrary decision defies all logic and reason — Revolution Wind’s project was already well underway and employed hundreds of skilled tradesmen and women. This is a major setback for a critical project in Connecticut, and I will fight it,” Connecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat, said in a statement.

Wind power is the largest source of renewable energy in the U.S. and provides about 10% of the electricity generated in the nation.

Green Oceans, a nonprofit that opposes the offshore wind industry, applauded the BOEM’s decision. “We are grateful that the Trump Administration and the federal government are taking meaningful action to preserve the fragile ocean environment off the coasts of Rhode Island and Massachusetts,” the nonprofit said in a statement.

This is the second major offshore wind project the White House has halted. Work was stopped on Empire Wind, a New York offshore wind project, but construction was allowed to resume after New York Sen. Chuck Schumer and Gov. Kathy Hochul, both Democrats, intervened.

“This administration has it exactly backwards. It’s trying to prop up clunky, polluting coal plants while doing all it can to halt the fastest growing energy sources of the future – solar and wind power,"" said Kit Kennedy, managing director for the power division at Natural Resources Defense Council, in a statement. “Unfortunately, every American is paying the price for these misguided decisions.”

For investors, reconciling these dynamics is critical—especially for companies like Enphase Energy (NASDAQ: ENPH), which sits at the intersection of disruptive innovation and structural challenges.

Enphase's Financials: A Tale of Two Margins

Enphase's Q2 2025 results reveal a company navigating a fragile balance. Revenue rose to $363.2 million, driven by 11% growth in Europe and 3% in the U.S., with 1.53 million microinverters and 190.9 MWh of IQ Batteries shipped. Gross margins remained robust at 46.9% (GAAP) and 48.6% (non-GAAP), though the latter excludes a 11.4% boost from Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) incentives. This dependency raises questions about sustainability.

Non-GAAP operating income hit $98.6 million, translating to a trailing P/E of ~55x at a stock price of $38.17. While this high multiple reflects optimism about Enphase's leadership in residential solar and storage, it also highlights a disconnect with peers. The solar sector's average P/E is 30.1x, and Enphase's 44.3x EBITDA multiple dwarfs the peer median of 9.0x. This valuation dislocation stems from a 67.9% drop in EBITDA from 2023 to 2024, driven by elevated R&D (15.1%) and SG&A (25.4%) costs.

Sector-Wide Headwinds: Policy, Prices, and People

The solar industry's broader challenges amplify Enphase's risks. Price volatility persists despite IRA-driven optimism, with residential solar prices up 3% year-over-year. Soft costs—permits, labor, interconnection—remain stubbornly high in the U.S., eroding the benefits of falling hardware prices. Meanwhile, interconnection delays and labor shortages are slowing project timelines, particularly in the utility-scale segment.

Policy uncertainty looms large. While the IRA has boosted deployment forecasts by 67%, its future under a potential administration shift remains unclear. For Enphase, which relies on U.S. tax credits for its 45X production tax credits, this creates a double-edged sword: near-term tailwinds versus long-term exposure to regulatory risk.

Strategic Moves and Valuation Realism

Enphase's response to these challenges has been mixed. The company has repurchased $30 million in shares, reduced capital expenditures, and launched the IQ Battery 5P with higher domestic content to qualify for IRA benefits. Yet its ROIC of 4.4% in 2024—down from 19.8% in 2023—suggests underutilized assets and weak capital efficiency.

A discounted cash flow (DCF) model offers a more grounded view. With free cash flow of $18.4 million in Q2 and projections of $715 million by 2035, Enphase's intrinsic value is estimated at $45.96 per share, a 16.9% discount to its current price. This suggests the market is pricing in a recovery that may not materialize unless Enphase achieves its 2026 targets: $1.8–$2.0 billion in revenue and 20%+ EBITDA margins.

Is Enphase Undervalued? A Cautious Case

The answer hinges on two factors: execution risk and sector resilience. Enphase's high P/E and EBITDA multiples are justified only if it can:

1. Reduce costs through manufacturing consolidation and R&D efficiency.

2. Scale battery sales to offset declining microinverter margins.

3. Navigate policy shifts without losing IRA eligibility.

For now, the stock appears overvalued on earnings but undervalued on cash flow. Its DCF-based intrinsic value and strategic pivot toward storage offer a margin of safety, but the path to profitability is fraught. Investors must weigh Enphase's innovation in distributed energy resources against its operational inefficiencies and sector-wide headwinds.

Investment Advice: A Wait-and-See Approach

Enphase Energy is a high-conviction play for those who believe in the democratization of energy storage and the IRA's long-term impact. However, the current valuation reflects optimism that may not be warranted. A buy is justified only if the company:

- Delivers 20%+ EBITDA margins by 2026.

- Maintains its leadership in residential storage as competition intensifies.

- Avoids further margin erosion from rising component costs.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-23 16:02:24.692818

China’s CNAF to Invest in Private Chinese SAF Plant

(Reuters) China National Aviation Fuel Co. (CNAF) said on Aug. 18 it had agreed to acquire a stake in a sustainable aviation fuel plant controlled by private biofuel producer Henan Junheng Industry Group Biotech Co.

This marks CNAF’s second such investment in a privately controlled green jet fuel maker. CNAF is China’s dominant distributor of aviation fuel.

CNAF announced the signing of the investment agreement on its official WeChat platform but did not give any financial details.

Central China-based Junheng is one of China’s first commercial SAF refiners, processing used cooking oil (UCO) into the low-carbon fuel.

China is the world’s largest UCO producer.

Junheng is expanding its 400,000 tonnes-per-year SAF plant in the city of Puyang, Henan province, to reach 1 million tonnes per year around June 2026.

Last month, CNAF became a strategic investor in an east China-based SAF plant controlled by Zhejiang Jiaao Enprotech, by agreeing to acquire a 10% stake at about 261 million yuan (US$36.35 million), according to a Jiaao stock filing.

China, the world’s second-largest aviation fuel market, has yet to announce a national mandate for the use of SAF. It began a pilot scheme last September for the first use of SAF in a dozen flights departing from domestic airports in Beijing, Chengdu, Zhengzhou and Ningbo. That was expanded in March to all domestic flights departing these airports.

Leap’s platform focuses on building and scaling VPPs with software, while Texture’s AI-native energy operations platform integrates with energy data sources to create a data cloud that powers workflows. By integrating their offerings, the duo gives storage companies access to customized VPP programming.

“The collaboration provides a turnkey solution that significantly reduces time to market by lowering technical and operational barriers to entry in grid services, such as time-consuming Measurement & Verification processes and data sharing challenges,” the release said.

Initial partners include solar developer Solridge, solar and battery installer Haven Energy and a major residential storage manufacturer, according to the news release.

US Defense Department to Buy Cobalt for up to $500MM

(Reuters) The U.S. is seeking to procure cobalt worth up to $500 million for defense stockpiles amid the country’s move to boost its critical mineral supplies.

Companies have been scrambling to source rare earths after China imposed restrictions, leading to a 75% drop in rare earth magnet exports from the country in June and causing some auto companies to suspend production.

U.S. President Donald Trump in March invoked emergency powers to boost domestic production of critical minerals as part of a broad effort to offset China’s near-total control of the sector.

According to the tender document published by the U.S. Department of Defense and the Defense Logistics Agency on Aug. 20, they are looking for offers for alloy-grade cobalt of about 7,480 tonnes over the next five years.

Cobalt, mostly imported by the U.S., is used in batteries, a component in nickel superalloys for high temperature sections of jet engines and industrial gas turbines, among others.

However, the defense department was seeking offers from only three companies—units of Vale SA in Canada, Japan’s Sumitomo Metal Mining and Norway’s Glencore Nikkelverk. The document also said the purchase amount can range from between $2 million and $500 million in the five-year period.

Fluence Starts Production at New Facility in Houston

Fluence Energy on Aug. 21 said it has started producing thermal management systems for its battery energy storage systems at its new manufacturing facility in Houston.

The company said the facility, in partnership with Bergstrom, will play a role in its strategy to onshore production of every major product and component of a grid-scale battery energy storage system in the U.S. Systems produced at the Houston site include HVAC and chiller equipment, Fluence said in a news release.

“There’s broad recognition of the enormous value batteries bring to the electricity grid—to address increased power demand, maintain reliability, and lower costs,"" said John Zahurancik, president of Fluence Americas. “With this Houston facility and our broader network of U.S. manufacturing plants, U.S.-made battery energy storage is playing a growing role in domestic power production and energy security.”

Virginia-headquartered Fluence said it has more than 22,000 MWh of battery energy storage capacity deployed or contracted across more than 90 projects in the U.S.

Viridi Installs BESS at Denver Public Library

Viridi, in partnership with construction and energy services company McKinstry, on Aug. 20 said it has installed a fail-safe battery energy storage system at the Denver Public Library, calling it a first-of-a-kind solar and storage project.

The company said its behind-the-meter RPSLinkEX system captures excess solar energy for use during non-solar hours, while reducing peak demand and providing backup power during outages. The system is fully integrated into the library’s existing infrastructure and monitored through Viridi’s ViSTA Dashboard.

New York Awards Over $11MM for Hydrogen R&D Projects

Five hydrogen R&D projects are the recipients of more than $11 million doled out by New York as the state works to lower emissions in industrial processes.

Selected through the Advanced Fuels and Thermal Energy Research Program, the projects will “demonstrate new technology designs, cost reductions associated with clean hydrogen storage and distribution, evaluate large-scale clean hydrogen storage opportunities, and deploy zero-emission hydrogen-powered transportation,” the New York State Energy Research & Development Authority said Aug. 21 in a news release.

Stony Brook University was awarded more than $4.9 million for a low-pressure, ambient-temperature hydrogen storage system at Northwell Health Hospital.

National Grid Ventures was awarded $2 million to install the first commercially deployed, fully hydrogen-fueled linear generator at its Northport Power Plant in Fort Salonga.

Plug Power and partner Verne landed $2 million to co-develop new hydrogen distribution trailers with cryo-compressed storage technologies.

Switch Maritime was awarded $2 million to develop and demonstrate New York’s first hydrogen fuel cell-electric ferry.

GTI Energy was awarded more than $220,000 to study New York’s geological hydrogen storage potential for large-scale, long-duration energy storage.

“New York’s investments in clean hydrogen are helping to unlock this emerging resource as a potential contributor to the state’s affordable, abundant and reliable energy system,” said New York Gov. Kathy Hochul. “Advancing alternative fuels like clean hydrogen will grow our clean energy economy while reducing emissions statewide.”

The projects were funded through New York’s $6 billion Clean Energy Fund.

Geronimo Starts Construction on 125-MW Solar Plant in Michigan

Construction has commenced for the 125-megawatt (MW) Jackson County solar project in Michigan, developer Geronimo Power (formerly National Grid Renewables) said Aug. 18.

The solar facility is expected to generate enough electricity to power an estimated 33,600 homes annually when it begins operations in 2026, the company said. It will be the latest in the Geronimo’s MiSolar Portfolio, which also includes the 20-MW Bingham Solar facility in Clinton County and the 20-MW Temperance Solar facility in Monroe County.

All three serve the Midwestern Independent System Operator (MISO) market. The solar facilities will lift Geronimo’s capacity in the MISO region to nearly 1 gigawatt, the company said.

Silicon Ranch to Build 100-MW Solar Farm Supporting Meta

Solar developer Silicon Ranch has partnered with Central Electric Power Cooperative to build a 100-MW solar farm to support Meta’s first data center in South Carolina, according to a news release Aug. 19.

Located in Orangeburg County, the solar farm will be Silicon and Central’s fourth project together and the 18th infrastructure project between Meta and Silicon, the solar developer said.

Working with system balancing authority Santee Cooper, Silicon said it will fund, own and operate the solar farm. Electricity produced will be purchased by Central to benefit its member cooperatives. The cooperatives, the release said, includes Aiken Electric, which serves the Meta facility being constructed near Graniteville, South Carolina.

Both the data center and the solar farm are expected to start operations in 2027, according to the release.

China’s Solar Industry Association Calls for End to Price Wars

(Reuters) China’s solar industry association on Aug. 22 called for solar manufacturers to stop selling components below cost and advocated for “survival of the fittest” market competition—but stopped short of calling for capacity closures to address oversupply in the industry.

In a statement following multi-day consultations with the solar industry and a raft of government stakeholders, the China Photovoltaic Industry Association said in a statement on its WeChat account that companies should schedule their production on the basis of market supply and demand and strictly adhere to China’s price law—a nod to the prevailing practices of expanding production to try to maintain market share while undercutting competitors, leading to surging overcapacity.

The statement also called on solar companies to maintain safety and quality standards and abide by intellectual property rules and asked power-generating firms to reduce the weighting that they give to component prices in the bidding process.

Costs and Technology Trends Today, PEM electrolyzers and clean power make green hydrogen more costly than fossil hydrogen.","The United States is adding a lot of solar power. It is also building ways to store that energy as green hydrogen. The idea is simple. Solar makes clean electricity in the day. Electrolyzers use some of that power to split water and make hydrogen. Later, hydrogen turns back into power for the evening and for cloudy hours. This loop is a path to steady, cleaner energy.

What Is Green Hydrogen?

Green hydrogen is made by electrolysis. An electrolyzer uses electricity to split water into hydrogen and oxygen. If the electricity is renewable, the hydrogen has very low lifecycle emissions. The U.S. Department of Energy’s Hydrogen Shot sets a clear target: cut the cost of clean hydrogen to $1 per kilogram

How Solar and Hydrogen Work Together

Solar panels make electricity when the sun shines.

Electrolyzers use part of that power to make hydrogen.

Storage keeps hydrogen in safe tanks or other spaces.

Fuel cells or turbines turn hydrogen back into power at night or during storms.

In short, solar provides energy; hydrogen provides time-shifted energy. NREL research shows electrolyzers can fit well as renewables grow.

Solar Growth in the U.S.

New clean capacity is rising fast. The Energy Information Administration (EIA) expects about 63 gigawatts of new utility-scale capacity in 2025. More than half is set to be solar. Battery storage also grows, and together they make up about 81% of the expected additions.

EIA also reports that developers brought many gigawatts online this year, with large shares in key states. The growth calls for more storage to keep power reliable after sunset.

Policies and Programs Shaping the Market

Policy / Program What It Does Why It Matters 45V Clean Hydrogen Production Tax Credit (Treasury) Final rules set tiers of support based on lifecycle emissions. To qualify as “clean,” hydrogen must be ≤ 4 kg CO2e per kg H2. Lowers costs for the cleanest hydrogen made in the U.S. and gives investors clarity. Finalized Jan. 3, 2025. Hydrogen Shot (DOE) Targets clean hydrogen at $1/kg within a decade. Signals long-term U.S. commitment and supports innovation and scale. Regional Clean Hydrogen Hubs (DOE) Up to $7 billion to build seven hubs for production, delivery, and use. Kickstarts early markets in power, transport, and industry. Includes demand-side support tools.

Benefits and Trade-Offs

Reliability: Hydrogen stores energy for night and for long gaps. This helps solar do more work.

Lower emissions: Electrolyzers powered by renewables avoid direct CO2. The 45V rules also reward cleaner pathways.

Domestic energy: Hydrogen can be made from water and American power. It can support energy security.

Hard-to-electrify uses: Industry, heavy trucks, and backup power can use clean hydrogen.

Challenges: Electrolyzers and power can be costly today, and new pipes and storage take time. Research points to cost drops as factories scale.

Sector Need How Hydrogen Helps Power Night and seasonal gaps in supply. Long-duration storage for a grid with lots of solar and batteries. Industry High heat and feedstocks. Clean fuel and inputs for steel, chemicals, and refineries in hub plans. Transport Heavy duty, long range, fast refueling. Fuel cells offer zero tailpipe CO2 and quick fills for trucks and fleets.

Costs and Technology Trends

Today, PEM electrolyzers and clean power make green hydrogen more costly than fossil hydrogen. But that gap can shrink. An NREL cost study shows materials, stacks, and power electronics are big cost drivers now. Larger factories and better supply chains can reduce prices over time.

Another NREL study finds that electrolyzers can run when power is cheap and pause when it is not. This flexible mode can lower the cost of hydrogen and help the grid.

Research teams continue to improve electrolyzer efficiency and durability in the U.S. lab network. Work in 2025 focuses on stacks, membranes, and balance-of-plant to raise output and cut costs.

What to Watch in 2025

Project pipelines: EIA expects solar to lead new capacity. Watch grid connections and storage builds through year-end.

45V implementation: The Treasury rules are final. Developers will align designs and contracts to qualify.

Hydrogen hubs: DOE’s hubs move from awards into agreements and then construction. Demand-side tools seek real customers.

Electrolyzer supply: U.S. and global manufacturers scale production. Costs may fall as volumes grow.

The campus, sited on more than 8,000 acres, is designed “to support hyperscale data centers and the next wave of artificial intelligence [AI] innovation,” Pacifico Energy said on August 20.

The group said the project, in development since early last year, will bring its first gigawatt of generation online in 2028. The company, with U.S. operations based in California and Texas, said its “off-grid approach removes reliance on the electricity grid, responsibly delivering unmatched speed-to-deployment with direct control over energy supply, and ‘five nines’ of reliability for digital infrastructure operators.

“GW Ranch isn’t just about scale—it’s about certainty,” said Constantyn Gieskes, vice president at Pacifico Energy. “Every aspect of the project has been designed to solve problems with the status quo in data center development. By building off-grid and working hand-in-hand with local officials, we’re delivering the speed, reliability, and responsible development that our customers and communities both demand.”

Project’s Full Power Set for 2030

Pacifico Energy said the full 5 GW of gas-fired power will be available in 2030. The company said permitting has begun with the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, and added that the project is supported by Pecos County officials. Pacifico said the GW Ranch design includes dual gas pipeline connections. It will be built in a modular design to enable scaling, and will feature advanced emissions-control technology to reduce its environmental impact.

“Pecos County’s continued effort to diversify the local economy directly aligns with the development of GW Ranch. The minimal impact of an off-grid data center will increase the county tax base, create new jobs, and have an overall positive impact on our county while conserving water and placing no constraints on local infrastructure,” said Remie Ramos, economic development director for Pecos County. “We look forward to helping GW Ranch expedite all processes to bring the project to fruition in the near future.”

The project will include 1.8 GW of battery energy storage, according to Pacifico. The company said the installation will be “fully independent from the ERCOT grid,” with “no impact on consumer prices or grid reliability.

The company's focus on affordability and domestic production—key requirements for tax credit eligibility—has positioned it to outperform rivals.
Cox Automotive revised its 2025 EV market share forecast from 10% to 8.5%, citing the expiration of incentives and economic uncertainty.
GM and Ford, meanwhile, are focusing on cost efficiency and domestic supply chains to meet tax credit sourcing requirements.
Investors must also consider the Biden administration's broader EV policies, such as production tax credits for batteries and critical minerals.","The U.S. federal EV tax credit, extended through September 30, 2025, has undergone a transformative shift with the IRS's introduction of “contract-based flexibility.” This provision allows consumers to qualify for the $7,500 tax credit by entering a binding contract to purchase an electric vehicle before the deadline, even if delivery occurs afterward. This rule change has profound implications for automakers like Tesla, General Motors (GM), and Ford, reshaping market dynamics, consumer behavior, and stock valuations.

The Mechanics of Contract-Based Flexibility

The IRS's updated guidance defines a binding contract as one with a nominal down payment or trade-in, effectively extending the eligibility window for buyers facing logistical delays. For example, a consumer ordering a vehicle that requires cross-state shipping or is still in production can still claim the credit if the contract is finalized before September 30. This flexibility aligns with legislative intent to treat contracts as purchases, ensuring that supply chain or manufacturing delays don't disqualify buyers.

This provision has created a surge in pre-deadline contracts, particularly for high-demand models. Automakers must now prioritize securing early commitments from buyers, even if delivery is delayed. For Tesla, this means managing expectations for the Model 3 and Model Y, which remain eligible for the full credit. GM and Ford, meanwhile, are leveraging their expanding EV lineups—such as the Chevrolet Equinox EV and Ford F-150 Lightning—to capture market share before the credit expires.

Consumer Behavior and Market Timing

The contract-based flexibility has accelerated consumer decision-making. According to Cox Automotive, EV sales in Q3 2025 spiked as buyers rushed to lock in contracts before the tax credit's expiration. This surge has been most pronounced for automakers with strong brand loyalty and production capacity. Tesla, for instance, reported 384,122 deliveries in Q2 2025, but this figure masks a 13.5% year-over-year decline, reflecting waning demand as the credit's end looms.

GM, however, has capitalized on the urgency. Its EV sales grew by 111% in Q2 2025, with the Chevrolet brand becoming the second-best-selling EV brand in the U.S. The company's focus on affordability and domestic production—key requirements for tax credit eligibility—has positioned it to outperform rivals. Ford, while less dominant, has seen a 2.62% stock price increase in August 2025, suggesting investor confidence in its ability to navigate the post-credit landscape.

Stock Valuations and Investor Sentiment

The tax credit's expiration has created divergent trajectories for automakers. Tesla's stock, which fell 18% in 2025, faces headwinds as its reliance on regulatory credits and high-end models (which are now ineligible for the leasing loophole) becomes apparent. The company's Q2 2025 earnings showed a 42% drop in operating income, with nearly half tied to regulatory credits. Analysts warn that Tesla's margins could turn negative in the next two quarters, raising concerns about its long-term viability.

GM, in contrast, has demonstrated resilience. Despite a 35.4% drop in net income due to Trump-era tariffs, its EV sales and strategic investments in battery production have bolstered investor confidence. The company's stock rose 3.66% in early August 2025, reflecting optimism about its profitability timeline. Ford's stock, while less volatile, has shown modest gains, indicating a cautious but positive outlook.

The broader EV market is also feeling the ripple effects. Cox Automotive revised its 2025 EV market share forecast from 10% to 8.5%, citing the expiration of incentives and economic uncertainty. This shift has led to a reevaluation of EV stocks, with investors favoring automakers with diversified product lines and strong ICE (internal combustion engine) sales.

Policy Uncertainty and Future Outlook

The One Big Beautiful Bill (OBBB) has further complicated the landscape by accelerating the tax credit's expiration and eliminating the leasing loophole. This has forced automakers to pivot strategies. Tesla, for example, is doubling down on Full Self-Driving (FSD) technology and robotaxi services to differentiate itself. GM and Ford, meanwhile, are focusing on cost efficiency and domestic supply chains to meet tax credit sourcing requirements.

Investors must also consider the Biden administration's broader EV policies, such as production tax credits for batteries and critical minerals. These incentives could offset some of the post-credit challenges, but their effectiveness remains untested.

Investment Advice

For investors, the key takeaway is to prioritize automakers with strong domestic production capabilities and diversified revenue streams. GM appears best positioned to weather the post-credit era, with its focus on affordability and supply chain resilience. Tesla's long-term potential hinges on its ability to monetize FSD and robotaxi services, but its near-term risks are significant. Ford, while less dominant, offers a safer bet for those seeking exposure to the EV transition without overreliance on tax credits.

In conclusion, the IRS's contract-based flexibility has created a race against time for EV buyers and automakers alike. While the tax credit's expiration poses challenges, it also highlights the importance of innovation, supply chain agility, and strategic foresight. For investors, the next 12 months will be critical in determining which automakers can thrive in a post-incentive world.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-23 18:04:11.742278

SAN FRANCISCO – The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit on Thursday denied the Trump administration’s request to stay a lower court order requiring the reinstatement of federal research grants that had been terminated earlier this year as part of a sweeping campaign to eliminate funding tied to diversity, equity, and inclusion programs.

The case, Thakur v. Trump, was filed by a group of University of California researchers whose multi-year grants from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the National Science Foundation (NSF), and the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) were abruptly cancelled in April. The agencies sent form letters citing changes in priorities and referencing recent executive orders issued by President Trump in January and February 2025. Those orders, which created the Department of Government Efficiency, directed agencies to end projects related to DEI, environmental justice, and similar initiatives.

The plaintiffs alleged the cancellations were unlawful because they were not based on any individualized review of the projects, but instead reflected broad policy directives. They sued in the Northern District of California, arguing the actions violated the Administrative Procedure Act, the First and Fifth Amendments, and separation of powers. In June, the district court issued a preliminary injunction requiring the reinstatement of the grants and provisionally certified two classes of researchers: one for those who received form termination letters with no individualized reasoning and another for those whose grants were ended under the DEI-related orders.

The government appealed and sought a partial stay of the injunction, limited to grants issued by the EPA and NEH. A three-judge panel of the Ninth Circuit, led by Judge Morgan Christen, rejected the request. “We deny the government’s motion,” Christen wrote in the opinion.

The panel found that the government had not shown it was likely to succeed on the merits of its arguments. The court said the termination letters were vague, citing broad rationales such as failure to “serve the best interests of the United States” or inconsistency with agency priorities, without specifying how they applied to particular projects. “The recipients of the form letter and the public were left to guess at the reasons for these terminations,” the court noted.

The opinion highlighted the case of Dr. Neeta Thakur, whose $1.3 million EPA grant to study the impact of wildfire smoke on California communities was terminated seven months before its scheduled end. The court said the government provided no evidence that the EPA considered reliance interests or the taxpayer investments that would be lost if the project was not completed.

On the First Amendment claim, the panel concluded that the government likely engaged in unconstitutional viewpoint discrimination by targeting projects associated with DEI, environmental justice, and gender-related research. The court rejected the government’s argument that it was simply choosing not to fund certain activities, distinguishing the case from earlier Supreme Court decisions. Instead, the judges found that the administration “selected grants for termination based on viewpoint” and reinforced the principle that, while the government has discretion in allocating subsidies, it cannot suppress disfavored ideas.

The court also rejected the government’s claim that it would suffer irreparable harm by being compelled to disburse funds that it might not later recover. While acknowledging that some funds might not be recouped, the judges found the harms to researchers and the public were more significant. They cited layoffs, disruptions to graduate programs, reputational injury, and the destruction of research projects, along with the waste of taxpayer dollars already invested.

“The government cannot suffer harm from an injunction that merely ends an unlawful practice,” the panel wrote, citing its precedent in Rodriguez v. Robbins.

The Ninth Circuit’s ruling leaves intact the district court’s order requiring the reinstatement of the cancelled grants while the case proceeds. The broader litigation will continue to determine whether the Trump administration’s executive orders and resulting grant terminations violated constitutional and statutory limits.

“After the last four years of red tape and taxpayer-funded failures, America needs more energy,” Behrens said.
“This move from the Department of Interior certainly helps deliver.” Commingling is “the practice of combining oil or gas production from two or more sources into a single stream for measurement and processing,” according to a Department of the Interior news release.
The American Council on Renewable Energy, a group dedicated to energy forms like wind and solar, has not yet responded to The Center Square’s request for comment.
“BSEE has finalized a rule to clarify expectations for offshore commingling, ensuring production methods protect well integrity, safety and ultimate recovery,” the release said.","WASHINGTON, D.C. – Oil and gas commingling rules have been updated in accordance with the Big Beautiful Bill in order to strengthen energy production and safety, with energy advocates’ supporting the move.

Larry Behrens from Power the Future told The Center Square: “These reforms are a win for workers and families because commingling allows domestic operators to produce more oil and natural gas at lower cost.”

Power the Future is a nonprofit dedicated to Americans working in reliable energy sources, according to its website.

“After the last four years of red tape and taxpayer-funded failures, America needs more energy,” Behrens said. “This move from the Department of Interior certainly helps deliver.”

Commingling is “the practice of combining oil or gas production from two or more sources into a single stream for measurement and processing,” according to a Department of the Interior news release.

The American Council on Renewable Energy, a group dedicated to energy forms like wind and solar, has not yet responded to The Center Square’s request for comment.

Behrens told The Center Square that “commingling lets producers use shared infrastructure, which will lower the cost of doing business and lower costs for consumers.”

“It can help maximize oil recovery while still maintaining safety and accountability through modern monitoring,” Behrens said.

When asked what else needs to be done for strengthened energy production, Behrens said that “some great next steps could be expanding existing capacity at coal plants to help get more power on the grid and continue their work to bring more reliable and affordable power online.”

“Thankfully, the Trump Administration has the gas pedal to the floor on the road to energy dominance,” Behrens said.

According to the Interior Department news release, the updates made to commingling rules “provide clear standards that support safe operations, improve efficiency and maximize recovery of America’s energy resources.”

The updates are intended to “strengthen energy production and safety.”

The updates are led by the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) and the Bureau of Land Management (BLM).

“BSEE has finalized a rule to clarify expectations for offshore commingling, ensuring production methods protect well integrity, safety and ultimate recovery,” the release said.

Meanwhile, the BLM “is issuing interim guidance to broaden commingling authority on public and tribal lands until updated regulations are complete.”

In addition to aligning with the Big Beautiful Bill’s provisions, the updates to commingling are in accordance with Trump’s executive order “Unleashing American Energy” and support “the Trump administration’s energy and regulatory priorities” by advancing the order’s goals, the release said.

The updates likewise “align with [Department of the Interior] Secretary [Doug] Burgum’s orders emphasizing safe, efficient and predictable oversight of oil and gas operations, reinforcing policies that remove unnecessary regulatory barriers while ensuring maximum resource recovery and environmental protection.”

When reached, the Department of the Interior referred The Center Square to its press release on the updates to commingling, as well as those that concern other recent efforts to “reinforce energy dominance, economic growth, and resource resilience,” as the department told The Center Square. For instance, the Interior Department recently streamlined oil and gas leasing “to advance energy independence and economic growth”; raised the annual Gulf of America revenue-sharing cap to “support coastal protection, restoration and infrastructure projects”; and set an energy leasing schedule “to expand American energy production and strengthen U.S. energy independence.”

In the release, Burgum said that “these updates make it easier to produce American energy without unnecessary bureaucratic hurdles, while at the same time protecting taxpayers, tribes and our shared energy future by ensuring production is safe, efficient and maximizes the long-term value of our resources.”",https://dehayf5mhw1h7.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/2472/2025/08/23095552/667d8a78673f0-image.jpg,N,,2025-08-23 15:01:37.963747

Jobseekers might be surprised to learn clean energy is among the fastest growing careers right now. Labor leaders say developers are getting better at hiring union workers to build wind and solar farms but they see room for improvement in North Dakota.

Industry analysts said the clean energy workforce has a union coverage rate just above 10 percent, compared with 7 percent in the private sector.

Kevin Pranis, Minnesota and North Dakota marketing manager for the Laborers' International Union of North America, said momentum has developed over the past decade.

""We've seen a really positive shift with good union jobs that pay the same rates that members would make on a conventional energy project,"" Pranis explained.

In neighboring Minnesota, he noted they have seen a substantial increase in developers hiring local union members for projects, as opposed to out-of-state teams. And while there's progress in North Dakota, he pointed out on some projects, the percentage is still low.

He acknowledged changing the mindset is hard in a fossil fuel-heavy state but adds developers can help by conveying the wage growth in renewables.

Under the Trump administration, federal incentives for such projects are being scaled back. Pranis predicted a rush of construction jobs for renewable sites over the next two years before key credits expire. Even if demand eventually softens, he argued the sector will still be a force because of plans laid out by utilities and the training members receive pays off in other ways.

""We really train people to be construction professionals, over a set of skills that laborers focus on,"" Pranis emphasized. ""Those skills are applicable, whether it's a solar project, a wind project, a highway, a school.""

Pat Hook, business manager of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 683 in Ohio, said another complicating factor is local opposition to wind and solar projects. His union often shows up at public hearings to state the facts and dispel misinformation, so members get a chance to be hired. He sees positive movement in this area.

""The sentiment in the local area is starting to change, hopefully away from opposition because the projects were actually completed and all the kind of fears of potential things that could happen didn't,"" Hook observed.",https://kiowacountypress.net/sites/default/files/favicon-512.png,N,,2025-08-23 14:02:29.861259

The order to stop work on the Revolution Wind project is the latest move by the Trump administration targeting the country's renewable energy industry.
President Trump, a longtime critic of the wind industry, in January issued a moratorium on new development of offshore wind projects.
""Today, the U.S. has only one fully operational large-scale offshore wind project producing power,"" Milito said.
In April, the Interior Department halted work on an offshore wind project near the coast of Long Island.","The Trump administration has ordered companies to stop construction of a wind farm that's being built off the coast of Rhode Island.

The acting director of the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Matthew Giacona, wrote in a letter to one of the developers, a Danish firm called Ørsted, that the government was halting work on the almost-finished project in order to ""address concerns related to the protection of national security interests of the United States."" The project is also being developed by Global Infrastructure Partners.

The order to stop work on the Revolution Wind project is the latest move by the Trump administration targeting the country's renewable energy industry. President Trump, a longtime critic of the wind industry, in January issued a moratorium on new development of offshore wind projects. The Internal Revenue Service recently put out new guidance that makes it harder for companies building wind and solar projects to qualify for federal tax incentives. And the Commerce Department is investigating whether imports of wind turbines and their components threaten national security.

Ørsted said in a statement that it is ""evaluating all options to resolve the matter expeditiously,"" including legal action.

Revolution Wind is located in federal waters 15 miles south of Rhode Island. Construction started in 2023, and the project has been slated to begin sending power to homes and businesses in Rhode Island and Connecticut starting next year.

""Any pause or uncertainty at this stage could ripple across jobs, contracts, and communities already benefiting from the project,"" Erik Milito, president of the National Ocean Industries Association, a trade group whose members include wind project developers as well as oil and gas companies, said in a statement.

""Today, the U.S. has only one fully operational large-scale offshore wind project producing power,"" Milito said. ""That is not enough to meet America's rising energy needs. We need more energy of all types, including oil and gas, wind, and new and emerging technologies.""

The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management didn't respond to messages seeking comment.

Industry analysts have said that limiting renewable energy development amid rising electricity demand threatens to drive up power prices across the country.

""This is not the first time extreme partisan politics has derailed sound energy policy,"" Jason Grumet, chief executive of American Clean Power, an industry group, said in a statement responding to the Trump administration's stop-work order to Revolution Wind. ""The unfortunate message to investors is clear: the U.S. is no longer a reliable place for long-term energy investments.""

In April, the Interior Department halted work on an offshore wind project near the coast of Long Island. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum wrote in a letter to the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management at the time that approval of the project, called Empire Wind, ""was rushed through by the prior administration without sufficient analysis.""

Construction on Empire Wind resumed in May when the Trump administration lifted the stop-work order. But the disruption was costly for the project's developer, a Norwegian company called Equinor. The firm recently cut the value of its investment by almost $1 billion, mainly because of ""the changes in regulations for future offshore wind projects in the U.S.,"" Torgrim Reitan, Equinor's chief financial officer, said on an earnings call in July.

""For the second time, the Trump Administration has taken unlawful action against a fully permitted offshore wind project under active construction — this time one that is nearly 80% complete,"" Liz Burdock, chief executive of the Oceantic Network, an advocacy group for offshore wind, said in a statement about the Revolution Wind project.

""This dramatic action further erodes investor confidence in the U.S. market across all industries and undermines progress on shared national priorities — shipyard revitalization, steel and port investments, and energy dominance,"" Burdock said. ""In fact, halting work on Revolution Wind will drive up energy costs for consumers, idle Gulf Coast vessel operators that have invested hundreds of millions of dollars in new or retrofitted vessels, and jeopardize the livelihoods of union workers.""",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5786x3255+0+301/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fb6%2Faa%2F10fd41f4471693bc183be3012ec6%2Fap25212463742062.jpg,N,,2025-08-23 14:02:35.070684

The difference is that the Stated Policies Scenario assumes certain future policy actions, such as the extension and renewal of policies with end dates.
A Current Policies Scenario only includes the policy as written, meaning that the scenario assumes those tax credits would end, since their (likely) renewal wasn’t in writing.
A Stated Policy Scenario assumes, on the basis of policy analysis and stated aims, that the tax credits would be renewed.
The international agency very quietly confirmed in March calendar notice that this year will mark the much-debated return of the Current Policies Scenario.","A great debate is unfolding about the subjectivity of data in producing the energy outlooks that guide public policy and private spending, shaping the future of the global energy sector. The International Energy Agency has been caught in the crossfire of a partisan debate in which environmental and energy industry leaders vehemently disagree about what constitutes accuracy, truth, and good science in data, and particularly in the agency’s flagship World Energy Outlook report. And this year, the fossil fuels industry is getting its way.

It’s easy to forget that data is not objective, nor is it purely subjective. This false dichotomy, according to data expert Melanie Feinberg, “distorts the empirical realities of data collection, the challenging work of forcing unruly phenomena to speak in clean, distinct, ideally quantitative phrases.” Instead, good science is about recognizing the responsibility of being an active decision-maker to produce methods and outputs that most accurately represent complex realities.

Human-led decisions and difficult choices are being made at every step of developing a report like the International Energy Agency (IEA)’s annual World Energy Outlook – from how to collect and clean the data to how to analyze and report on it. One of those critical choices is how the agency chooses to construct its projected scenarios for the clean energy transition and the phaseout of fossil fuels.

The choice that has recently come under scrutiny is whether to include a “Current Policies Scenario” along with the typical scenarios that the agency uses to make its forecasts. The IEA based its “business as usual” outlooks on current policies until 2019, when the agency decided to switch to a “Stated Policies Scenario,” which it believed to be more accurate. The difference is that the Stated Policies Scenario assumes certain future policy actions, such as the extension and renewal of policies with end dates.

As an example, before the Inflation Reduction Act, the United States implemented solar and wind power tax credits that expired every few years, at which point they would be reviewed and adjusted as needed. A Current Policies Scenario only includes the policy as written, meaning that the scenario assumes those tax credits would end, since their (likely) renewal wasn’t in writing. A Stated Policy Scenario assumes, on the basis of policy analysis and stated aims, that the tax credits would be renewed. The argument is that while this is not based on concrete policy, it is a more accurate representation of policy – and ultimately a more accurate projection.

This change in modeling has resulted in projections that foresee a much more rapidly approaching peak fossil fuel demand. This change has yielded some harsh critiques, especially from Republican leadership. Robert McNally, president of research and analysis firm Rapidan Energy and former energy advisor for President George W. Bush, wrote an op-ed earlier this year slamming the IEA for being “neutered” by “climate politics.” McNally wrote for the Wall Street Journal that the EIA’s energy modeling is posing “significant risks” to global energy systems by encouraging underinvestment in oil and gas, thereby undermining “its vital security mission.”

The Trump administration has also been a vocal critic of the IEA, and has recently threatened to withdraw from the agency due to what it sees as ""unrealistically green” forecasting. “We will do one of two things: we will reform the way the IEA operates or we will withdraw,” said Energy Secretary Chris Wright last month. “My strong preference is to reform it.”

And now we know that the IEA has yielded to this pushback. The international agency very quietly confirmed in March calendar notice that this year will mark the much-debated return of the Current Policies Scenario. The IEA statement noted that this year’s report will include a ""wide spectrum of possible outcomes that today's markets and policies imply,"" encompassing “exploratory scenarios that flow from different assumptions about existing policies, including the Current Policies Scenario, as well as normative pathways that achieve energy and emissions goals in full.""

This marks a major policy reversal on the part of the agency, which had previously ardently defended its choice to drop the model. It also reflects a rapidly changing global policy environment that is more concerned with immediate-term energy security rather than long-term climate realities.

Building out a profitable EV business is not easy, with even major automakers often struggling to sell their EV models for a profit.
Both Tesla and Rivian stocks carry their fair share of risk.
Rivian is still unprofitable and faces near-term headwinds from tariffs and the loss of EV tax credits.
For investors willing to take on risk, Rivian is the better EV stock to own in my view.","Tesla (TSLA 6.18%) has dominated the electric vehicle (EV) market for over a decade, but the company's core business has begun to struggle. Rivian Automotive (RIVN 8.00%), meanwhile, is still in the early innings as an automaker, but is starting to hit important milestones.

Both stocks come with risk, but one has a much better setup for investors right now.

Rivian's R2 opportunity

Rivian slipped back into negative gross margins in Q2 after two straight positive quarters, with higher material costs due to supply constraints and new tariffs taking their toll. The loss of the federal $7,500 EV tax credit this fall will be another drag. Those are real headwinds, but they don't take away from the progress that Rivian has been making.

Building out a profitable EV business is not easy, with even major automakers often struggling to sell their EV models for a profit. However, Rivian took a big step in this direction when it switched to a zonal architecture. This slashed the number of electronic control units and wiring in its vehicles, making its SUVs cheaper to build. It also helped the company secure a major partnership with Volkswagen, which opened up its checkbook to gain access to the technology and form a joint venture.

The next big step for Rivian will be launching its new, smaller R2 SUV next year. At a starting price of around $45,000, it will target a much broader audience than the R1 luxury line, which costs over $100,000 for some versions. Importantly, Rivian has locked in costs through supplier contracts and expects the R2 to deliver stronger margins through lower material costs, higher volumes, and shared fixed expenses with its R1 and electric delivery van lines.

On the financial front, Rivian is backed by Amazon, which uses its delivery vans, and it still has more cash coming from Volkswagen if and when certain milestones are reached. It has also secured a $6.6 billion loan from the Department of Energy to help build a second U.S. plant. With $7.5 billion in cash and short-term investments, the company has plenty of capital to support the R2 launch. Management is targeting earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) breakeven by 2027, which seems like a realistic timeline if the R2 is successful.

Rivian is still a high-risk name, but it has the balance sheet, the partners, and the right vehicle strategy to grow into a profitable business.

Tesla is losing momentum

Tesla's core auto business has been heading in the wrong direction. Deliveries dropped double digits in each of the past two quarters, while auto revenue slid 16% in Q2. Profitability and cash flow have also taken a hit. Adjusted EPS dropped 23% last quarter, while operating cash flow fell 30% and free cash flow collapsed to just $146 million.

Meanwhile, its high gross margin regulatory credit sales were cut by more than half during the quarter. Musk has already warned investors that things could get worse once the EV tax credit disappears later this year.

Rather than focusing on improving its ailing auto business, Musk has instead continued to try to sell investors on Tesla's autonomous driving and robotics ambitions. The company has launched a small pilot robotaxi program in Austin, Texas, but the service is limited to a geofenced area and requires a Tesla employee as a safety driver. It's also already drawn scrutiny from local officials after several safety incidents.

Tesla is promising a rapid rollout of robotaxis across half the U.S. by year-end pending regulatory approvals, but the technology does not appear ready. Its decision to eschew lidar technology and use a camera-only approach remains controversial. This design saves costs, but the technology has struggled in some complex driving conditions, leading to questions around the safety of its approach. By comparison, Alphabet's Waymo robotaxi is far ahead, with years of experience operating paid, driverless rides in multiple cities.

Which EV stock wins?

Both Tesla and Rivian stocks carry their fair share of risk. Rivian is still unprofitable and faces near-term headwinds from tariffs and the loss of EV tax credits. Tesla, however, has a weakening auto business, a valuation that assumes big success in robotaxis and robotics, and a CEO whose actions have hurt the brand with many consumers.

Between the two, Rivian looks like the better investment. The company is improving its cost structure, expanding its market with the R2 SUV, and has the support of well-financed partners to help fund its growth. Tesla's stock, by contrast, is still priced as if its autonomous driving and robotics bets will pay off, even though it has yet to prove they can.

For investors willing to take on risk, Rivian is the better EV stock to own in my view.",https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/829926/gettyimages-2032424629.jpg,N,,2025-08-23 16:01:46.702450

This is the second time Trump officials have shut down an offshore wind project that was already under construction.
“This political move by the Trump administration will drive up the cost of electricity bills and contradicts everything the administration has told us.
Only a handful of offshore wind projects remain in development, a sharp departure from the many the Biden administration had approved.
The first project stopped by the Trump administration was Empire Wind off New York, which was halted in April.","The developers of Connecticut’s only offshore wind project, Revolution Wind, were ordered by the Trump administration late Friday to stop construction immediately.

The project is already 80% complete according to Ørsted, one of its developers.

It is designed to generate more than 700 megawatts of power — 305 megawatts to Connecticut and 400 to Rhode Island — and would provide power to the equivalent of about 350,000 homes.

This is the second time Trump officials have shut down an offshore wind project that was already under construction. President Donald J. Trump’s dislike of wind power is longstanding.

Friday afternoon, Ørsted received a letter from the U.S. Department of the Interior’s Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, BOEM, ordering it to “halt all ongoing activities related to the Revolution Wind Project on the outer continental shelf.” It went on to say that this was to allow time for BOEM to address concerns that have arisen since President Trump’s inauguration day order to stop any new wind projects on federal properties and review all those underway.

Another part of the letter stated that: “In particular, BOEM is seeking to address concerns related to the protection of national security interests of the United States.”

Earlier in the week, the U.S. Commerce Department revealed it had opened an investigation the week before “to determine the effects on the national security of imports of wind turbines and their parts and components.” That announcement indicated the results could trigger steep tariffs or quotas “to protect national security.”

BOEM did not respond to emails or phone calls Friday night seeking further information about what the specific security issues were for Revolution Wind or whether the two investigations were related.

The BOEM letter to Ørsted also threatened further “corrective action” if the company did not comply.

Revolution has created about 1200 direct jobs in Connecticut and Rhode Island. Eighty to 120 of them, depending on the activity level at any given time, are at State Pier in New London where much of the onshore work is being done.

The onshore transmission work for Revolution Wind began in the summer of 2023. All federal and state permits were secured in November 2023 and full construction began in early 2024. Presently all of the offshore foundations are in place and 45 of the 65 wind turbines are installed according to Ørsted. Work is slated to be completed by the end of 2026.

Connecticut Congressman Joe Courtney, whose district includes the State Pier, said the federal action puts approximately 200 jobs at risk. He called the administration’s claim of security concerns “particularly galling,” noting that in 2023, a record of decision by BOEM analyzed and addressed national security considerations for the project in coordination with the Department of Defense.

“That exhaustive review ensured that transit by Coast Guard vessels and U.S. Navy warships would not be hindered by the final placement of Revolution Wind towers,” Courtney said.

In a lengthy statement on its website Ørsted said it “is complying with the order and is taking appropriate steps to stop offshore activities, ensuring the safety of workers and the environment.”

The statement also said; “Ørsted is evaluating the potential financial implications of this development, considering a range of scenarios, including legal proceedings.”

So is Connecticut Attorney General William Tong, who said in a statement Friday night that “We are evaluating all legal options to protect Connecticut’s interests.”

“Trump wants to mothball billions of dollars in investment and cancel one of the best new sources of American-made, renewable energy. Trump and his enablers will own the resulting cost increases for ratepayers,” Tong said.

Reaction from the Lamont administration echoed this criticism.

“This political move by the Trump administration will drive up the cost of electricity bills and contradicts everything the administration has told us. It wastes years of state investment in renewable energy designed to diversify our energy supply and lower costs for families and businesses,” said Gov. Ned Lamont in a statement Saturday. “We are working closely with Rhode Island to save this project, because it represents exactly the kind of investment that reduces energy costs, strengthens regional production, and builds a more secure energy future, the very goals President Trump claims to support but undermines with this decision.”

Connecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal pointed to the potential impact on electric bills as well.

“The Trump Administration is canceling critical clean energy projects that would lower utility bills and have created good paying union jobs for our state’s workforce,” the Democratic senator said in a statement. “This arbitrary decision defies all logic and reason. Revolution Wind’s project was already well underway and employed hundreds of skilled tradesmen and women. This is a major setback for a critical project in Connecticut, and I will fight it.”

At the Conservation Law Foundation, which operates throughout New England, Kate Sinding Daly, the group’s senior vice president for law and policy said in a statement: “There is no evident legal basis for this, and it contravenes all common sense. Offshore wind represents the single most significant investment in clean, affordable energy for New England and this specious directive will not only deprive New Englanders of homegrown jobs but exposes us to higher energy bills and increasingly deadly extreme weather.”

Outrage was swift from a number of national groups, including the Natural Resources Defense Council. Kit Kennedy, the group’s managing director for power called halting Revolution Wind “a devastating attack on workers, on electricity customers, and on the investment climate in the U.S.”

“This administration has it exactly backwards. It’s trying to prop up clunky, polluting coal plants while doing all it can to halt the fastest growing energy sources of the future – solar and wind power.”

Both have been targeted directly by the Trump administration in the recent reconciliation budget legislation. Their valuable federal tax credits are being eliminated along with other actions that will make them less financially worthwhile.

Only a handful of offshore wind projects remain in development, a sharp departure from the many the Biden administration had approved. It had been assumed those under construction would be safe, but in July the Interior Department announced that it would consider cancelling projects that were challenged in court. The next day, the conservative Texas Public Policy Foundation filed suit on behalf of fishermen against a Massachusetts project – Vineyard Wind 1.

The first project stopped by the Trump administration was Empire Wind off New York, which was halted in April. That move was widely seen as a pressure tactic to get New York Governor Kathy Hochul to agree to allow a natural gas pipeline through the state. Hochul has said no deal was made.

That project was restarted after a month, but its developer, Equinor, came close to shutting it down and in the end the company indicated it cost them $1 billion.

Ørsted has had its own financial issues lately. Its stock nosedived earlier this month when the company said it would need more than $9 billion to help finance its only other offshore wind development, Sunrise Wind off Long Island.

American Clean Power CEO Jason Grumet posted online: “This is not the first time extreme partisan politics has derailed sound energy policy. The unfortunate message to investors is clear: the U.S. is no longer a reliable place for long-term energy investments,” he said.

Connecticut has had its own difficulties with offshore wind projects. A large, second project called Park City Wind was cancelled after inflation spurred by COVID and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine caused its developer, Avangrid, to pull out when its initial costs were no longer sustainable. In the last offshore wind solicitation at the end of the Biden administration, the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection opted to forgo any new projects.

In a statement Friday night, Commissioner Katie Dykes called the stop-work order on Revolution “deeply disappointing.”

“Losing this much capacity means higher costs and less reliability for families and businesses in Connecticut and across New England, at a time when we urgently need more affordable, domestically produced energy to strengthen our regional grid,” Dykes said. “Connecticut remains committed to an all-of-the-above approach to energy, of which offshore wind is a promising and important part.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Revolution-installed-turbine-082025.jpeg,N,,2025-08-23 15:01:03.660485

After already agreeing to purchase 5 million metric tons of gas per year from the first phase of the Port Arthur LNG project, ConocoPhillips on Thursday announced a 20-year partnership with Sempra Infrastructure to take an additional 4 million metric tons a year during the second phase of the site’s planned expansion.

The companies did not disclose financial details of the purchase and sale agreement.

The deal “advances our global LNG portfolio strategy as we build a flexible and reliable LNG supply network to meet growing energy demand,” Conoco Phillips CEP Ryan Lance said in a statement.

Still under construction, Sempra Infrastructure’s Port Arthur LNG project will house two large storage tanks and two processing units, called “trains” in the parlance of the industry, that enable specially built tankers to ship some 13.5 metric tons of liquefied gas to destinations around the world each year.

Commercial operations are scheduled to begin in 2027 for the first train and 2028 for the second.

Phase 2 of the project expects to add two more trains to the facility, nearly doubling its export capacity.

Sempra Infrastructure is lining up commitments from banks and financial institutions to underwrite the costs of the buildout, and the company says it plans to announce a final investment decision on Phase 2 later this year.

“This next phase reflects both companies’ shared view of the opportunity to connect American producers of natural gas with growing markets overseas,” Sempra CEO Jeff Martin said, “while also driving economic growth and job creation here at home.”

Sempra has become a major player in the LNG sphere, as countries around the world look to use natural gas rather than coal to help power their electric grids. Markets in Asia are a frequent destination. So is Europe, where U.S.-produced natural gas acts an alternative to gas from Russia.

Sempra Infrastructure is already majority owner of the $10.5 billion Cameron LNG facility on the coast of Louisiana that opened in August 2020. The company is also adding an export component to an existing LNG terminal near Ensenada, Mexico, called Energía Costa Azul, which is expected to be finished by spring of 2026.

Environmental groups oppose LNG because of the amount of methane emitted by natural gas. They say exports extend the world’s reliance on fossil fuels, rather than transitioning to renewable energy sources.

Once fully operational, they said, the facility would produce enough electricity to power more than 350,000 homes in Rhode Island and Connecticut.
Just last week, Orsted announced it needs to raise an additional $9.4 billion to shore up its finances to complete both Revolution Wind and Sunrise Wind, another large offshore wind project near Long Island.
The move comes as the Trump administration’s opposition to offshore wind is exacerbating a pre-existing downturn in the sector.
Among those crying foul over the bureau’s action are the members of the Oceantic Network, a trade group of the offshore energy industry.","WASHINGTON — The developers of Revolution Wind, a $4 billion wind farm off the coast of Rhode Island, have been ordered to “halt all ongoing activities” pending a review to address unspecified concerns raised by the Department of Interior.

In a letter to Rob Keiser, head of Asset Management for Orsted North America, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management cites “national security interests” and the “prevention of interference with reasonable uses of the exclusive economic zone” as its reasons for issuing the stop-work order.

The 65-turbine project, which is located about 15 nautical miles southeast of Point Judith, Rhode Island, and 12 nautical miles southwest of Martha’s Vineyard, received all necessary permits from the Biden administration after nine years of agency review.

It received its construction and operations plan approval letter on Nov. 17, 2023.

According to company officials, the project is 80% complete, with all offshore foundations and 45 out of 65 wind turbines installed. The wind farm was on track to begin producing electricity next spring.

Once fully operational, they said, the facility would produce enough electricity to power more than 350,000 homes in Rhode Island and Connecticut.

The letter from Matthew Giacona, the acting director of BOEM, tells Orsted it “may not resume activities” until the agency has completed a review of the project.

In a statement, Orsted acknowledged it had received the letter, and is “evaluating all options to resolve the matter expeditiously.”

“This includes engagement with relevant permitting agencies for any necessary clarification or resolution as well as through potential legal proceedings, with the aim being to proceed with continued project construction,” the statement said.

Just last week, Orsted announced it needs to raise an additional $9.4 billion to shore up its finances to complete both Revolution Wind and Sunrise Wind, another large offshore wind project near Long Island.

The move comes as the Trump administration’s opposition to offshore wind is exacerbating a pre-existing downturn in the sector.

Among those crying foul over the bureau’s action are the members of the Oceantic Network, a trade group of the offshore energy industry.

According to the group, Revolution Wind has “sparked investments in Louisiana and New England shipyards, the purchase of export cables from a South Carolina factory, and spurred a steel supply chain that crossed New York and created hundreds of union jobs in Providence, Rhode Island.”

In a statement, Liz Burdock, the CEO of the Oceantic Network, accused the Trump administration of taking an “unlawful action against a fully permitted offshore wind project under active construction.”

“This dramatic action further erodes investor confidence in the U.S. market across all industries and undermines progress on shared national priorities — shipyard revitalization, steel and port investments, and energy dominance,” Burdock said.

“In fact, halting work on Revolution Wind will drive up energy costs for consumers, idle Gulf Coast vessel operators that have invested hundreds of millions of dollars in new or retrofitted vessels, and jeopardize the livelihoods of union workers,” she continued.

Burdock said offshore wind is a “shovel-ready, reliable and affordable energy source ready to power America’s leadership and independence.”

“Operational data from the nation’s first commercial-scale offshore wind project demonstrate energy production and reliability rates on par with traditional sources — performing even better during severe weather and winter months — saving ratepayers in the Northeast hundreds of millions of dollars,” she continued.

“The Oceantic Network and the hundreds of American suppliers that make up its membership urges the Department of the Interior to reverse course immediately and allow this project to move forward,” Burdock said.

Connecticut Attorney General William Tong, a Democrat, also weighed in, saying his office is “evaluating all legal options to protect Connecticut’s interests.”

“Trump wants to mothball billions of dollars in investment and cancel one of the best new sources of American-made, renewable energy,” the state attorney general said. “Trump and his enablers will own the resulting cost increases for ratepayers.”

In related news, last week, the Commerce Department opened a trade investigation into imported wind turbines and their components.

A federal filing revealed the investigation is looking at internationally-made wind turbines under a Section 232, a legal provision that allows the president to apply tariffs to foreign products if their imports threaten national security.

Trump has previously used the provision to slap significant tariffs on aluminum, cars, copper, and steel.

He is reportedly also considering its use on semiconductors and pharmaceuticals, and now, wind turbines.

The acting director of the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Matthew Giacona, wrote in a letter to one of the developers, a Danish firm called Ørsted, that the government was halting work on the almost-finished project in order to ""address concerns related to the protection of national security interests of the United States."" The project is also being developed by Global Infrastructure Partners.

The order to stop work on the Revolution Wind project is the latest move by the Trump administration targeting the country's renewable energy industry. President Trump, a longtime critic of the wind industry, in January issued a moratorium on new development of offshore wind projects. The Internal Revenue Service recently put out new guidance that makes it harder for companies building wind and solar projects to qualify for federal tax incentives. And the Commerce Department is investigating whether imports of wind turbines and their components threaten national security.

Ørsted said in a statement that it is ""evaluating all options to resolve the matter expeditiously,"" including legal action.

Revolution Wind is located in federal waters 15 miles south of Rhode Island. Construction started in 2023, and the project has been slated to begin sending power to homes and businesses in Rhode Island and Connecticut starting next year.

""Any pause or uncertainty at this stage could ripple across jobs, contracts, and communities already benefiting from the project,"" Erik Milito, president of the National Ocean Industries Association, a trade group whose members include wind project developers as well as oil and gas companies, said in a statement.

""Today, the U.S. has only one fully operational large-scale offshore wind project producing power,"" Milito said. ""That is not enough to meet America's rising energy needs. We need more energy of all types, including oil and gas, wind, and new and emerging technologies.""

The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management didn't respond to messages seeking comment.

Industry analysts have said that limiting renewable energy development amid rising electricity demand threatens to drive up power prices across the country.

""This is not the first time extreme partisan politics has derailed sound energy policy,"" Jason Grumet, chief executive of American Clean Power, an industry group, said in a statement responding to the Trump administration's stop-work order to Revolution Wind. ""The unfortunate message to investors is clear: the U.S. is no longer a reliable place for long-term energy investments.""

In April, the Interior Department halted work on an offshore wind project near the coast of Long Island. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum wrote in a letter to the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management at the time that approval of the project, called Empire Wind, ""was rushed through by the prior administration without sufficient analysis.""

Construction on Empire Wind resumed in May when the Trump administration lifted the stop-work order. But the disruption was costly for the project's developer, a Norwegian company called Equinor. The firm recently cut the value of its investment by almost $1 billion, mainly because of ""the changes in regulations for future offshore wind projects in the U.S.,"" Torgrim Reitan, Equinor's chief financial officer, said on an earnings call in July.

""For the second time, the Trump Administration has taken unlawful action against a fully permitted offshore wind project under active construction — this time one that is nearly 80% complete,"" Liz Burdock, chief executive of the Oceantic Network, an advocacy group for offshore wind, said in a statement about the Revolution Wind project.

""This dramatic action further erodes investor confidence in the U.S. market across all industries and undermines progress on shared national priorities — shipyard revitalization, steel and port investments, and energy dominance,"" Burdock said. ""In fact, halting work on Revolution Wind will drive up energy costs for consumers, idle Gulf Coast vessel operators that have invested hundreds of millions of dollars in new or retrofitted vessels, and jeopardize the livelihoods of union workers.""

“When they talk about Iowa, how much electricity they produce from wind power in Iowa, it’s not all consumed in Iowa,” Wright continued.
Wright challenged this line of thinking, noting that wind and solar power are intermittent, meaning that they do not produce power around the clock.
The secretary claimed that, without proper battery technology, wind and solar energy infrastructure is essentially “worthless” when it is dark and when the wind isn’t blowing.
Just this week, Trump promised not to issue any new approvals for wind and solar projects on farmland.","The secretary’s remarks came just days after Trump escalated his criticism of wind and solar, calling the green energy alternatives “THE SCAM OF THE CENTURY” in a social media post. His claim was disputed by clean energy advocates, who have argued that some of the states with the cheapest electricity have built large amounts of wind and solar power.

“The President’s comments are correct, but the situation is more complicated than that,” Wright said, adding that the discussion needs to have a “country-wide” focus and not zero in on individual states.

He pointed to states such as Iowa and Oklahoma, which have some of the largest shares of renewable energy growth and the smallest electricity price hikes among all states. Wright said their rate hikes have remained low because the states did not close any fossil fuel power plants, leaving that infrastructure in place while adding new wind and solar.

“They generate [wind energy] in those states, but most of it isn’t consumed in those states. They have land. They’re pro-development. They do generate power, and they sell it. They sell it onto the whole grid, not just in their own state,” the secretary said, referring to the fact that Iowa is a part of the Midcontinent Independent System Operator’s grid and sells its energy directly into that multi-state market.

“When they talk about Iowa, how much electricity they produce from wind power in Iowa, it’s not all consumed in Iowa,” Wright continued. “So when you look at [a] state, you’re just looking at a microcosm of a grid.”

The debate over renewable energy’s role in energy prices comes as electricity prices have continued to rise nationwide for the last two and a half years. During his campaign, Trump promised to lower energy bills for Americans, but he has yet to see prices drop. In July, the Bureau of Labor Statistics estimated that electricity prices rose by 5.5% year over year, more than double the rate of inflation.

Wind and solar proponents have cited Iowa and other red-leaning states such as South Dakota and Kansas as proof that there is no causation between generating power from renewable sources and high electricity prices.

American Clean Power, a renewable trade association, has instead claimed that states with the lowest share of renewables in their energy mix are experiencing higher prices.

The group has called on the administration to harness wind and solar, which are widely considered to be the fastest-deployed energy resources, particularly since natural gas and nuclear facilities can take years to build.

“The only significant source of electricity that can be added to the grid during the Trump administration are renewable resources,” ACP CEO Jason Grumet told the Washington Examiner.

“Going forward, in the early 2030s, we will start to see more natural gas — which we need — and by the end of the decade, hopefully we’ll start to see advanced nuclear — which we need,” he added, before criticizing the government for imposing additional hurdles for wind and solar deployment.

“But if the administration truly wants an energy dominance strategy that allows us to power growing manufacturing and data centers, they need to stop actively blocking deployment of renewable power,” Grumet said.

Wright challenged this line of thinking, noting that wind and solar power are intermittent, meaning that they do not produce power around the clock.

The secretary claimed that, without proper battery technology, wind and solar energy infrastructure is essentially “worthless” when it is dark and when the wind isn’t blowing.

“As you deploy more renewables, you’re basically building a whole separate grid,” Wright said.

“If you take a grid or a system and grow the renewables penetration, you will raise the price of it. The president’s 100% correct in that,” he added.

Wind and solar projects have faced the ire of the administration since Day One, through numerous executive orders and agency actions.

While Wright has previously acknowledged renewables can be beneficial in some cases, the administration has broadly sought to stymie future development for wind and solar projects under the second Trump administration.

ANN ARBOR—Standing beneath a federally funded solar canopy at Veterans Memorial Park on Thursday, US Rep. Debbie Dingell (D-Ann Arbor) delivered a blunt warning to Michiganders: President Donald Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill” isn’t lowering costs—it’s driving them up.

“Michigan families are going to see higher utility bills because of these policies, at a time when energy prices are skyrocketing,” Dingell told reporters. “Cutting solar [federal tax incentives] means fewer low-income households can access affordable, renewable power. Michiganders are going to be saddled with higher utility costs and it’s going to hurt economic development.”

With coal plants kept online, solar and wind projects scrapped, and federal tax credits stripped away, Dingell said Republican-led rollbacks on renewable energy policies are already making life more expensive for Michiganders, as well as stalling progress toward a clean energy future.

Utility bills are up. Jobs are down. And it’s likely going to get worse from here, she said.

Higher bills, fewer jobs

The press conference—organized by the Michigan League of Conservation Voters—brought together local leaders, clean energy advocates, and labor officials to sound the alarm about Trump’s “dirty” energy policies and the Republican-backed budget bill that’s enabling them.

“Trump promised to cut utility costs by 50%. Instead, he’s hiking costs, destroying jobs, and threatening Michigan’s auto industry by stripping away electric vehicle tax credits,” Dingell said. “The rollback of clean energy progress is going to raise costs. People’s utility bills are going up.”

The timing underscored her point. As advocates gathered in Ann Arbor this week, the Trump administration announced it was extending the life of Consumers Energy’s outdated J.H. Campbell coal plant—again. The West Michigan facility was slated to close in May—a move expected to save ratepayers $600 million by 2040. Instead, Trump ordered it to stay open another 90 days, a decision that’s already cost $30 million and could reach $100 million.

“Every day it remains open means more pollution in our air and higher energy costs,” said Lisa Wozniak, director of the Michigan League of Conservation Voters, in a statement on Thursday. “Our bills are already too high, and Trump’s reckless energy policies are making it worse.”

Bentley Johnson, federal government affairs director at the League of Conservation Voters, said the repeal of tax credits alone will raise household utility bills by up to $110 a year starting next year—and up to $400 within a decade. Federally funded projects on the chopping block include solar arrays at a senior housing center in Oakland County and at the Hillsdale Municipal Airport.

“We’re losing so many tools that help drive down costs, make people’s homes more comfortable, make them healthier,” Johnson said. “At a time when we should be doubling down on clean energy investment, the Trump administration is taking us in the opposite direction.”

Jobs on the line

Michigan’s clean energy sector employs more than 127,000 people—the sixth-most in the country. But that progress is at risk. John Richter of the Great Lakes Renewable Energy Association said Trump’s policies will raise the cost of solar projects by 37% and wind by 48%.

By peeling back federal incentives and increasing the cost of renewable energy projects, fewer Michiganders will pursue them—and that will ultimately drive up electric rates, exacerbate the climate crisis, and slow the state’s transition to cleaner forms of energy, Richter explained.

“Our electric rates will go up even faster than they have been,” he said. “These higher electric rates hit household budgets directly, and they also act as a damper on economic expansion.”

Jonathan Smith, chief deputy director of the Michigan Department of Labor and Economic Opportunity, also noted that Michigan had been on track to create at least 750 new jobs through the now-canceled Solar for All program. Those jobs, he said, are no longer coming to fruition.

“These repeals have devastating consequences—not just for the environment, but for the pocketbooks of Michiganders and their families who are no longer going to have access to these good-paying jobs,” Smith said.

Ann Arbor Sustainability Director Missy Stults also reminded the crowd of what’s at stake.

She pointed to the solar canopy above them—funded through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law—as proof that federal investments work. The project has already saved residents millions in utility costs and made critical facilities like fire stations more resilient to outages, she said.

“Every home and business that gets solar sees bill reductions. We’ve helped people save $24 million in lifetime energy costs,” Stults said. “That’s real money that stays in our economy. But now, because of decisions being made in DC, families across Michigan are going to pay more.”

Dingell’s call to action

For Dingell, the fight for cleaner forms of energy is both personal and political.

She said she’s been struggling with asthma worsened by wildfire smoke from Canada—a reminder, she said, that climate change is real and already harming Michiganders’ health.

“Michigan has been a leader on clean energy and we need to keep it that way,” she said.

Dingell told The ‘Gander that Congress can’t undo all of Trump’s damage, but Michigan voters can make a big difference by electing new leadership in the next statewide election.

“Elections have consequences. The next election is November of 2026. When we win, we are going to have to move very quickly,” Dingell said. “But we can’t do this political ping-pong ball back and forth. The American people have to speak up and speak out. You can’t just be quiet.”

Trump continues to bellow about the “energy dominance” thing, which clearly means helping fossil fuels and hurting the green alternatives.","President Donald Trump’s energy policy is utterly screwed up — if you assume America’s interests, and not pleasing his fossil fuel friends, are the objective.

This came to the fore when trade adviser Peter Navarro hollered at India for buying Russian oil. Navarro called the purchases “opportunistic and deeply corrosive” of efforts to isolate Russia and curb Vladimir Putin’s war machine. Oh, is Trump isolating Putin? Could fool us.

Navarro is right that Russia’s oil wealth is funding Putin’s savage attacks on Ukraine. If so, then wouldn’t it be in our interests to speed the move away from fossil fuels? That’s the path Western Europe took shortly after the Russian tanks rolled into Ukraine.

On the contrary, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum is now demanding that projects “related to wind and solar energy facilities” go through new layers of political review. In other words, slow or kill them. Energy Secretary Chris Wright has canceled a federal loan guarantee to build an $11 billion transmission line through the Heartland. The Grain Belt Express was to send electricity generated by Kansas wind farms across four states. The states involved — Kansas, Missouri, Illinois and Indiana — had all approved the project. For reasons easy to guess, Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley sided with Trump against the venture.

Invenergy, the Grain Belt Express developer, called Hawley’s opposition “bizarre.” Writing on X, the company accused Hawley of being against an infrastructure project “aligned with the President’s energy dominance agenda.”

As though Trump has an energy dominance agenda, as opposed to a slogan. Does he believe that, well into the 21st century, fossil fuels are the golden-brick road to energy dominance? If he does, that would be most concerning of all.

Trump clearly hasn’t read China’s plan for “energy dominance.” China now dominates in electric vehicles, solar, wind and batteries. Electricity now accounts for 30 percent of its energy consumption versus only 20 percent in the U.S. The Financial Times reports that China is on its way to becoming the first “electrostate.”

Electric vehicles represent both the present and future of transport. Trump is actively handing the EV market to China. He started by pushing Republicans to kill federal tax credits incentivizing Americans to buy or lease electric vehicles. Ford CEO Jim Farley recently called China’s rise in the EV market the “most humbling experience” of his career. “Their cost, their quality of their vehicles is far superior to what I see in the West.”

Also gone are tax credits for wind and solar power. As a result, dozens of EV or clean energy projects — investments totaling $27 billion — have been canceled.

Over half of Iowa’s electricity now comes from wind power. And on sunny and windy days in Texas, wind and solar power can supply over 60 percent of the grid’s fuel mix.

Trump continues to bellow about the “energy dominance” thing, which clearly means helping fossil fuels and hurting the green alternatives. He also goes on about cheaper gas, which is not what the oil business wants for obvious reasons.

More than 10,000 annual pre-term births are attributable to fine particulate matter from oil and gas, the authors found, also linking 216,000 annual childhood-onset asthma cases to the sector’s nitrogen dioxide emissions and 1,610 annual lifetime cancer cases to its hazardous air pollutants.
They plugged that data into a computer model to track pollution from each source, and used epidemiological and health data to track the adverse impacts of those emissions.

More than 10,000 annual pre-term births are attributable to fine particulate matter from oil and gas, the authors found, also linking 216,000 annual childhood-onset asthma cases to the sector’s nitrogen dioxide emissions and 1,610 annual lifetime cancer cases to its hazardous air pollutants.

The highest number of impacts are seen in California, Texas, New York, Pennsylvania and New Jersey, while the per-capita incidences are highest in New Jersey, Washington DC, New York, California and Maryland.

The analysis by researchers at University College London and the Stockholm Environment Institute is the first to examine the health impacts – and unequal health burdens – caused by every stage of the oil and gas supply chain, from exploration to end use.

“We’ve long known that these communities are exposed to such levels of inequitable exposure as well as health burden,” said Karn Vohra, a postdoctoral research fellow in geography at University College London, who led the paper. “We were able to just put numbers to what that looks like.”

While Indigenous and Hispanic populations are most affected by pollution from exploration, extraction, transportation and storage, Black and Asian populations are most affected by emissions from processing, refining, manufacturing, distribution and usage.

Though the latter set of activities is responsible for less air pollution overall than the former, the study shows they cause the most unequal health burden, with impacts concentrated in majority-Black areas including southern Louisiana’s “Cancer Alley” and eastern Texas.

“What makes the study so valuable is how it dissects health impacts across the whole life cycle of oil and gas – from where it comes out of the ground to where it is combusted,” Timothy Donaghy, research director for the environmental group Greenpeace USA and author of previous research on the racially uneven burdens of fossil fuel pollution. “As many studies have found before, these health burdens are not shared equally – a prime example of fossil fuel racism in action.”

For the analysis, published in Science Advances on Friday, the authors developed an inventory of each stage of oil and gas production and use, with data from the federal government and the University of Colorado Boulder. They plugged that data into a computer model to track pollution from each source, and used epidemiological and health data to track the adverse impacts of those emissions.

These disproportionate impacts are not inexplicable; rather, they are attributable to historic policies such as redlining – a discriminatory mortgage appraisal practice used after the Great Depression by the US government – and high rates of permitting for oil and gas processing plants in close proximity to Black communities.

Oil and gas are responsible for a major share of all air pollution-attributable health impacts in the US, the authors also found: one in five pre-term births and adult deaths linked to fine particulate pollution are from the sector, the authors found, while a stunning 90% of new childhood asthma cases tied to nitrogen dioxide pollution are from oil and gas.

The study is based on data from 2017, the most recent year of complete data available. Between that year and 2023, US oil and gas production has increased by 40% and consumption by 8%, meaning the estimates are probably highly conservative.

The research comes as the Trump administration works to boost fossil fuel production and suppress renewable energy production.

“Given the reckless deregulation being pushed by Trump’s EPA and the president’s call to ‘drill, baby, drill’, this new study should be a flashing red warning light for the nation,” said Donaghy.

Eloise Marais, a University College London professor of geography and study co-author, said she hoped the study was “picked up by the kinds of community leaders and advocacy groups that are pushing for exposure to cleaner air”.

“If there was a move away from reliance on oil and gas, we would experience the climate change benefits 50, 100, 200 years from today because the greenhouse gases stay in the atmosphere so long,” she said. “But communities would experience the health benefits immediately.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a507531a55ca882affdb1c4315f9729cb9bf85d6/562_0_5624_4504/master/5624.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=95da076d2787baf8ebe31e0fee14a89c",N,,2025-08-23 14:03:34.311645

AMARILLO, Texas — In the windswept plains of the Texas Panhandle, where cattle once defined economic prosperity, a new kind of infrastructure is taking shape—one that could fundamentally reshape how America powers its digital future.

Fermi America's announcement today of an 11-gigawatt private energy grid represents more than ambitious corporate planning. It signals the emergence of a parallel power economy, where tech giants and energy developers are constructing vast, self-contained electrical systems to bypass the increasingly strained public grid that has served America for over a century.

The scale is staggering. This single facility would generate enough electricity to power roughly 8 million homes—larger than the peak demand of many individual states. Yet it will serve primarily artificial intelligence computing centers, the power-hungry engines driving America's technological supremacy in an increasingly competitive global landscape.

When Public Infrastructure Meets Private Ambition

The partnership announced between Fermi America, engineering firm Parkhill, and construction giant Lee Lewis Construction reflects a broader recalibration occurring across the American energy landscape. Data centers, particularly those serving AI workloads, now consume approximately 4-4.5% of U.S. electricity—a figure projected to potentially triple by 2028 according to Department of Energy scenarios.

(Projected U.S. data center electricity consumption and capacity signals tied to AI workloads; figures reflect recent analyses and forecasts and illustrate a steep upward trajectory from mid‑2020s baselines into the 2030s.)

Traditional utility interconnection processes, designed for predictable industrial loads, are buckling under requests for unprecedented amounts of instantaneous power. Interconnection queues now stretch years into the future, while the specialized equipment required—massive transformers, gas turbines, high-voltage switchgear—faces backlogs extending 5-7 years.

Did you know? An electricity interconnection queue is the grid’s waiting list where new power projects—like solar, wind, batteries, or large loads—undergo engineering studies to ensure they can connect safely and identify any transmission upgrades and costs; because applications surged far faster than grid capacity and planning, many regions face years-long backlogs, with “zombie” projects that never advance clogging the line, prompting reforms such as cluster studies and “first-ready, first-served” rules to speed up approvals, reduce speculative entries, and unlock more clean energy.

This infrastructure bottleneck has created what energy analysts describe as a ""shadow grid"" economy. Major technology companies are increasingly bypassing public utilities entirely, opting instead for dedicated generation facilities that can deliver power on accelerated timelines.

Microsoft's 20-year agreement with Constellation Energy to restart Three Mile Island's Unit 1, providing 835 megawatts exclusively for data centers, exemplifies this trend. Amazon Web Services secured an even larger commitment—1.92 gigawatts from the Susquehanna nuclear facility in Pennsylvania through 2042. Oracle and OpenAI are developing over 5 gigawatts of capacity across multiple U.S. sites, including a flagship facility in Abilene, Texas.

The Texas Advantage: Policy, Geography, and Ambition Converge

Texas has emerged as the epicenter of this private grid revolution, offering a combination of regulatory flexibility, abundant land, and political support that other states struggle to match. The state's recently passed House Bill 14 created a $350 million Advanced Nuclear Development Fund and established a dedicated nuclear office—explicit signals of official support for next-generation energy infrastructure.

The ERCOT grid, Texas's independent power market, has demonstrated greater willingness to accommodate large, behind-the-meter installations compared to more regulated markets in other regions. State policymakers have publicly discussed scenarios where electricity demand could nearly double, driven primarily by data center growth and related industrial development.

Did you know? Texas runs most of its own electric grid through ERCOT, a nonprofit system operator that manages power for about 90% of the state and over 26 million customers. It’s largely isolated from the Eastern and Western U.S. grids—connected only by a few DC ties—so ERCOT balances supply and demand in real time within Texas, operating an energy-only market and dispatching power across tens of thousands of miles of transmission lines without owning any generation or wires. This unique setup, overseen by the Public Utility Commission of Texas, has helped Texas rapidly add wind, solar, and battery storage—but it also limits the state’s ability to import power during extreme weather, which can amplify reliability and price risks.

Fermi America's choice of Amarillo reflects careful strategic positioning. The location sits adjacent to the Department of Energy's Pantex facility and benefits from existing high-voltage transmission infrastructure. More importantly, it provides access to the Ogallala Aquifer—a critical consideration for facilities requiring substantial water resources for cooling.

The company's local partnerships signal an understanding that mega-scale infrastructure projects require more than favorable regulations. Parkhill, founded in 1944 and headquartered in Lubbock, brings seven decades of engineering expertise to the project. Lee Lewis Construction, which has appeared on Engineering News-Record's Top 400 Contractors list for over 40 consecutive years, provides the construction management capabilities essential for delivering projects of this complexity.

Nuclear Renaissance Meets Digital Demand

Perhaps most significantly, Fermi America's plans incorporate four Westinghouse AP1000 nuclear reactors, potentially providing 4.4 gigawatts of carbon-free baseload power. This nuclear component distinguishes the project from purely gas-fired alternatives and positions it within the broader resurgence of American nuclear energy.

The AP1000 design, already certified by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, offers a pathway to large-scale nuclear deployment that bypasses some of the regulatory uncertainties that have plagued the industry. However, recent experience with AP1000 construction—most notably at Plant Vogtle in Georgia—demonstrates that even certified designs face substantial execution challenges. The Georgia project ultimately required approximately 15 years and over $30 billion to complete.

Industry analysts suggest that Fermi America's near-term development will likely emphasize natural gas generation and energy storage, with nuclear components representing a longer-term expansion phase. This phased approach reflects practical realities around equipment availability, regulatory timelines, and capital requirements.

Investment Implications and Market Dynamics

For sophisticated investors, the Fermi announcement represents both opportunity and cautionary signal. The immediate value creation lies in the supply chain serving these massive infrastructure projects—high-voltage transformers, gas turbines, specialized cooling systems, and project finance structures.

Equipment manufacturers face unprecedented order backlogs. General Electric Vernova, Siemens Energy, and Mitsubishi are experiencing multiyear delays for large gas turbines, while transformer manufacturers struggle with both supply chain constraints and skilled labor shortages. Companies that have secured early positions in these supply chains may significantly outperform broader market expectations.

The financing requirements for these projects create opportunities in specialized project finance and infrastructure debt markets. Facilities of this scale require innovative capital structures that balance construction risk, operational performance, and long-term power purchase agreements with technology companies.

However, execution risks remain substantial. Water resources in the Texas Panhandle face increasing stress, particularly during drought cycles. Even closed-loop cooling systems require significant water makeup, and public opposition to large industrial water users has intensified across the Southwest.

Regulatory evolution presents another uncertainty. While Texas currently maintains a supportive stance toward private grid development, cost-shift concerns among traditional utility customers could prompt policy adjustments. If private facilities avoid contributing to transmission infrastructure costs while maintaining grid interconnection rights, regulators may impose new charges or operating restrictions.

The Broader Energy Transformation

The scale of announced private grid projects suggests that America is entering a period of fundamental energy infrastructure transformation comparable to the rural electrification programs of the 1930s or the interstate highway system of the 1950s.

Beyond individual project announcements, this trend reflects the inadequacy of existing institutional arrangements to meet the demands of a rapidly digitalizing economy. Traditional utility planning processes, designed around incremental load growth and centralized generation, are proving insufficient for the concentrated, high-density demands of artificial intelligence computing.

Geothermal energy represents another emerging component of this transformation. Google's partnership with Fervo Energy, scaling from initial 3.5-megawatt pilots to 115 megawatts in Nevada, demonstrates the potential for 24/7 carbon-free energy sources that complement solar and storage.

Looking Forward: Risks and Opportunities

The success of projects like Fermi America's Amarillo facility will likely determine whether private grids become a permanent feature of the American energy landscape or represent a temporary response to current infrastructure constraints.

Water availability will prove critical. The Ogallala Aquifer, while substantial, faces long-term depletion pressures that could intensify with multiple large industrial users. Technological solutions—closed-loop systems, air-side economization, advanced cooling technologies—may mitigate but not eliminate these constraints. Historical water level changes in the Ogallala Aquifer, illustrating the long-term depletion trend.

Time PeriodAverage Water-Level Change (feet)Change in Recoverable Water in Storage (acre-feet)Predevelopment (approx. 1950) to 2015-15.8-273.2 million2013 to 2015-0.6-10.7 millionPredevelopment (approx. 1950) to 2019-16.5-286.4 million2017 to 2019+0.1+1.6 million

Equipment supply chains represent the most immediate bottleneck. Companies that can secure delivery slots for critical components—particularly large transformers and gas turbines—will determine project timelines more than regulatory processes or financing availability.

The broader question involves system integration. As private grids proliferate, their interaction with public utilities during emergency conditions, maintenance periods, and demand fluctuations will require new regulatory frameworks and operating procedures.

For investors positioned in the infrastructure value chain—from specialized engineering firms to equipment manufacturers to project developers—the current environment offers potentially exceptional returns for those who can navigate execution complexities and regulatory evolution.

The age of private power has arrived, reshaping not only how America generates electricity, but who controls the infrastructure that will determine technological leadership in the decades ahead. Fermi America's 11-gigawatt vision may prove ambitious, but the trend it represents appears both irreversible and accelerating.

Officials have unveiled plans for the city's first community-driven, freight-focused electric vehicle charging depot, which will be paired with a welcome center and workforce development hub in Hunts Point in the South Bronx.

The project, led by NYC-based MN8 Energy and announced by the New York City Economic Development Corp., will bring more than 40 light-, medium-, and heavy-duty EV charging stations to the Hunts Point Food Distribution Center, one of the largest in the world.

The development will also include 10,000 square feet of indoor space dedicated to shared community areas, commercial businesses, and job training programs. The goal is to cut pollution from diesel trucks, improve air quality, and create new ""green collar"" jobs where they're needed most.

""For decades, the Hunts Point community has been unjustly oversaturated by air pollution due to truck traffic,"" Bronx Borough President Vanessa L. Gibson said. Swapping diesel engines for clean EVs could greatly reduce harmful air pollution, helping improve the public's respiratory health and lowering noise pollution. And by modernizing freight transport, the project could lower operational costs for businesses, savings that may reach consumers.

""This isn't just about charging trucks — it's about creating opportunity and jobs, improving air quality, and building a more equitable clean energy future,"" said Alan Dowdell, head of distributed energy solutions at MN8 Energy. Elijah Hutchinson, executive director of the Mayor's Office of Climate and Environmental Justice, called the effort a ""shining example"" of how environmental justice and economic development can go hand in hand.

The initiative also builds on the Bronx Is Breathing program, which recently rolled out the city's first electric refuse truck. Similar clean-tech solutions — such as Sysco's adding electric freight trucks to its fleet and NineDot's clean energy projects in Brooklyn — are already proving that cleaner infrastructure can be good for both quality of life and business.

""When we talk about improving quality of life for generations of New Yorkers to come, you only have to look at what's happening in Hunts Point as a shining example of what's possible in neighborhoods around the city,"" Hutchinson added.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/wk1zQO1_ImKTOaamQEgLNw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_cool_down_737/da3e6abf9a14d407dfce3a351107d6a1,N,,2025-08-23 14:03:48.087954

The U.S. government announced opposition this month to a United Nations (UN) plan that would establish global carbon emission standards and fees for the shipping industry. The proposal, called the “Net-Zero Framework,” was approved by a committee of the UN’s International Maritime Organization (IMO) in April and will face a full vote in October. If adopted, it would take effect in 2027, imposing costs on ships that exceed certain emission limits and offering incentives for lower-emitting vessels. U.S. officials say the plan would significantly raise costs for American consumers and businesses.

In a joint statement, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, and Energy Secretary Chris Wright said the nation will not support measures that increase domestic shipping expenses and may respond if the proposal is enacted.

They said in the joint release, “Whatever its stated goals, the proposed framework is effectively a global carbon tax on Americans levied by an unaccountable UN organization. These fuel standards would conveniently benefit China by requiring the use of expensive fuels unavailable at global scale. These standards would also preclude the use of proven technologies that fuel global shipping fleets, including lower emissions options where U.S. industry leads such as liquified natural gas (LNG) and biofuels.“

The secretaries continued, “Under this framework, ships will have to pay fees for failing to meet unattainable fuel standards and emissions targets. These fees will drive up energy and transportation and leisure cruise costs. Even small vessels would incur millions of dollars in fees, directly driving up costs for American consumers.“

The administration stated the decision is part of a broader approach to limit international control over U.S. energy policy. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin is also reviewing existing climate regulations, projecting substantial cost savings if certain rules are rolled back.

State incentives, called TECH Clean California Incentives, launched about a month ago and will run out quickly.","You may be wondering, when do the electrification incentives run out? Well, in a sense, they never run out. The climate is warming, which is as good a reason as any to reduce your use of gas. While it’s been a cool summer in coastal California, those of you who visited Europe for vacation have gotten a direct sense of this. It is also likely that gasoline prices will be going up. The Energy Institute at UC Berkeley produces a terrific blog, and the latest talks about how the closure of two California-based oil refineries will affect gasoline prices in the state. It is less clear what will happen with natural gas prices in Palo Alto (natural gas is used to heat many homes here), but the fact that the current proposal has gas bills going up by 20% on average cannot be reassuring. These incentives to electrify have no expiration date.

However, there are even more incentives to electrify, $1000s of dollars worth, some of which do have an expiration date. You can learn more about them on the city’s residential electrification site, or by watching this informative video made by several local experts in home electrification. But I will also try to summarize some of the information here for you.

City of Palo Alto Incentives

First of all, the city has some substantial incentives available. There is no expiration date on these, though at some point the money will run out.

On top of this, the city is offering meaningful assistance for residents who want to electrify. There is a super easy program to install heat pump water heaters at low cost. The city’s installers are very experienced with these installations and they use good equipment.

In addition, Palo Alto has partnered with QuitCarbon to help people who are looking to go beyond water heaters, or who have circumstances that make it challenging for them to replace their gas appliances (e.g., an electrical panel that is maxed out). These consultants are on top of the fast-moving field of home electrification, and they know lots of ways to help homeowners find the equipment they want while also saving money. For example, the QuitCarbon folks know many techniques for getting more out of an existing electric panel, they have experience with different configurations for heating water (e.g., for those of you who have instant-hot gas heaters), and they know the ins and outs of multiple options for heating and cooling homes with efficient electric appliances.

Their phone assistance is free of charge. Another great (free) service they provide is they will help you to evaluate contractor bids. They will help you to identify which contractors are properly evaluating the project and whether their pricing is fair.

State of California Incentives

On top of these (yes, these can be layered) are both state and federal incentives. State incentives, called TECH Clean California Incentives, launched about a month ago and will run out quickly. If you want to take advantage of these, you need to act fast and use a TECH-enrolled contractor. The city has a list of contractors who have done electrification work in the city, and QuitCarbon can help you identify those that would qualify for these incentives.

One notable thing with the state’s TECH Clean rebates is the incentive for air-to-water heat pumps, which are used for electrifying hydronic systems. Those of you in Eichlers with radiant floors, this is for you!

Federal Incentives

Finally, there are federal incentives in the form of tax credits. The tax credits for electric vehicles and chargers expire on September 30. These vehicles make so much sense around here. They are fun to drive; they are quiet, odor-free, and very low-maintenance; they use inexpensive electricity; and you can charge them at home. They save you money, and even more so if you can buy one in the next month.

Federal incentives for residential electrification expire at the end of the year. So you have more time there. QuitCarbon can help you to navigate these.

These incentives all stack on top of each other. My across-the-street neighbors had replaced their aging radiant system with mini splits a few years ago. A few weeks ago they installed a heat pump water heater. My neighbor rattled off to me so many incentives and discounts they received that I couldn’t keep track, and on top of that they got a $2500 bonus for disconnecting their home from gas. Pretty unbelievable.

Want to Learn More?

We are very fortunate to live in a city that is pulling out all the stops to help wean us off of gas, keep our home energy bills low, and shepherd us into the modern era of clean, efficient electric homes and vehicles. Our city is deploying not only financial incentives but also very knowledgeable concierge-level assistance.

But our city can only do so much. We residents also have to step up. Fortunately it takes just one phone call. A heat pump water heater will reduce your gas use by one-third while insulating you from gas price swings. And you don’t even need to find a contractor. Start here for that. For more general questions, or to get a holistic look at your home, start with our full-home concierge here.

I’d love to hear from those of you who have electrified some part of your home — how has it gone? — and from those of you who are thinking about it and have questions.

The state-owned company, responsible for managing production, transportation, and distribution of energy, leads this initiative that aims to strengthen renewable infrastructure and reduce costs in the expansion of the provincial electrical grid.

Mining and clean energy: a strategic alliance for development

Historically linked to gold and silver mining, San Juan now plans to move towards the extraction of strategic minerals such as copper, essential for clean technologies.

With less than a million inhabitants and 4838 registered mining jobs in 2024, the province was the second in mining exports between 2019 and 2023, according to official data.

Representatives of EPSE and the mining sector agree that renewable energy generation and solar technology manufacturing are solid complements for mining development. “We have one of the best solar radiation rates in the world. We can become a hub for the renewable industry,” says Estrada.

San Juan, leader in solar generation nationwide

Thanks to sustained political decisions, San Juan has 66.4% of installed solar power, according to Cammesa data, the administrator of the Argentine wholesale electricity market. The rest is divided among large hydroelectric plants and, to a lesser extent, thermal power plants, like a 30 MW plant that only operates during peak demand.

Since 2017, the province stopped importing electricity and became a net exporter, achieving a positive balance between generation and consumption. The current focus is on increasing available power, especially to supply the energy demand of the mining sector, as part of the San Juan Solar Project, initiated in 2007 to take advantage of the high heliophany of the region.

From solar parks to industrial production: milestones of a comprehensive energy policy

In 2011, San Juan inaugurated the first solar park in South America, San Juan 1. Currently, there are 21 operational solar parks and five under construction, most developed in partnership with private companies that lease land and manage operations.

The solar panel factory, on the other hand, is a strategic state project, designed to supply local infrastructure, reduce costs, and strengthen the electrical grid. Additionally, Estrada anticipates seeking to export components and establish links with international actors, especially from China, Europe, and the United States.

An expanding solar economy

“We are going to transform San Juan’s economy by investing mining resources in renewable energies,” says Estrada, who highlights milestones such as the completion of the first wind farm, the development of provincial solar and wind maps, and the progress of the solar panel factory.

This development model aims to integrate energy production, technological innovation, and territorial sustainability, positioning San Juan as a national benchmark in energy transition.

What's happening?

""Americans are paying more for electricity this summer"" due in part to hotter weather, and partly because data centers are siphoning more energy for AI, the paper explained.

A study backed by the Department of Energy predicted that the demand for power from these data centers will increase threefold over the next three years, requiring as much as 12% of the U.S.'s total electricity supply.

Why is this concerning?

Residents of some states have already seen an increase in their electricity costs due to increased data center activity.

According to the Washington Post, areas serviced by PJM Interconnection — including Michigan, North Carolina, Virginia, Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Indiana, Kentucky, Ohio, Illinois, Tennessee, and the District of Columbia — have seen AI-related increases in their electricity costs.

""Electricity bills for some consumers in New Jersey have increased by 20% and in Ohio, prices rose between 10% and 15%,"" USA Today noted.

In early June, some residents in the PJM Interconnection provider region saw their utility bills rise by a staggering 180%.

Voters in Taiwan are headed to the polls on Saturday to decide whether Taipei should reignite its nuclear power capabilities as the island faces immense energy vulnerabilities amid growing concern over threats posed by China.

In May, Taiwan shut the Maanshan Nuclear Power Plant — its last remaining nuclear plant — after the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) pledged in 2016 to phase out nuclear power by 2025 over concerns relating to nuclear fallout following the 2011 Fukushima accident in Japan.

Security experts have since been sounding the alarm that the move further exposes Taiwan’s vulnerabilities to China as the island is highly dependent on energy imports, relying heavily on nations like the U.S., Australia, Saudi Arabia and Qatar for both Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) and crude oil imports.

""Taiwan's energy dependence is an Achilles heel,"" Craig Singleton, China Program senior director and senior fellow with the Foundation for Defense of Democracies (FDD), said during a media call following a delegation’s visit to the island earlier this month.

""Beijing can exploit this issue without firing a single shot,"" he added, noting the ease at which China can cut off trade to the island. ""China can leverage its maritime dominance, its legal warfare and cyber tools to choke supply and test Taiwan's political resilience.""

Over the last decade, Taiwan has imported up to 97% of its energy needs, largely through fossil fuel options, which currently make up a little over 90% of its energy usage, while renewables reportedly make up another 7%, according to FDD experts.

Though prior to its decision to cut ties with the alternative energy option, nuclear power was a strong supply source and provided nearly 12% of the island’s needs in 2011.

By 2021, that supply had dropped to roughly 9.5% and by the following year it had dipped to just over 4% before completely being eliminated this year.

Nuclear power for some nations, especially in Europe, has become a solution as they look to drop dependence on carbon-emitting fuels amid escalating concern over climate change.

TRUMP'S REPORTED SNUB OF TAIWAN PRESIDENT SPURS CONCERNS OVER DEFERENCE TO CHINA

But some nations, like Germany, have taken a strong anti-nuclear approach over concerns relating to nuclear fallout — as seen following the devastating consequences of the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear power plant disaster, which not only affected those in the immediate vicinity of Ukraine, but had resounding effects across Europe.

Berlin in 2023 also phased out nuclear power entirely — but Taiwan is facing some glaring security challenges that Germany is not.

Some opponents of nuclear power have also pointed out that wartime scenarios in recent years have shown the security risks surrounding active nuclear power plants — as seen during Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and its fight over the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant.

But experts also argue that Taiwan would likely use up its stores of oil in a matter of weeks to days if China implemented a blockade, according to a report by DW.

Therefore, nuclear power would give Taipei an additional energy storage solution.

""Nuclear power does, in my view, change that calculus, providing a lot of continuity under coercion, and I think it really complicates Beijing's playbook,"" Singleton argued.

Ultimately, he said that Taiwan needs to better diversify its energy needs in order to better protect against a potential Chinese blockade.

""The U.S. needs to help Taiwan diversify fast, cut exposure to vulnerable suppliers like Qatar, and probably prepare for a contest of endurance because I think that's exactly how China is thinking about this issue,"" he added, noting Qatar’s relationship with China and its large number of LNG exports to Bejing.

This reflects a broader decoupling from subsidies, with solar photovoltaic costs falling 80% since 2010.
Looking ahead, experts predict renewables will cover nearly all global demand growth in 2024-2025, per IEA analyses shared on X.","The Resilience of Renewables Amid Subsidy Shifts

In an era of escalating energy demands, solar and wind power are demonstrating remarkable resilience, even as federal subsidies face potential rollbacks. According to a recent analysis in The Wall Street Journal, the surge in electricity needs—driven partly by data centers powering artificial intelligence—has created a fertile ground for renewables to compete on their own merits. Costs for these technologies have plummeted over the past decade, making them increasingly viable without government incentives. Industry experts note that while subsidies like those from the Inflation Reduction Act have accelerated deployment, the underlying economics now favor solar and wind in many markets.

This shift is underscored by rising wholesale electricity prices, which bolster the case for renewables. For instance, natural gas prices have spiked due to supply constraints, pushing utilities toward cheaper alternatives. Analysts project that by 2025, renewables could overtake coal as the dominant global electricity source, a milestone highlighted in reports from the International Energy Agency.

Demand Surge from Tech Innovations

The AI boom is a key catalyst. Data centers, which consume vast amounts of power, are turning to renewables for stable, low-cost energy. Hindustan Times reports that this demand, combined with the escalating costs of fossil fuels, cushions the impact of subsidy reductions. In the U.S., where policy changes under the Trump administration aim to tighten tax credits, as detailed in Reuters, renewables are still advancing. Projects are securing power purchase agreements at competitive rates, often below those of gas-fired plants.

Moreover, global trends support this trajectory. A United Nations assessment, covered in The Times of India, indicates that solar and wind have reached a tipping point, with costs dropping to levels that outpace traditional sources. This is evident in auctions where unsubsidized bids for solar projects in regions like the Middle East come in under 2 cents per kilowatt-hour.

Cost Competitiveness and Market Dynamics

Even without subsidies, levelized cost of energy (LCOE) metrics show renewables holding their own. A 2021 report from Renewable Energy World affirmed that solar and onshore wind remain competitive with gas, nuclear, and coal. Updated data from Lazard’s 2025 LCOE analysis, referenced in posts on X, pegs utility-scale solar at $26-40 per megawatt-hour, undercutting natural gas at $37-50. This cost edge is driving installations, with wind and solar projected to supply 33% of global energy by 2030, per industry roadmaps shared on social platforms.

However, challenges persist. Critics, including those in FactCheck.org, debate whether wind truly “works” without aid, pointing to variability and grid integration costs. Yet, advancements in battery storage are mitigating intermittency, enabling renewables to provide reliable power.

Policy Implications and Long-Term Strength

Recent policy moves, such as the executive order seeking to end wind and solar subsidies reported by Reuters, could initially slow growth. Business Report suggests installations might dip 23% short-term, but the sector could emerge stronger, weaned off incentives and focused on efficiency. U.S. Energy Secretary’s call to eliminate all energy subsidies, as discussed in CleanTechnica, echoes this sentiment, advocating a level playing field.

Internationally, the story is similar. In the UK, guidance for renewable auctions shows offshore wind contracts at around £117 per megawatt-hour, competitive with wholesale prices, according to posts on X from energy analysts. This reflects a broader decoupling from subsidies, with solar photovoltaic costs falling 80% since 2010.

Innovation and Future Projections

Technological innovations are accelerating this independence.

There’s no shortage of sunlight in the Lone Star State — which is leading the nation in renewable energy production.
Miggins says the state’s power grid needs all energy sources working together to keep up with demand.
“We need as much energy as we can get in Texas,” Miggins said.
“There’s a lot of manufacturing that’s comes to Texas around renewable energy,” Miggins said.","TEXAS — In Texas, we need all the power we can create to keep up with demand. But developing wind and solar projects could get more difficult for power generators across the country.

There’s no shortage of sunlight in the Lone Star State — which is leading the nation in renewable energy production.

“If you look at all the growth that is happening in Texas, our energy needs are growing faster than ever — not just with population growth, but particularly with data centers,” Big Sun Solar CEO Robert Miggins said.

Miggins says the state’s power grid needs all energy sources working together to keep up with demand.

“We need as much energy as we can get in Texas,” Miggins said. “We need oil and gas. We need coal. We need nuclear. And we definitely need wind and solar. Now I think is not a great time to for us to find ways to reduce the amount of energy we can put on the grid.”

In July, President Donald Trump signed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, ending tax incentives for power generators investing in clean renewable energy.

“We are going to see pretty significant rollbacks in new investments in wind and solar projects,” said Dr. Taylor Collins, an energy economics professor at the University of the Incarnate Word. “The good news is it really shouldn’t have too much influence on projects that are already in place. It shouldn’t roll back any currently existing infrastructure.”

Collins says that while this act could make an easier path for natural gas production, keeping up with increasing demands will become more difficult without a mix of energy sources.

“Basically, these wind and solar projects have until July 4, 2026, to start construction in order to remain eligible for the investment tax credits,” Collins said. “Which means for the next year or so, we really won’t see too much of a hit to the Texas economy.”

Even with tax breaks disappearing, CPS Energy’s CEO Rudy Garza says they will continue investing in solar and battery storage — because the community needs it, no matter the cost.

“When you decide to start taking, arbitrarily taking resources off the table, it doesn’t mean they’re going to go away,” said Garza. “It means customers are going to pay more for them.”

The electricity demand in the United States is expected to increase by 16% in the next five years. Miggins fears this legislation may push companies to build data centers outside of the U.S., which could be a security risk.

“There’s a lot of manufacturing that’s comes to Texas around renewable energy,” Miggins said. “I think a lot of these jobs are at risk.”

In the short term, Collins says the economy may see a boost as power generators push through projects before the tax credit ends, but customers won’t feel the economic effects until 2026 or 2027.

“A lot of projects that likely would have taken place might not occur anymore,” Collins said. “That’s a big loss in investment. A loss in investment comes with a loss of jobs that could potentially hit some of our GDP.”",https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/solar-3,N,,2025-08-23 10:00:06.416008

Many experts are punting this move as the primary factor in what will finally elevate electric vehicles into the position of the new mainstream option for personal mobility. Modern lithium-ion technology has taken the industry very far in recent years, having more than doubled EPA-estimated range capabilities compared to older EVs using simpler chemistries.

While the mainstream electric car industry is relatively young, the history of electrified vehicles stretches past well over 100 years. In the early 1900s, electric cars stood as serious contenders to steam and gasoline vehicles, offering quiet operation, easy starting, and zero emissions at a time when internal combustion engines were noisy and required hand cranking. These cars used lead-acid batteries and were marketed for their cleanliness and reliability, but limited range, slower speeds, and improving gasoline infrastructure eventually pushed them out of the mainstream by the 1920s, despite their technological elegance and ease of use. Veritasium tells us about some engineers who applied lithium chemistries to their battery packs and highlights why this was such a problematic route to take in the early years of energy storage solutions.

To give you the most up-to-date and accurate information possible, the data used to compile this article was sourced from various manufacturers and other authoritative sources, including Veritasium, Hyman, RM Sotheby's, and Interesting Engineering.

The Dramatic Introduction Of Lithium In Early EVs

Initial Adoption Was Way Ahead Of Its Time

The goal of Veritasium's video is to highlight how engineers struggled with applying lithium-metal battery packs

to early examples of electric vehicles, due to their high energy, resulting in extreme reactivity. Lithium reacts with standard liquid electrolytes, causing dendrite formation. These are tiny, tree-like lithium structures that develop from the source of the material as it becomes more unstable, resulting in puncture separators, spark shorts, and resultant fire risks. The video also shows us how chemistry and materials science finally got control over that behavior by modifying the electrode architecture. This introduces the nano-structured scaffold design with protective coatings, or three-dimensional frameworks, which help distribute charge evenly, thus drastically reducing stress points and thermal runaway risk.

This breakthrough centers on replacing or reformulating traditional liquid electrolytes. Researchers use advanced ceramic, polymer, and composite solid electrolytes that suppress dendrite growth while maintaining ion transport speed. Visuals depicted in the research-based video demonstrate how the battery now survives nail-puncture tests and high-temperature exposure without igniting. These tests highlight how stabilized lithium metal can finally behave safely under extreme conditions, representing a breakthrough shift in modern battery design. In today's manufacturing climate, electric vehicle battery packs have shrunk in size, while bringing longer range and faster charging, resulting in better consumer confidence.

The Genius Of Solid Electrolytes

Solid electrolytes replace flammable liquid electrolytes with ceramic, polymer, or composite materials that conduct lithium ions while physically blocking dendrite penetration. Ceramics like garnet-type oxides offer high ionic conductivity and mechanical strength, while polymers improve flexibility and make for a simpler manufacturing process. Some designs layer multiple materials to combine advantages.

Electrodes use nano-structured scaffolds, which are tiny and precisely engineered frameworks that spread lithium deposition evenly across the surface, preventing the aforementioned hotspots that trigger dendrite growth. Materials like carbon nanofibers or porous metal foams create more uniform current density during charging.

Ultra-thin films of stable compounds coat the lithium metal surface. These act as artificial solid-electrolyte interphases, reducing unwanted side reactions with the electrolyte and enhancing cycling stability. Nail penetration, crush, and thermal exposure tests measure resistance to short-circuits and fires.

The First Examples Of EVs Were Interesting

And Surprisingly Successful Considering Their Flaws

Some of the earliest examples of electric vehicles include the Columbia Runabout, produced by the Electric Vehicle Company in 1901. This was capable of reaching a 15-MPH top speed while covering 40 miles of range on a single charge. The Baker Electric Model V from Ohio’s Baker Motor Vehicle Company became a status symbol for wealthy urban drivers, including Clara Ford, the wife of Henry Ford. Detroit Electric also built some of the most successful early EVs, achieving ranges of over 80 miles per charge and catering to doctors, socialites, and city professionals.

Bear in mind that all of these models featured lead-acid batteries, which are terrible at maintaining capacity between charging cycles, ultimately causing gasoline vehicles to rapidly take over as the mainstream fueling method due to their much more practical usability, longevity, and better performance. After just 500 charge cycles, the battery pack would have lost half of its capacity, making early EV adoption a truly impossible task, as they would need full battery pack replacements at least every two years.

The GM EV1's Progressive Battery Technology

It Wasn't The Best, But It Showed A Dramatic Improvement

Early adoption of electrified vehicles in the U.S. started with the cool but rather controversial GM EV1. This compact electric coupe was intended to fill a very niche spot in the new vehicle market, but the project was ultimately scrapped due to a lack of mass market feasibility, leading to all but one test unit being scrapped and crushed. The very first iteration of the EV1 featured a 16.5-kWh lead acid battery pack, which was enough to carry the peculiar EV for a full 55 miles before running out of juice. Towards the end of its development cycle, GM finally managed to get a 26.4-kWh nickel-metal hydride battery pack into the chassis, increasing its mileage claim to a much more impressive 142 miles.

GM EV1 Performance Specifications

The GM EV1's drivetrain consisted of a single three-phase alternating current induction motor with an IGBT power inverter. This sounds like a fancy and technical configuration, but it was only enough to twist out 137 horsepower and 110 pound-feet, resulting in an eight-second 0-60 MPH time and 80 MPH top speed. GM approached Delco Electronics for the Magne Charge inductive charging paddle, which would take anywhere between six and eight hours to replenish the battery pack, depending on the output. While the GM EV1 was a considerable failure for the brand, we can't deny that it was a considerable stepping stone, the fruits of which it got to experience a couple of decades later.

The Current Progress Of Solid-State Battery Technology

Over the last year or so, a lot of manufacturers have been investing heavily in getting solid-state battery technology ready for the new electric car market. This has been an uphill battle for many brands, but most have promised that the first production-ready examples will be launched globally by the end of the decade. At the moment, the Hyundai Group appears to be the front-runner of the development program, but Mercedes-Benz isn't too far behind, as it already has a working prototype that's been tested by some reviewers. Toyota has also been very vocal about getting solid-state battery technology right before opting to make the switch to a fully electrified catalog.

On the sidelines, a lot of power source developers have been investing a great deal of time and resources into alternative energy storage chemistries. Lithium batteries are currently the leading technology for almost every electric vehicle manufacturer in the industry today, but it is an ultimately flawed model, because it requires heavy and invasive mining practices to secure the necessary amount of rare earth materials. It also aggressively fuels the ongoing humanitarian crisis of modern slavery in the Congo, where many are being forced to work in grueling conditions for little to no pay, all through the means of gathering the material at a low cost to the manufacturer. Solid state and lithium sulfur programs at Toyota, QuantumScape, and Mercedes all bank on lithium metal, yet most companies are still fighting runaway dendrites that pierce solid electrolytes and cause thermal runaway.

Viable Solutions Are Being Discovered Across The Globe

There's also a South Korean team at the Korea Research Institute of Chemical Technology that has developed a printing method that stabilizes ultrathin lithium‑metal anodes and more than doubles their lifespan compared to conventional lithium‑ion cells. The team focused on the dendrite formation by applying a protective layer via printing technology.

The dendrite formation is what impacts the chemistry's safety and cycle life over time and with use. In pouch‑cell tests, the protected lithium‑metal anodes maintained 81.5 percent of their original capacity after 100 percent charging and discharge cycles and achieved a Coulombic efficiency of 99.1 percent. The Coulombic efficiency in batteries refers to the ratio of charge extracted during discharge to the charge inserted during charging. This represents more than double the stability of unprotected lithium cells. Even under extreme conditions via charging and discharging in just nine minutes, the cells retained 74.1 percent capacity, showing exceptional resilience under rapid and high‑rate usage.",https://static1.topspeedimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/the-first-evs-were-doomed-by-batteries-that-aged-like-bananas.jpg,N,,2025-08-23 11:01:38.851537

“Power plants, any of those kinds of things, these are things that the state has some say over ….,” he said.
The industry impacted health in cities with little or no oil and gas activity, including Washington, DC, New York City and Chicago, according to the study.","Listen to the audio version of this article (generated by AI).

Air pollution from oil and gas activities is responsible for an estimated 91,000 deaths and over 10,000 preterm births in the US each year, according to a new study that examined the impacts of the industry through its lifecycle from extraction to refining to burning fuel in power plants.

The study, published August 22 in the journal Science Advances, also attributes an estimated 216,000 annual incidences of US childhood asthma to air pollutants from fossil fuels, as well as over 1,600 lifetime cancers.

California, Texas, New York, Pennsylvania and New Jersey have the highest total health burden from all stages of oil and gas production and use, according to the study, with racial minorities facing disproportionate exposure to harmful air pollutants that include fine particulate matter, ozone and nitrogen dioxide.

The findings, based on data from 2017, likely underestimate the health toll of the US oil and gas lifecycle, the authors said, given annual production increased by 40% from 2017 to 2023 and consumption increased by about 8%.

“Every day, new peer-reviewed evidence emerges demonstrating the level of harm the petrochemical industry causes,” Heather McTeer Toney, executive director of the nonprofit Beyond Petrochemicals, said in a statement. “Faced with this data, I can’t imagine how a government official at any level could support building more petrochemical plants.”

Previous studies have focused on air pollution from a single stage of the oil and gas lifecycle, a single air pollutant, or a specific region, according to the study authors.

To measure the industry’s national health impact, the researchers combined data from several sources, from US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)’s National Emission Inventory. The new study is “a solid leap forward” in its effort to determine the industry’s broader health impacts, said Johnathan Buonocore, an air pollution researcher at Boston University. “This paper shows there’s impacts across that whole supply chain that we all should be paying attention to,” he said.

The findings come after the Trump administration launched what the US EPA in March called the “biggest deregulatory action in US history,” with a particular focus on easing regulations “throttling the oil and gas industry.”

Last month, the administration announced plans to rescind the government’s “endangerment finding,” which forms the basis for enforcing limits on greenhouse gas emissions. The administration issued a rule that extends by 18 months deadlines for fossil fuel operations to reduce their emissions of methane and volatile organic compounds.

The Environmental Defense Fund, the Center for Biological Diversity and other nonprofits this week filed a motion asking a federal court to stop the move to delay these limits on pollution from oil and gas operations.

“Rather than hold Big Oil accountable for its pollution, the Trump administration is forcing people to breathe dangerous chemicals and suffer the harms of an overheating climate,” Maggie Coulter, an attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity’s Climate Law Institute, said in a statement.

Even as the federal government moves to roll back and delay air pollution protections, states still have the option to implement their own stricter regulations, including more stringent permitting requirements and pollution control rules, said Buonocore.

“Power plants, any of those kinds of things, these are things that the state has some say over ….,” he said. “States have the ability to set their own regulations that go above and beyond the federal floor.”

Buonocore and colleagues concluded in a 2023 study that oil and gas production is responsible for $77 billion in annual health costs – about three times the cost of climate impacts from the industry’s methane emissions. The industry impacted health in cities with little or no oil and gas activity, including Washington, DC, New York City and Chicago, according to the study.

Battery energy storage systems are becoming a vital part of our nation’s energy infrastructure.
Even in the rare event of a fire, battery energy storage systems are designed with layers of safeguards to keep it contained.
Those same lessons about readiness, accountability, and public trust, all apply today as battery energy storage expands across New York.
Our message is simple: under New York’s standards and fire code, battery energy storage systems are safe.","During my time as head of hazmat operations for the New York City Fire Department, I learned that New Yorkers expect one thing above all else: to know their safety is never compromised. That principle guided every decision I made at the FDNY, and it should continue to guide how we evaluate new technologies today.

New York’s recently adopted fire code updates for battery energy storage systems (BESS) do exactly that. These standards are among the strongest in the country, built on years of safety testing, collaboration, and the expertise of experienced fire professionals. They prove that when it comes to public safety, New York doesn’t cut corners.

Battery energy storage systems are becoming a vital part of our nation’s energy infrastructure. They help stabilize the grid, reduce costs, and keep the lights on during periods of high demand. Like any technology, they must be held to the highest safety standards — and in New York, they are.

Even in the rare event of a fire, battery energy storage systems are designed with layers of safeguards to keep it contained. New York’s fire code requires each battery unit to be housed in its own compartment, preventing flames from spreading. Before these systems are ever installed, the code requires manufacturers to subject them to extensive fire testing.

If an incident occurs, the system is automatically taken offline, trained firefighters respond, and independent experts are brought in to investigate the cause and assess impacts.

To date, no battery energy storage fire in New York has ever spread beyond a facility’s perimeter, nor has one caused injury or environmental harm to the surrounding air, soil, or water. That record is not chance — it reflects rigorous codes, continuous monitoring, and proactive training.

Modern systems go even further. Today’s projects in New York are purpose-built with safety designed into every corner of the system. These projects are monitored 24/7/365 with sophisticated detection systems that atomically turn components off if they are malfunctioning. This also allows operators to turn portions of the system or the entire system off if something isn’t operating correctly.

Fires at these facilities are extremely rare. According to the Electric Power Research Institute, BESS fire cases have dropped by 98% from 2018 to 2024, despite a 25,000% increase in battery energy storage systems during that time. By comparison, electrical failure or equipment malfunctions in commercial buildings were attributed to 12,600 fires in 2022 alone. In that same year, there were six reported BESS events.

In any response, firefighters rely on training, planning, and coordination in the face of potential unimaginable circumstances. Those same lessons about readiness, accountability, and public trust, all apply today as battery energy storage expands across New York. The priority must always be to anticipate risks and put protections in place well in advance.

That is exactly what New York is doing. The state’s code builds on and strengthens one of the nation’s most comprehensive fire codes for energy storage, establishing some of the most robust requirements anywhere in the country.

The latest updates go further by requiring Emergency Response Plans to be developed with local fire departments, mandating firefighter training, and ensuring independent third-party technical reviews. These safeguards guarantee that firefighters have the tools and information they need before a system is built, and that every project undergoes a thorough, impartial review.

New York’s fire code now exceeds even recent EPA recommendations. In addition, every BESS site in New York is required to provide fire departments with a direct phone line to trained experts for immediate support, even though EPA boss Lee Zeldin is raising doubts.

That is why fire safety experts and former fire officials, including myself, issued a Fire Safety Declaration last month. Our message is simple: under New York’s standards and fire code, battery energy storage systems are safe.

Trust grows from transparency, honest engagement with the public, and ongoing training for fire departments as these systems expand. Safety is never a finished job; it is a continuing responsibility. For New Yorkers, the takeaway should be clear: these systems are being carefully reviewed before being installed, the codes are rigorous, and safeguards are firmly in place.

I can say after more than three decades as a firefighter: I stand by these updated codes and the process that produced them. New York has once again set the standard for putting public safety first, and communities across the state will be safer because of it.

Overview of Tax Credits for Cars in 2025

Tax credits for vehicles in 2025 come in several forms designed to promote cleaner transportation and support American manufacturing. The two most notable are the federal electric vehicle (EV) tax credit and the newly reinstated auto loan interest deduction under the Big Beautiful Bill. Both aim to make owning a new vehicle more affordable, particularly for Chicago-area families balancing urban commutes and weekend getaways.

The EV tax credit provides up to $7,500 for qualifying new electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles. Vehicles must meet specific assembly and battery sourcing criteria, with price caps generally set at $80,000 for SUVs and trucks, and $55,000 for sedans. This incentive is particularly relevant for buyers in neighborhoods like University Village and Mid-North District who prioritize sustainability and cost savings.

Complementing this is the auto loan interest deduction introduced by the Big Beautiful Bill, effective for new vehicle loans starting in 2025. It allows taxpayers to deduct up to $10,000 annually in auto loan interest paid, benefiting those financing their purchase. Importantly, this deduction applies only to vehicles assembled in the United States, aligning with Chevrolet’s commitment to American manufacturing.

Specific income limitations also apply: single filers with a modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) up to $100,000 and joint filers up to $200,000 qualify for the deduction, with gradual phase-outs above these thresholds.

For Chicago families in areas like Maplewood or Wrightwood Neighbors, understanding these credits can translate into real savings on reliable Chevrolet SUVs and trucks built for both city streets and suburban roads.

What Cars Qualify Under the Big Beautiful Bill?

The Big Beautiful Bill reintroduces a valuable tax deduction for auto loan interest, targeting new vehicle purchasers who finance their cars. This provision specifically excludes leased vehicles and used cars, focusing exclusively on new vehicles with final assembly in the United States.

Eligible vehicles include:

Cars, minivans, SUVs, pickup trucks, and motorcycles with a gross vehicle weight rating under 14,000 pounds.

Vehicles intended strictly for personal use, excluding commercial or business applications.

This means Chevrolet’s latest models, including the Equinox and Silverado EVs assembled domestically, are prime candidates for the deduction, offering Chicago-area customers an added financial benefit beyond the vehicle’s performance and features.

Financing must commence after December 31, 2024, ensuring that loan interest paid during 2025 to 2028 qualifies for the deduction. Importantly, if you refinance a qualifying vehicle, the interest on the refinanced loan may also be deductible, provided the vehicle was originally new and personally owned.

While the maximum deduction is $10,000 annually, experts note that average buyers may see smaller savings due to typical loan sizes and interest accrual. For example, a typical new Chevrolet financed at local Chicago dealerships might realize a deduction translating to several hundred dollars in tax savings, which still contributes meaningful relief given current vehicle prices.

Residents of Chicago’s South Loop and East Village can take advantage of this deduction when choosing Chevrolet models known for their American craftsmanship, blending performance with tax-smart purchasing.

Which Vehicles Qualify for the Auto Loan Interest Tax Credit?

To benefit from the auto loan interest deduction, both the vehicle and financing must meet precise conditions:

The vehicle must be new, purchased with a loan starting on or after January 1, 2025.

Final assembly must occur within the United States; buyers can verify this via the vehicle’s window sticker or VIN.

The vehicle type must be a car, SUV, minivan, pickup truck, or motorcycle weighing less than 14,000 pounds.

It must be used for personal purposes only; commercial or business vehicles are excluded.

Leases are not eligible for this deduction.

Refinancing is allowed but only if the vehicle was originally purchased new and owned personally.

These criteria underscore the benefits of choosing Chevrolet vehicles, many of which are assembled domestically and designed with Chicago’s urban and suburban driving in mind. For instance, the Chevrolet Blazer EV and Equinox EV models meet these assembly and weight requirements, making them ideal candidates for buyers in neighborhoods such as Ducktown.

The deduction phases out for taxpayers exceeding income limits, so prospective buyers should consult with a tax professional to assess their eligibility based on household income and loan details.

IRS Car Allowance and Mileage Rates for 2025

For individuals using their vehicles for business, charitable, medical, or moving purposes, the IRS standard mileage rates provide a method to calculate deductible expenses related to car use.

The 2025 mileage rates are:

Business use (including self-employed): 70 cents per mile

Charitable activities: 14 cents per mile

Medical or moving purposes (military only): 21 cents per mile

These rates have increased slightly from previous years, reflecting rising fuel and maintenance costs. Commuters and business owners in Chicago’s Forestville and Mid-North District can use these rates to maximize deductions related to vehicle use on tax filings.

Understanding these rates is essential for those who might not qualify for direct tax credits but still want to reduce taxable income through mileage deductions, especially when operating Chevrolet trucks or SUVs that are well-suited for heavier-duty or versatile driving needs.

Vehicles Eligible for the $7,500 Federal Tax Credit

The $7,500 federal tax credit remains a significant incentive for buyers of qualifying electric vehicles (EVs) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs). Chevrolet leads with several models that qualify for this credit in 2025, benefiting Chicago drivers seeking a dependable, American-made EV or PHEV.

Some Chevrolet models eligible for the full $7,500 credit include:

Chevrolet Equinox EV (2024-2026, LT and RS models) with an MSRP cap of $80,000

Chevrolet Silverado EV (2025-2026, LT model), also capped at $80,000

Chevrolet Blazer EV (2024-2026 models) fitting within the same price limit

Other notable vehicles qualifying for the credit include the Ford F-150 Lightning EV and Chrysler Pacifica PHEV, but Chevrolet’s offerings stand out for their combination of American assembly, advanced connectivity, and family-friendly features.

Buyers in Chicago’s University Village and Wrightwood Neighbors will find these vehicles well-suited for both city driving and weekend excursions.

It’s important to check the specific VIN of the vehicle to confirm eligibility, as assembly location and battery sourcing affect qualification. The Department of Energy’s VIN check tool is a valuable resource for this verification.

Does a Toyota Plug-in Hybrid Qualify for Federal Tax Credits?

Toyota’s plug-in hybrid models have historically qualified for federal tax credits; however, recent changes to EV tax credit legislation have introduced stricter battery sourcing and assembly requirements.

While many Toyota plug-in hybrids meet the criteria for federal tax incentives, buyers should verify:

Whether the vehicle was assembled in North America

Compliance with specific battery component and critical mineral sourcing rules

MSRP limits (typically capped at $80,000 for SUVs and trucks)

Compared to Chevrolet’s plug-in hybrids and EVs, Toyota models may have different eligibility statuses depending on assembly location and battery composition.

“The tempo of activity on the production floor was positive with large materials handling orders in fulfillment, plus substantial electrolyzer activity and a GenSure project for a rail customer,” Irwin said. “We think investors under-appreciate the importance of the three elephant-sized electrolyzer projects Plug is pursuing, as just one would load production for a few years and support +EBITDA. Gross margins and cash flow are probably tracking well towards recent targets.”

Roth hosted the tour and met with chief executive officer Andy Marsh and chief financial officer Paul Middleton. Irwin said Plug’s materials handling business appears to be rebounding on improved funding visibility from the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act’s 48E clean energy credit. Updated 48E terms allow the full 30% investment tax credit for qualified fuel-cell property that begins construction between 2026 and 2032. “We saw a couple of large materials handling orders in process of fulfillment on the production floor, giving confidence to our thesis. Electrolyzer and GenSure activity also seems to be benefiting,” he said.

Plug Power, headquartered in Latham, N.Y., designs and manufactures hydrogen fuel-cell systems used in forklifts and other equipment across large manufacturing and distribution facilities in North America.

Irwin pointed to the scale of three major electrolyzer projects, in Spain, Finland, and Australia, as potentially transformative.

“The 3GW Allied Green Ammonia project in Australia aims for committed financing later this year, which would present a major catalyst,” he said. “On the 2Q25 call, management confirmed the electrolyzer pipeline is strong, and we are optimistic the company could announce Cape Buffalo-sized agreements in 2H25.”

He also noted engagement from the U.S. Department of Energy’s Loan Programs Office, which continues to work with Plug despite cancelling many other facilities.

“Greg Beard, who assumed the leadership role at LPO in May, spent a decade at Apollo and has about 30 years’ experience in energy investment,” Irwin said. “We believe management is intently focused on cementing an external equity partnership for the Texas electrolyzer and satisfying updated disbursement conditions/terms with DOE.”

Cash flow could also improve in the second half of 2025, he said, with benefits from power purchase agreement recovery, inventory liquidation, credit sales, and positive margins on multiple projects. Plug ended the second quarter with US$140-million in unrestricted cash and US$876-million in total cash. Cash burn of US$230-million compared with US$146-million in Q4 2024 and US$356-million in Q2 2024. The company expects restructuring efforts to yield substantial progress by year-end 2025.

Irwin expects Plug Power to post 2025 Adjusted EBITDA of negative US$400.0-million on revenue of US$733.9-million, versus his prior forecast of negative US$350.0-million and US$700.0-million, respectively. For 2026, he sees improvement to negative US$215.0-million on revenue of US$850.0-million

At Wild Hope Farm they grow in succession, so the next round of crops will hopefully be healthier, but handling the impacts of weather can be difficult.
Last year with Helene, Wild Hope Farm lost about 80% of its fall crops.","CHESTER, S.C. — Katherine Belk started farming in 2017. The owner of Wild Hope Farm said she thinks about the weather all the time.

“I like working, and I love tough problems, and I've never met a harder problem than farming,” Belk said.

This year those problems include the high temperatures in July and heavy rain in August.

For many farmers in the Carolinas, like Belk, it's all in a day's work.

“Because of the kind of variability in weather these days, we’ve invested heavily in the high tunnels. These allow us to grow year-round,” Belk said.

Growing inside high tunnels usually protects plants but can cause issues with runoff when it consistently rains.

“We’re trying to prevent erosion, so right now what we’re trying to do is laying some drainage pipes on either end of the high tunnel,” Belk said.

The last several weeks produced several inches of rain, which damages uncovered crops.

“You can see clearly that this bed is eroding. You can see where the water, the heavy rains, where the soil was moved from the bed,” Belk said.

At Wild Hope Farm they grow in succession, so the next round of crops will hopefully be healthier, but handling the impacts of weather can be difficult.

“Incredibly frustrating,” Belk said. “I woke up at 4, just stressed about the weather. The fact that we’re going to be like two weeks behind on our fall plantings.”

Tough weather conditions even impact the distribution side of farming. Belk sells at farmers markets, community-supported agriculture and wholesale.

“When our crops are suffering, we have fewer yields, lower yields, and it means that we make less money from whole-selling,” Belk said.

That’s why she says it’s crucial to support local farmers and even restaurants that sell locally grown food.

“It is just really, really challenging to grow, to farm in today’s weather climate and so we need all of the support we can get, and it really does make all the difference to have the community at your back,” Belk said.

She said to support farmers, go to farmer's markets. Buy local produce, eggs and meat.

This time of year, with hurricane season, conditions for farmers can be unpredictable. Last year with Helene, Wild Hope Farm lost about 80% of its fall crops.

Belk said there’s not much you can do to prepare for weather like a hurricane, so the farm is hoping for the best this hurricane season.",https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/View_recent_photos-35,N,,2025-08-23 15:02:30.439523

Range anxiety is one of the biggest ‘pitfalls’ of EVs, with many customers holding back on buying an electric car due to fears of running out of battery.

Companies around the world are looking for a solution, and a Chinese team might have come up with the answer.

Its new battery has twice the range of the Tesla advanced 4860 cell, and could eliminate range fears once and for all.

DISCOVER OUR SUPERCAR AUCTION SITE – View live auctions on SBX Cars

How much range does the battery have?

Currently, a pilot production line has been set up for the new EV battery.

The team behind it is from Tianjin University, and they say it has 660 watt-hours per kilogram of energy density.

For context, the Tesla 4680 battery has 300 watt-hours per kilogram of density.

Even more interesting is that BYD’s Blade Battery has an energy density of just 150 watt-hours per kilogram.

In terms of mileage, the team behind it has not yet released any figures.

For context, in the base Model Y standard range, the 4680 battery packs have 311 miles of range.

But in longer-range models, it approaches the 400-mile mark.

If we crudely say double the density is double the range, the Chinese battery could last for up to 800 miles in some cases.

How bad is range anxiety?

Range anxiety has been a problem with electric cars for some time.

It stems from a fear of running out of battery on the road, without an EV charger being nearby.

As electric vehicle charging points become more common, though, that will become a thing of the past.

In fact, it then becomes no different from wanting to find a gas station for an ICE car.

But it is still something that holds many people back from buying an electric car.

Should this battery be put into production, it could double or quadruple the range of many EVs.

An electric car of 600 miles or more would shatter any fears of range anxiety and eliminate it altogether.

We knew that the Chinese would be the major player [in global EV competition.]
And the biggest drop in sales came from Tesla, which alone accounts for 46% of the U.S. EV market.
“The global EV environment is facing increasing domination from Chinese automakers,” says Mr. Brauer of iSeeCars.com.
Now, U.S. automakers “are adapting, shifting products around,” says Mr. Abuelsamid.","President Donald Trump has positioned himself as a defender of gas cars, and a foe of any mandate to phase them out. But his U-turn on federal policy doesn’t spell the end of an electric revolution in Detroit, which has invested decades and hundreds of billions of dollars in developing electric vehicles, batteries, and their supply chains.

An announcement last week by Ford marks the most definitive statement yet by an American automaker that it is committed to the future of electric cars, no matter what happens in Washington.

CEO Jim Farley said the company will invest $5 billion in an all-new modular EV platform and assembly process that will make it easier and cheaper to produce electric models in the United States. The company also announced the first product to be built with this system: a small electric pickup set to debut in 2027 for under $30,000.

The announcement, at a union factory in Louisville, Kentucky, reflected what many in the auto industry say is an increasingly clear reality: Electric transportation – and the technology to produce it more affordably – is barreling ahead, regardless of American politics or culture. And if U.S. automakers don’t want to fall behind, they need to figure out how to strike a delicate balance among shifting political demands in Washington, the evolving tastes of American car buyers, and global competition, especially from China.

“It’s so difficult to impress on people who are not watching the industry that the next step in the automobile will be electric,” says Sam Fiorani, vice president of global vehicle forecasting at AutoForecast Solutions in Chester Springs, Pennsylvania. “If you take your foot off the accelerator of EV development, China is not going to slow down. And once you lose the lead, you become an also-ran very quickly.”

Ford’s announcement demonstrates its dedication to not becoming one of those also-rans by staying in the global competition.

Soon after he took office, Mr. Trump instructed Congress to eliminate the $7,500 purchase rebates for American-made EVs, as well as fuel economy standards for car manufacturers that effectively required EV production in order to comply. The administration has also done away with the Environmental Protection Agency’s mandate to regulate carbon emissions and California’s waiver to set its own air quality standards that are stricter than the rest of the nation. It recently implemented a federal road tax just for EVs that is about twice what an average driver pays in federal gas taxes.

All of this has made the environment for EVs “far more challenging in the U.S. market this year,” says Karl Brauer, executive analyst at iSeeCars.com.

Pioneer of assembly lines, Ford aims to innovate again

To make EVs affordable, Ford envisions a massive overhaul of the production process. Its plans, years in the making, developed out of view. A small, dedicated skunkworks of management engineers, poached from EV and tech firms such as Apple, Tesla, Rivian, Lucid, and Amazon, has been working in Long Beach, California, far from Ford’s Detroit-area headquarters.

“The automotive industry in America is at a crossroads about new technology and about new competition from everywhere,” Mr. Farley told the assembled autoworkers. “We saw this coming for years. We knew that the Chinese would be the major player [in global EV competition.] For too long, legacy automakers played it safe. We needed a radical approach. We need to do it and be sustainable and make money, and we need to do it with American workers.”

Ford called its plan a “Model T moment,” because it aims to bring back a kind of modular production system that will allow it to easily build a variety of body styles on a single production line. Instead of a single car moving down an assembly line with workers adding parts along the way, the line will have three branches, like rivers coming together at the end, with front, middle, and rear sections that can be mixed and matched to meet demand. So a single center cabin could get a sedan, hatchback, SUV, or pickup back end. With each portion built separately, workers will no longer have to reach through doors to install large parts like dashboards, making production much more efficient – and safer.

Despite the anti-EV rhetoric coming out of Washington, 10% more EVs were sold during the first quarter of 2025 – nearly 300,000 vehicles – than during the same time frame in 2024, according to Cox Automotive data. Sales dropped in the second quarter, to 6% below last year, but they were still higher in the first six months of 2025 than they were in 2024. And the biggest drop in sales came from Tesla, which alone accounts for 46% of the U.S. EV market.

At the time, Tesla had shut down its Model Y factory in Texas in preparation to build an updated model with a new assembly process similar to the one Ford announced last week. Many potential Tesla buyers and existing owners also balked at CEO Elon Musk’s actions at the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), giving rise to bumper stickers proclaiming, “Bought before I knew Elon was crazy,” or “This is my last Tesla.”

Excluding Tesla, EV sales actually rose 4% in the first half of 2025 compared with last year.

“If this administration had its way, [American automakers] would stop production of anything electrified; they would only build big trucks and SUVs,” says Samuel Abuelsamid, vice president of market research at the Detroit-based consultancy Telemetry. But “People in Japan are never going to buy [Ford] F-150s, because they won’t fit on their tiny roads. Markets like Japan and Korea don’t buy U.S. products because we don’t build anything they can use.”

China drives a changing global marketplace

Ford’s investment shows that Detroit is motivated more by Chinese competition than by Washington politics, analysts say.

“The global EV environment is facing increasing domination from Chinese automakers,” says Mr. Brauer of iSeeCars.com. Chinese automakers have been gobbling up market share with EVs in Europe, where Ford and Stellantis have business worth tens of billions of dollars. EVs account for 49% of car sales in China, where Ford made $660 million last year, while business for both General Motors and Stellantis there has been faltering.

Now, U.S. automakers “are adapting, shifting products around,” says Mr. Abuelsamid. Going forward, legacy automakers will focus more on smaller, more affordable electric cars, such as the new small electric pickup that Ford announced, he says. GM is bringing back the affordable Chevrolet Bolt EV. And Hyundai and Kia have a raft of new smaller models in the wings. Legacy automakers have “realized they put too much emphasis on the high end of the market,” he says, in part trying to emulate Tesla’s success in selling $70,000 to $130,000 EVs.

“We’re committed to electrification,” says Marty Gunsberg, spokesperson for Ford Model e, in a statement to the Monitor. “We appreciate the administration’s work to align regulations with market realities, and we believe electric vehicles are a great customer solution. These are the vehicles that will go toe-to-toe with China. We ... think our investments speak for themselves.”

Cheaper batteries are also part of the effort to bring prices down. GM, Ford, and Tesla are transitioning to batteries using the lithium iron phosphate technology from power tools, which costs half as much as earlier EV technology that was akin to what’s used in laptop computers and cellphones.

If there is a change in the EV market at the moment, then, it’s less a pullback from electric cars than a reflection that previous forecasts were too optimistic, says Mr. Fiorani, the analyst in Pennsylvania.

“The problem in both the U.S. and Europe is that regulators pushed [automakers] to produce more [EVs] than the markets could bear,” he says. “The whole industry was under the misperception that this was going to be a relatively quick transition to EVs, and that just wasn’t going to be the case.”",https://images.csmonitor.com/csm/2025/08/0822%20NEVFUTURE%20lede.jpg?alias=standard_900x600,N,,2025-08-23 08:03:02.490829

According to the financial services major, lowering GST rates for conventional vehicles may make them more attractive in terms of upfront cost, which could slow the adoption of EVs that are still relatively expensive despite government incentives.

Currently, EVs attract a 5% GST rate, compared to 28% for ICE vehicles. Any reduction in the latter category could narrow the price gap, discouraging customers from transitioning to electric mobility.

The total cost of the project was $4 billion.

Ørsted announced in a press release:

Revolution Wind is complying with the order and is taking appropriate steps to stop offshore activities, ensuring the safety of workers and the environment.

The project commenced offshore construction following the final federal approval from BOEM last year. The project is 80% complete with all offshore foundations installed and 45 out of 65 wind turbines installed.

Ørsted is evaluating all options to resolve the matter expeditiously. This includes engagement with relevant permitting agencies for any necessary clarification or resolution as well as through potential legal proceedings, with the aim being to proceed with continued project construction towards COD in the second half of 2026.

Revolution Wind is fully permitted, having secured all required federal and state permits including its Construction and Operations Plan approval letter on 17 November 2023 following reviews that began more than nine years ago. Revolution Wind has 20-year power purchase agreements to deliver 400 MW of electricity to Rhode Island and 304 MW to Connecticut, enough to power over 350,000 homes across both states to meet their growing energy demand. As a reference, South Fork Wind, which is adjacent to Revolution Wind and uses the same turbine technology, delivered reliable energy to New York at a capacity factor of 53% for the first half of 2025, on par with the state’s baseload power sources.

Ørsted is investing into American energy generation, grid upgrades, port infrastructure, and a supply chain, including US shipbuilding and manufacturing extending to more than 40 states. Revolution Wind is already employing hundreds of local union workers supporting both on and offshore construction activities. Ørsted’s US offshore wind projects have totalled approximately 4 million labour union hours to date, 2 million of which are with Revolution Wind.

Ørsted is evaluating the potential financial implications of this development, considering a range of scenarios, including legal proceedings. Ørsted will, in due course, advise the market on the potential impact of the order on the plan announced on 11 August 2025 (company announcement 12/2025) to conduct a rights issue. Existing shareholders and prospective investors are advised to await further announcements by the company.

But the Trump administration has enacted policies to curtail new clean energy projects and instead foster greater reliance on fossil fuels.
Approving and permitting new clean energy projects has become increasingly difficult, taking away a valuable asset from energy providers at a critical time.
Ending Biden-era clean energy policies Since he returned to office, Mr. Trump has been dismantling Biden-era clean energy policies, resulting in the termination of more than $22 billion in renewable energy projects, according to an analysis by the environmental policy firm E2.
“By slowing clean energy deployment, the Administration is directly fueling cost increases,” Jason Grumet, CEO of the American Clean Power Association, said in a statement.","If you noticed your utility bill has gone up this summer, you’re not alone. On average, electricity costs are 5.5% higher today than they were a year ago, according to the latest federal data, and natural gas is up 13.8%.

Nearly 60 utility companies are set to increase electricity rates this year by more than $38 billion, affecting more than 57 million Americans, according to analysis from the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank.

President Trump recently commented on the rising prices, blaming them on renewable power. He wrote on Truth Social that renewables were “THE SCAM OF THE CENTURY!” And he vowed he would not approve wind and solar projects.

But higher rates are largely a result of higher demand, and that’s being driven by the rapid expansion of artificial intelligence, oil and gas drilling, space heating and electrified forms of transportation — all technologies that require immense amounts of power, according to Rob Gramlich, president of Grid Strategies, a D.C. based energy consultancy firm, “When supply is scarce, then prices go up,” he said.

Gramlich says that after 25 years of a flat demand for energy and a dip during the pandemic, demand rose once economic activity picked up after the pandemic was over.

Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has also played a role in higher costs, disrupting international energy supply chains and causing rates to go up in the U.S. Rapid growth in data centers and newer electrified forms of technology mean the nation will need 15% more capacity — or 120 gigawatts — by the end of the decade to keep pace, Gramlich estimated.

The increasing demand is a big reason why the U.S. Energy Information Administration expects residential electricity rates to increase steadily by as much as 18% in the next few years, far outstripping the annual inflation rate of about 2.7%.

The fastest way to bring rates down would be to increase supply, but there are challenges.

U.S. falling behind on transmission

Gramlich, in recent testimony before Congress, said there’s no shortage of fuel to add to the grid — it’s a shortage of transmission that’s the major problem.

At the end of 2023, there were more than 2,600 gigawatts of energy waiting to get connected, representing over twice the current installed capacity of the U.S. power grid, according to the Lawrence Berkeley National Lab. And 95% of it was generated by solar, wind, and battery storage.

To meet growing electricity needs, the U.S. needs to expand transmission systems by 60% by 2030, and even that may need to triple by 2050, according to a 2022 report by the Department of Energy.

“If we can get a lot of transmission built, then I think we can meet the AI-driven data center demands,” Gramlich said.

AI data centers consume far more power from the grid than regular data centers, says Norman Bashir, a fellow at MIT’s Climate and Sustainability Consortium, where researchers are studying the impact of generative AI on the grid.

“AI data centers are much more power intensive,” Bashir told CBS News Boston last month. “So, if you have a normal data center, an AI data center would be up to 10 times more power intensive.”

Role of tariffs and equipment shortages

Beyond the transmission backlog, Gramlich says tariffs and equipment shortages are making energy projects more expensive. One example — gas turbines are extremely scarce right now, and that’s holding up the expansion of natural gas power plants.

“The price of an actual turbine has almost tripled,” Gramlich said. And the wait time for a gas turbine is around three or four years — even as long as seven, according to a May analysis by S&P Global.

Energy sources

Over the past decade, the nation’s energy mix has increasingly grown to favor natural gas and renewables, like wind, solar and hydropower, that have become much cheaper to produce. New nuclear plants won’t be on line before 2030, Gramlich said, and coal is becoming less economically viable because of maintenance and update costs required to address pollution concerns.

“That leaves wind and solar and battery storage that can help in this decade,” Gramlich told CBS News.

But the Trump administration has enacted policies to curtail new clean energy projects and instead foster greater reliance on fossil fuels. Approving and permitting new clean energy projects has become increasingly difficult, taking away a valuable asset from energy providers at a critical time.

“If things keep going like this, [utility bills] are gonna be higher next year,” Gramlich said.

Trump energy policies projected to raise prices

Upon returning to office, Mr. Trump issued a “National Energy Emergency” executive order, arguing the country needs “reliable, diversified, and affordable supply of energy to drive our Nation’s manufacturing, transportation, agriculture, and defense industries, and to sustain the basics of modern life and military preparedness.”

Most of the actions tied to that order have gutted renewable energy generation and are bolstering fossil fuel development.

The passage of Trump’s signature legislation, One Big Beautiful Bill Act, is expected to make energy more expensive, impact jobs, and make it more difficult to meet rising energy demand, according to analysis by Energy Innovation, a nonpartisan energy and climate policy think tank.

OBBBA will change the tax code, increasing generation costs, resulting in a drop in power generation capacity of 340 gigawatts by 2035, says Michael O’Boyle, acting policy team director of Energy Innovation in an email to CBS News. To put that in perspective, 1 gigawatt typically powers 750,000 homes, so 340 gigawatts could power about 255 million homes.

O’Boyle estimates wholesale energy prices will increase by 74% by 2035, resulting in a $170 annual increase in the average household energy bill. Some 760,000 jobs could be lost by 2030, and the states that are expected to see the biggest impacts on energy cost increases and job losses from the OBBBA are South Carolina, Florida, Texas, Kentucky and North Carolina.

The Energy Department criticized the analysis and its support of renewables arguing, “The OBBBA ensures taxpayers will no longer be forced to subsidize intermittent energy sources like wind and solar – subsidies that have only resulted in more expensive, less reliable energy,” said Ben Dietderich, the department’s press secretary and chief spokesman, in an email to CBS News.

Ending Biden-era clean energy policies

Since he returned to office, Mr. Trump has been dismantling Biden-era clean energy policies, resulting in the termination of more than $22 billion in renewable energy projects, according to an analysis by the environmental policy firm E2.

“Unfortunately, the president and Congress is making it harder for Americans to have access to the cheapest, cleanest, quickest to deploy power there is,” said Bob Keefe, E2’s executive director.

“By slowing clean energy deployment, the Administration is directly fueling cost increases,” Jason Grumet, CEO of the American Clean Power Association, said in a statement. Grumet cited EIA data and noted, “The top four clean energy states are seeing prices decline this year, while the 10 states with the least renewable power all face rising costs.”

Trump admin. keeping fossil fuel generation alive

To address rising energy demand, the Energy Department has ordered some utility companies to keep coal power plants open beyond their retirement dates, an action that could cost more than $3.1 billion a year by 2028, according to analysis by Gramlich’s firm, Grid Strategies.

“These coal plants are basically uneconomic in the market. Each year, they incur tens of millions of dollars of maintenance just to stay operating,” said Gramlich.

Those costs to extend the life of coal plants will be borne by ratepayers, according to a ruling by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.

Coal plants are generally planned for retirement when their operating cost exceeds their expected revenue or their value to the electric grid, the EIA has pointed out. Coal-fired plants, which produce high levels of CO2 emissions, have been under pressure to be phased out in many states, in particular, those with clean energy goals. According to the EIA, natural gas and clean energy sources are providing a growing share of the nation’s electricity, while coal has been waning. By the end of 2023, the maximum potential power plant output for coal was 15.2%, down from 45% in 1990.

If additional fossil fuel-based plants delay retirement dates — 28% were expected to be retired by 2035 — the bill to ratepayers could grow to more than $6 billion.

According to the source, who requested anonymity because the plan has not been finalized, the Department of Energy (DOE) is expected to solicit proposals from industry within days.
The plan envisions offering the plutonium to companies at little or no cost.
A similar program to convert the material into mixed-oxide (MOX) reactor fuel collapsed in 2018 when the Trump administration terminated a costly project that was expected to exceed $50 billion.
“Trying to convert this material into reactor fuel is insanity,” said Edwin Lyman, a nuclear physicist at the Union of Concerned Scientists.","The Trump administration is preparing a plan to release roughly 20 metric tons of Cold War-era plutonium from dismantled nuclear warheads for potential use as reactor fuel by U.S. power companies, according to a source familiar with the discussions and a draft policy memo obtained by Reuters.

While plutonium has previously been tested in commercial reactors only on a limited basis, the proposal would mark the first significant effort to integrate the material into the U.S. energy market.

The move stems from a directive signed by President Donald Trump in May, which instructed federal agencies to scale back a long-running program aimed at diluting and disposing of surplus plutonium, instead prioritising its use in advanced nuclear technologies.

According to the source, who requested anonymity because the plan has not been finalized, the Department of Energy (DOE) is expected to solicit proposals from industry within days. The source cautioned that key provisions could still change before a formal announcement.

The plan envisions offering the plutonium to companies at little or no cost. In return, utilities would assume full financial responsibility for transporting the material and building, operating, and eventually decommissioning government-approved facilities to process it into reactor-ready fuel.

The 20 metric tons represent a portion of a 34-metric-ton stockpile of weapons-grade plutonium that Washington pledged to eliminate under a 2000 non-proliferation agreement with Moscow. Specific details about the proposed allocation, industry responsibilities, and the timing of the rollout had not been previously disclosed.

The DOE, while not confirming the draft plan, said in a brief statement that it is “evaluating a variety of strategies to build and strengthen domestic supply chains for nuclear fuel, including plutonium,” in line with Trump’s directive.

The policy shift comes as the administration seeks to bolster the domestic energy sector, with electricity demand climbing for the first time in two decades due largely to the surge in data centers driven by artificial intelligence technologies.

Still, the idea of recycling surplus plutonium has drawn scepticism from nuclear safety experts. A similar program to convert the material into mixed-oxide (MOX) reactor fuel collapsed in 2018 when the Trump administration terminated a costly project that was expected to exceed $50 billion.

Currently, surplus plutonium is stored at high-security facilities such as the Savannah River Site in South Carolina, the Pantex Plant in Texas, and Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico. With a half-life of 24,000 years, the material requires strict safety protocols and specialised equipment for handling.

Until Trump’s order in May, the U.S. disposal strategy involved blending the plutonium with inert materials and burying it at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP), an underground repository in New Mexico—a process the DOE estimated would cost around $20 billion.

Critics argue the administration is repeating past mistakes. “Trying to convert this material into reactor fuel is insanity,” said Edwin Lyman, a nuclear physicist at the Union of Concerned Scientists. “It would entail trying to repeat the disastrous MOX fuel program and hoping for a different result. The excess plutonium is a dangerous waste product, and DOE should stick to the safer, more secure, and far cheaper plan to dilute and directly dispose of it in WIPP.”

So he sought refuge elsewhere: a large green space, down near the lakefront, that he could stroll to.

“Unfortunately,” Bibb said, “that’s not the case for many of our residents in the city of Cleveland.”

A native of Cleveland, Bibb was elected the 58th mayor of the city in 2021. Immediately after taking office, he took inspiration from the “15-minute city” concept of urban design, an idea that envisions people reaching their daily necessities — work, grocery stores, pharmacies — within 15 minutes by walking, biking, or taking public transit. That reduces dependence on cars, and also slashes carbon emissions and air pollution. In Cleveland, Bibb’s goal is to put all residents within a 10-minute walk of a green space by the year 2045, by converting abandoned lots to parks and other efforts.

Cleveland is far from alone in its quest to adapt to a warming climate. As American cities have grown in size and population and gotten hotter, they — not the federal government — have become crucibles for climate action: Cities are electrifying their public transportation, forcing builders to make structures more energy efficient, and encouraging rooftop solar. Together with ambitious state governments, hundreds of cities large and small are pursuing climate action plans — documents that lay out how they will reduce emissions and adapt to extreme weather — with or without support from the feds. Cleveland’s plan, for instance, calls for all its commercial and residential buildings to reach net-zero emissions by 2050.

For local leaders, climate action has grown all the more urgent since the Trump administration has been boosting fossil fuels and threatening to sue states to roll back environmental regulations. Last week, Republicans in the House passed a budget bill that would end nearly all the clean energy tax credits from the Biden administration’s signature climate law, the Inflation Reduction Act. “Because Donald Trump is in the White House again, it’s going to be up to mayors and governors to really enact and sustain the momentum around addressing climate change at the local level,” said Bibb, who formerly chaired Climate Mayors, a bipartisan group of nearly 350 mayors.

City leaders can move much faster than federal agencies, and are more in-tune with what their people actually want, experts said. “They’re on the ground and they’re hearing from their residents every day, so they have a really good sense of what the priorities are,” said Kate Johnson, regional director for North America at C40 Cities, a global network of nearly 100 mayors fighting climate change. “You see climate action really grounded in the types of things that are going to help people.”

Shifting from a reliance on fossil fuels to clean energy isn’t just about reducing a city’s carbon emissions, but about creating jobs and saving money — a tangible argument that mayors can make to their people. Bibb said a pilot program in Cleveland that helped low- to moderate-income households get access to free solar panels ended up reducing their utility bills by 60 percent. The biggest concern for Americans right now isn’t climate change, Bibb added. “It’s the cost of living, and so we have to marry these two things together,” he said. “I think mayors are in a very unique position to do that.”

To further reduce costs and emissions, cities like Seattle and Washington, D.C. are scrambling to better insulate structures, especially affordable housing, by installing double-paned windows and better insulation. In Boston last year, the city government started an Equitable Emissions Investment Fund, which awards money for projects that make buildings more efficient or add solar panels to their roofs. “We are in a climate where energy efficiency remains the number one thing that we can do,” said Oliver Sellers-Garcia, commissioner of the environment and Green New Deal director in the Boston government. “And there are so many other comfort and health benefits from being in an efficient, all-electric environment.”

To that end, cities are deploying loads of heat pumps, hyper-efficient appliances that warm and cool a space. New York City, for instance, is spending $70 million to install 30,000 of the appliances in its public housing. The ultimate goal is to have as many heat pumps as possible running in energy-efficient homes — along with replacing gas stoves with induction ranges — and drawing electricity from renewables.

Metropolises like Los Angeles and Pittsburgh are creating new green spaces, which reduce urban temperatures and soak up rainwater to prevent flooding. A park is a prime example of “multisolving”: one intervention that fixes a bunch of problems at once. Another is deploying electric vehicle chargers in underserved neighborhoods, as Cleveland is doing, and making their use free for residents. This encourages the adoption of those vehicles, which reduces carbon emissions and air pollution. That, in turn, improves public health in those neighborhoods, which tend to have a higher burden of pollution than richer areas.

Elizabeth Sawin, director of the Multisolving Institute, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit, said that these efforts will be more important than ever as the Trump administration cuts funding for health programs. “If health care for poor children is going to be depleted — with, say, Medicaid under threat — cities can’t totally fix that,” Sawin said. “But if they can get cleaner air in cities, they can at least have fewer kids who are struggling from asthma attacks and other respiratory illnesses.”

All this work — building parks, installing solar panels, weatherizing buildings — creates jobs, both within a city and in surrounding rural areas. Construction workers commute in, while urban farms tap rural growers for their expertise. And as a city gets more of its power from renewables, it can benefit counties far away: The largest solar facility east of the Mississippi River just came online in downstate Illinois, providing so much electricity to Chicago that the city’s 400 municipal buildings now run entirely on renewable power. “The economic benefits and the jobs aren’t just necessarily accruing to the cities — which might be seen as big blue cities,” Johnson said. “They’re buying their electric school buses from factories in West Virginia, and they’re building solar and wind projects in rural areas.”

So cities aren’t just preparing themselves for a warmer future, but helping accelerate a transition to renewables and spreading economic benefits across the American landscape. “We as elected officials have to do a better job of articulating how this important part of public policy is connected to the everyday lived experience,” Bibb said. “Unfortunately, my party has done a bad job of that. But I think as mayors, we are well positioned to make that case at the local level.”",https://dxu6k2kio89d8.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/13131421/cleveland-metropark.webp,N,,2025-08-23 09:00:23.577860

The second, regional environmental justice law center Midwest Environmental Advocates, won a July case concerning Wisconsin public records law.
Wisconsin has pledged to transition to 100% carbon-free electricity by 2050, but today still obtains three-quarters of its electricity from fossil fuels.
“We’ve argued that the fossil fuel pollution and climate impacts resulting from the approval of fossil fuel power plants is harming the plaintiff’s health, their homes, their property and their safety, and ultimately violating those constitutional rights to security and health,” Bellinger said.
Donald Trump’s policies have made youth climate action even more important, particularly at the state level, said Kaarina.","Fifteen young climate advocates, aged eight to 17, on Friday sued the state of Wisconsin over its pro-fossil fuel policies.

The case provides the opportunity for state officials to “make the correct step to decarbonize Wisconsin” because of the “climate harms they’ve caused youth”, said Kaarina, 17, who is the lead plaintiff in the lawsuit.

Kaarina grew up in the state’s Vernon county along the Mississippi River. But in 2023, a large boulder rolled into her backyard and knocked over trees.

Concerned for their safety, her family decided to relocate, but could not find an affordable home in the county that was safe from floods, which the climate crisis has made more common and severe. They were forced to move an hour north to La Crosse county.

Incidents like the one Kaarina experienced are occurring more frequently in Wisconsin, as winter thawing and subsequent refreezing cycles, known as “freeze-thaw events”, are increasing due to global heating. If it weren’t for the fossil fuel-driven climate crisis, Kaarina believes, her fate might have been different, as the boulder that tumbled toward her home would probably have never become dislodged.

“I had to move away from the childhood I planned to live in my entire life and enjoy with my own children,” said Kaarina, who is using only her first name because she is a minor.

The “incredibly traumatic and life-changing experience” helped inspire her to join the case, she said.

The new lawsuit was filed by two non-profit law firms. The first, Our Children’s Trust, notched a landmark 2023 win in a Montana case when a judge ruled that the state’s pro-fossil fuel policies violated young challengers’ state-given rights. The second, regional environmental justice law center Midwest Environmental Advocates, won a July case concerning Wisconsin public records law.

In the new lawsuit, plaintiffs are specifically targeting two Wisconsin laws governing the state’s public service commission, which regulates utilities. One prohibits the regulator from considering toxic and planet-heating air pollution when permitting new fossil fuel power plants, while another bars it from requiring utilities to increase the amount of electricity they obtain from carbon-free sources.

“These laws set up a system where the public service commission continues to approve fossil fuel power plants and cannot bring online more renewable energy,” said Nate Bellinger, supervising staff attorney at Our Children’s Trust.

Wisconsin has pledged to transition to 100% carbon-free electricity by 2050, but today still obtains three-quarters of its electricity from fossil fuels.

“The state legislature and the executive branch have both set goals and mandates to decarbonize the electricity sector,” said Bellinger. “These laws are getting in the way of that.”

The plaintiffs are aiming to have the two laws declared unconstitutional, which could ultimately lead to their overturning. The state’s constitution enshrines a right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, which the perpetuation of an oil and gas-based electricity sector impinges upon, the lawsuit argues.

“We’ve argued that the fossil fuel pollution and climate impacts resulting from the approval of fossil fuel power plants is harming the plaintiff’s health, their homes, their property and their safety, and ultimately violating those constitutional rights to security and health,” Bellinger said.

The challengers also say the constitution’s invocation of the public trust doctrine, which requires certain natural resources to be held in the government’s trust for the public’s benefit, should force Wisconsin to protect navigable waters for present and future generations, including from the climate crisis.

Climate impacts on Wisconsin are mounting, including not only flooding and rapid freeze-thaw cycles but also wildfires, ecosystem degradation and increasing extreme heat. Each of these is taking a toll on local youth, the lawsuit says.

“I coached tennis during the summer, but I recently did have to give it up due to such extreme weather and extreme climate events that don’t make it safe for me to be outside any more,” said Kaarina. “Also, my family enjoys gardening at my grandparents’ tree farm nearby, and my summers in the gardens have been cut short due to such extreme heat that does not make it safe to be outside, and extreme weather events that ultimately washes away the gardens that we’ve put so much incredible work into.”

Plaintiffs have also experienced asthma worsened by the burning of fossil fuels, while Indigenous challengers have seen their access to traditional foods hampered by ecosystem degradation and warming waters, the lawsuit says.

“Our clients are asking the court to uphold their right to a livable future,” said Tony Wilkin Gibart, executive director of Midwest Environmental Advocates. “This case is about whether they will inherit a future shaped by clean energy and a stable climate – or one burdened by fossil fuel pollution, extreme weather events, and growing threats to their health and safety.”

The lawsuit comes as the federal government rolls back a slew of environmental rules and worked to boost fossil fuels. In May, Our Children’s Trust sued the Trump administration for some of its anti-environmental executive orders; the case will have a two-day evidentiary hearing next month.

Donald Trump’s policies have made youth climate action even more important, particularly at the state level, said Kaarina.

“There’s very many dark things going on in our world right now, and especially in our federal government,” she said. “However, I don’t think that that should squish the light that is in youth.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/461488f3029cdc4dd1063e0e5ec3608f6d43f548/586_0_3828_3063/master/3828.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=299df2010bf842a61678f6657695fcb8",N,,2025-08-23 06:59:22.181122
,American Energy,2025-08-23 10:23:29+00:00,www.cbsnews.com,Why utility bills are rapidly rising in some states - CBS News,Tracy J.  Wholf,,,,,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/why-utility-bills-are-rapidly-rising-in-some-states/,"One example — gas turbines are extremely scarce right now, and that's holding up the expansion of natural gas power plants.
But the Trump administration has enacted policies to curtail new clean energy projects and instead foster greater reliance on fossil fuels.
Approving and permitting new clean energy projects has become increasingly difficult, taking away a valuable asset from energy providers at a critical time.
""By slowing clean energy deployment, the Administration is directly fueling cost increases,"" Jason Grumet, CEO of the American Clean Power Association, said in a statement.
Grumet cited EIA data and noted, ""The top four clean energy states are seeing prices decline this year, while the 10 states with the least renewable power all face rising costs.""","If you noticed your utility bill has gone up this summer, you're not alone. On average, electricity costs are 5.5% higher today than they were a year ago, according to the latest federal data, and natural gas is up 13.8%.

Nearly 60 utility companies are set to increase electricity rates this year by more than $38 billion, affecting more than 57 million Americans, according to analysis from the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank.

President Trump recently commented on the rising prices, blaming them on renewable power. He wrote on Truth Social that renewables were ""THE SCAM OF THE CENTURY!"" And he vowed he would not approve wind and solar projects.

But higher rates are largely a result of higher demand, and that's being driven by the rapid expansion of artificial intelligence, oil and gas drilling, space heating and electrified forms of transportation — all technologies that require immense amounts of power, according to Rob Gramlich, president of Grid Strategies, a D.C. based energy consultancy firm, ""When supply is scarce, then prices go up,"" he said.

Gramlich says that after 25 years of a flat demand for energy and a dip during the pandemic, demand rose once economic activity picked up after the pandemic was over.

Russia's invasion of Ukraine has also played a role in higher costs, disrupting international energy supply chains and causing rates to go up in the U.S. Rapid growth in data centers and newer electrified forms of technology mean the nation will need 15% more capacity — or 120 gigawatts — by the end of the decade to keep pace, Gramlich estimated.

The increasing demand is a big reason why the U.S. Energy Information Administration expects residential electricity rates to increase steadily by as much as 18% in the next few years, far outstripping the annual inflation rate of about 2.7%.

The fastest way to bring rates down would be to increase supply, but there are challenges.

U.S. falling behind on transmission

Gramlich, in recent testimony before Congress, said there's no shortage of fuel to add to the grid — it's a shortage of transmission that's the major problem.

At the end of 2023, there were more than 2,600 gigawatts of energy waiting to get connected, representing over twice the current installed capacity of the U.S. power grid, according to the Lawrence Berkeley National Lab. And 95% of it was generated by solar, wind, and battery storage.

To meet growing electricity needs, the U.S. needs to expand transmission systems by 60% by 2030, and even that may need to triple by 2050, according to a 2022 report by the Department of Energy.

""If we can get a lot of transmission built, then I think we can meet the AI-driven data center demands,"" Gramlich said.

AI data centers consume far more power from the grid than regular data centers, says Norman Bashir, a fellow at MIT's Climate and Sustainability Consortium, where researchers are studying the impact of generative AI on the grid.

""AI data centers are much more power intensive,"" Bashir told CBS News Boston last month. ""So, if you have a normal data center, an AI data center would be up to 10 times more power intensive.""

Role of tariffs and equipment shortages

Beyond the transmission backlog, Gramlich says tariffs and equipment shortages are making energy projects more expensive. One example — gas turbines are extremely scarce right now, and that's holding up the expansion of natural gas power plants.

""The price of an actual turbine has almost tripled,"" Gramlich said. And the wait time for a gas turbine is around three or four years — even as long as seven, according to a May analysis by S&P Global.

Energy sources

Over the past decade, the nation's energy mix has increasingly grown to favor natural gas and renewables, like wind, solar and hydropower, that have become much cheaper to produce. New nuclear plants won't be on line before 2030, Gramlich said, and coal is becoming less economically viable because of maintenance and update costs required to address pollution concerns.

""That leaves wind and solar and battery storage that can help in this decade,"" Gramlich told CBS News.

But the Trump administration has enacted policies to curtail new clean energy projects and instead foster greater reliance on fossil fuels. Approving and permitting new clean energy projects has become increasingly difficult, taking away a valuable asset from energy providers at a critical time.

""If things keep going like this, [utility bills] are gonna be higher next year,"" Gramlich said.

Trump energy policies projected to raise prices

Upon returning to office, Mr. Trump issued a ""National Energy Emergency"" executive order, arguing the country needs ""reliable, diversified, and affordable supply of energy to drive our Nation's manufacturing, transportation, agriculture, and defense industries, and to sustain the basics of modern life and military preparedness.""

Most of the actions tied to that order have gutted renewable energy generation and are bolstering fossil fuel development.

The passage of Trump's signature legislation, One Big Beautiful Bill Act, is expected to make energy more expensive, impact jobs, and make it more difficult to meet rising energy demand, according to analysis by Energy Innovation, a nonpartisan energy and climate policy think tank.

OBBBA will change the tax code, increasing generation costs, resulting in a drop in power generation capacity of 340 gigawatts by 2035, says Michael O'Boyle, acting policy team director of Energy Innovation in an email to CBS News. To put that in perspective, 1 gigawatt typically powers 750,000 homes, so 340 gigawatts could power about 255 million homes.

O'Boyle estimates wholesale energy prices will increase by 74% by 2035, resulting in a $170 annual increase in the average household energy bill. Some 760,000 jobs could be lost by 2030, and the states that are expected to see the biggest impacts on energy cost increases and job losses from the OBBBA are South Carolina, Florida, Texas, Kentucky and North Carolina.

The Energy Department criticized the analysis and its support of renewables arguing, ""The OBBBA ensures taxpayers will no longer be forced to subsidize intermittent energy sources like wind and solar – subsidies that have only resulted in more expensive, less reliable energy,"" said Ben Dietderich, the department's press secretary and chief spokesman, in an email to CBS News.

Ending Biden-era clean energy policies

Since he returned to office, Mr. Trump has been dismantling Biden-era clean energy policies, resulting in the termination of more than $22 billion in renewable energy projects, according to an analysis by the environmental policy firm E2.

""Unfortunately, the president and Congress is making it harder for Americans to have access to the cheapest, cleanest, quickest to deploy power there is,"" said Bob Keefe, E2's executive director.

""By slowing clean energy deployment, the Administration is directly fueling cost increases,"" Jason Grumet, CEO of the American Clean Power Association, said in a statement. Grumet cited EIA data and noted, ""The top four clean energy states are seeing prices decline this year, while the 10 states with the least renewable power all face rising costs.""

Trump admin. keeping fossil fuel generation alive

To address rising energy demand, the Energy Department has ordered some utility companies to keep coal power plants open beyond their retirement dates, an action that could cost more than $3.1 billion a year by 2028, according to analysis by Gramlich's firm, Grid Strategies.

""These coal plants are basically uneconomic in the market. Each year, they incur tens of millions of dollars of maintenance just to stay operating,"" said Gramlich.

Those costs to extend the life of coal plants will be borne by ratepayers, according to a ruling by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.

Coal plants are generally planned for retirement when their operating cost exceeds their expected revenue or their value to the electric grid, the EIA has pointed out. Coal-fired plants, which produce high levels of CO2 emissions, have been under pressure to be phased out in many states, in particular, those with clean energy goals. According to the EIA, natural gas and clean energy sources are providing a growing share of the nation's electricity, while coal has been waning. By the end of 2023, the maximum potential power plant output for coal was 15.2%, down from 45% in 1990.

If additional fossil fuel-based plants delay retirement dates — 28% were expected to be retired by 2035 — the bill to ratepayers could grow to more than $6 billion.

Still, Energy Secretary Chris Wright supports the administration's efforts to keep fossil fuel generation online longer.",https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/08/23/8ed5da1d-c088-4eee-9298-f6ff6d981d50/thumbnail/1200x630/0145da0dfa18b834d23fca70cf53bd7b/gettyimages-1233323745.jpg,N,,2025-08-23 06:59:26.664822

After careful review, EPA said it is granting full exemptions to 63 petitions, granting partial exemptions to 77 petitions, denying 28 petitions and determining seven petitions to be ineligible.
Under the U.S. Department of Energy’s 2011 Small Refinery Study, small refineries would have been denied any relief even if demonstrating partial hardship, EPA noted.
Concurrent with this decision, EPA will update the RFS Small Refinery Exemption website to reflect its action on the 175 petitions.
The exemptions granted today should have little or no effect on current and future levels of renewable fuel production and use.","The Environmental Protection Agency announced Aug. 22 it is acting on the backlog of 175 Small Refinery Exemption (SRE) petitions from 38 small refineries for the 2016-2024 Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) compliance years.

After careful review, EPA said it is granting full exemptions to 63 petitions, granting partial exemptions to 77 petitions, denying 28 petitions and determining seven petitions to be ineligible.

EPA policy set through the 2020 renewable volume obligations (RVO) rulemaking grants partial relief (a 50% exemption) when a small refinery can demonstrate that it faces partial economic hardship. Under the U.S. Department of Energy’s 2011 Small Refinery Study, small refineries would have been denied any relief even if demonstrating partial hardship, EPA noted.

With the Aug. 22 action, the agency said it is ""getting the SRE program back on track with an approach that recognizes some small refineries are impacted more significantly than others and that EPA’s relief should reflect those differences."" Concurrent with this decision, EPA will update the RFS Small Refinery Exemption website to reflect its action on the 175 petitions.

At the same time, EPA is reaffirming a policy to return RFS compliance credits, or Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs), previously retired for compliance when a small refinery receives an exemption for a prior compliance year.

Under the RFS program, RINs have a two-year window for use, covering the compliance year in which they were generated and the next. Therefore, while 2022 and earlier vintage RINs are not eligible for use to meet the open 2024 compliance obligations or future obligations, these vintage RINs can be used to demonstrate compliance for prior compliance years consistent with their two-year window, according to EPA. Ultimately, this means that the 2022 and earlier vintage RINs will not affect the number of RINs available to meet 2024 and future compliance obligations and are not expected to impact demand for biofuels.

In addition, EPA said it will soon be submitting a draft supplemental proposed rule to the Office of Management & Budget on the proposed reallocations of exempted volumes for the 2023 and later compliance years. ""EPA does not plan to propose reallocation of any of the exempted volumes for any SREs from 2016 to 2022 in light of the limitation on their potential use.""

EPA will also be providing updated information on how it intends to forecast SREs for 2026 and 2027 in the context of establishing percentage standards for those years. The proposed adjustments will help ensure that refineries blend the intended volumes of renewable fuel into the nation’s fuel supply in 2026 and 2027 after accounting for the SREs granted for 2023 and 2024 in these actions and projected SREs granted for 2025-2027 in the “Set 2” proposal. The supplemental proposal will seek to balance the goals of the RFS in supporting the production and use of renewable fuels while taking into account economic impacts, following the law and ensuring opportunity for stakeholder comment.

In June, EPA announced its proposed RFS volume requirements for 2026 and 2027. This Set 2 proposal ensures the RFS program remains true to the original intent of Congress to increase the use of homegrown biofuels to support American energy dependence and rural economies.

EPA is currently reviewing the input it received during the comment period, which closed Aug. 8, 2025, and is working on a final regulation. Upon publication of a supplemental proposed rule on potential reallocation of the 2023 and later compliance year exempted volumes, EPA will accept public comments on this supplemental proposal.

The Renewable Fuels Association (RFA) said in a statement it questions whether the refineries truly faced economic hardship but feels ""EPA’s approach for implementing these exemptions appears reasonable and should not disrupt the marketplace or reduce actual renewable fuel consumption.""

RFA president and chief executive officer Geoff Cooper added this approach should be ""minimally disruptive to the marketplace and affirms the agency’s intent to reallocate renewable fuel volumes lost to SREs. We appreciate that EPA is focused on an approach that maintains stability in the marketplace and ensures finalized annual volumes under the RFS are maintained. The exemptions granted today should have little or no effect on current and future levels of renewable fuel production and use. It is critical, however, that the renewable fuel blending volumes associated with SREs for 2023 and 2024 are fully reallocated.

The American Biogas Council, which represents more than 400 companies all along the U.S. biogas supply chain, issued a statement applauding the timing of EPA’s actions on the exemptions and RVOs. Executive director Patrick Serfass said, “Issuing SREs now, before the RVOs are finalized, allows the EPA to balance both levers in the RFS to make sure they work together harmoniously and promote the healthy function of the RINs market. The RVOs set demand for the RINs market, and SREs decrease demand. Announcing the SREs now gives the EPA the opportunity to follow the recommendation from the American Biogas Council and other renewable fuel producers to increase RVOs, which would increase demand and balance out the impact of issuing SREs.

“Without an increase in RVOs, RIN credit prices could crash, creating a harmful economic ripple effect across rural America. The EPA can make this all work together to protect farmers and rural communities, who depend on a strong, stable RFS program,” Serfass added.",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/blte5a51c2d28bbcc9c/bltc363037a0fa004e7/68a8eadfae7db00fa3fa2a2a/Ethanol_plant_in_SD_Aerial_View_-Getty_Images.jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2025-08-23 12:03:11.404993

That is down from its prior outlook of it turning a modest gross profit in 2025.","After two straight quarters of positive gross margins, Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ: RIVN) returned to producing negative gross margins in the second quarter. This largely appears to be due to higher material costs, as China's cutback on the export of heavy rare-earth metals in the quarter disrupted supply chains and drove up the cost of electric vehicle (EV) production.

Meanwhile, a reduction of regulatory tax credits will be a headwind going forward, as the $7,500 U.S. federal EV tax credit will expire at the end of September. As a result, Rivian lowered its expectations for 2025 regulatory credit sales from a prior outlook of $300 million down to $160 million. Tax credits are pure gross margin, so that reduction hurts. Tariffs will also be a headwind, with Rivian estimating that tariffs will cost it a couple of thousand dollars per vehicle.

The automaker said it is now looking for gross profits to be about breakeven for the full year. That is down from its prior outlook of it turning a modest gross profit in 2025. Gross margin and gross profit are key metrics for Rivian, as it must be able to make its vehicles for less than it sells them for to even think about becoming profitable and generating free cash flow down the road.

Two weeks ago, the administration said it was reversing a Biden administration decision to approve the Lava Ridge Wind Project, a giant wind farm planned for southern Idaho.
In April, the Trump administration ordered a halt to work at Empire Wind, a $5 billion wind farm off the coast of Long Island that was already being built, without publicly providing a justification.
Equinor, the developer behind Empire Wind, recently said that those delays and other regulatory changes affecting U.S. offshore wind projects had cost the company nearly $1 billion.
Mr. Trump has been a critic of wind power for years, ever since he unsuccessfully tried to stop an offshore wind farm from being built in view of one of his Scottish golf courses.","The Trump administration on Friday ordered that all construction stop on Revolution Wind, a $4 billion wind farm off the coast of Rhode Island that is already mostly built.

The 65-turbine project had obtained all necessary permits from the Biden administration, and nearly 70 percent of the turbines have been installed. The developers behind the project had said it was on track to produce enough electricity for more than 350,000 homes in Rhode Island and Connecticut by next spring.

Matthew Giacona, the acting director of the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, issued a letter on Friday to Orsted, the Danish company building the wind farm, ordering it to “halt all ongoing activities” because of unspecified issues.

“In particular, BOEM is seeking to address concerns related to the protection of national security interests in the United States,” Mr. Giacona wrote, adding that Orsted “may not resume activities” until the agency has completed a review of the project.

The decision was first reported by The Daily Caller. The Interior Department declined to comment on the order to stop work on Revolution Wind.

In a statement, Orsted said that it was “evaluating all options to resolve the matter expeditiously,” including “potential legal proceedings.” The company said it still aimed to complete the project by next year.

Last week, Orsted said that it needed to raise an additional $9.4 billion to shore up its finances as it attempted to complete both Revolution Wind and Sunrise Wind, another large offshore wind project near Long Island, while contending with an industry downturn that has been exacerbated by President Trump’s opposition to wind farms.

“Orsted and our industry are in an extraordinary situation with the adverse market development in the U.S.,” said Rasmus Errboe, the company’s chief executive.

Connecticut Attorney General William Tong, a Democrat, said the state was “evaluating all legal options to protect Connecticut’s interests.”

“Trump wants to mothball billions of dollars in investment and cancel one of the best new sources of American-made, renewable energy,” Mr. Tong said. “Trump and his enablers will own the resulting cost increases for ratepayers.”

The Trump administration’s move against Revolution Wind is the latest in a series of its escalating attacks against the wind industry.

On Thursday, the Commerce Department opened a trade investigation into imported wind turbines and their components. The probe could result in further tariffs on the wind industry that could increase costs for offshore projects that are already underway.

Two weeks ago, the administration said it was reversing a Biden administration decision to approve the Lava Ridge Wind Project, a giant wind farm planned for southern Idaho. The administration said it had discovered “legal deficiencies” in the original approval but did not provide details.

The Interior Department had signaled last month that it would consider revoking federal permits for wind projects that opponents have sued over, even if those projects were already under construction.

In April, the Trump administration ordered a halt to work at Empire Wind, a $5 billion wind farm off the coast of Long Island that was already being built, without publicly providing a justification. After a month of negotiations with Gov. Kathy Hochul, Democrat of New York, the administration let Empire Wind move forward, but administration officials suggested that they had done so only after Ms. Hochul agreed to approve new gas pipelines in the state. Ms. Hochul has denied that any such deal was made.

Equinor, the developer behind Empire Wind, recently said that those delays and other regulatory changes affecting U.S. offshore wind projects had cost the company nearly $1 billion.

At the same time as it thwarts the wind industry, the Trump administration has taken several steps to boost oil and gas as well as coal, the dirtiest and most expensive fossil fuel when it comes to burning it for electricity.

The Energy Department on Thursday extended an emergency order compelling a Michigan coal-burning power plant to stay open past its retirement date. The department has issued several orders to keep coal plants running past their planned closure dates, even in cases where the operators never sought an extension and ratepayers would shoulder the costs of complying.

“This administration has it exactly backward,” said Kit Kennedy, managing director for power at the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group. “It’s trying to prop up clunky, polluting coal plants while doing all it can to halt the fastest-growing energy sources of the future — solar and wind power.”

Erik Milito, president of the National Ocean Industries Association, which represents offshore energy companies, said in a statement the Trump administration decision would kill jobs and hurt the U.S. economy.

“Revolution Wind is already under construction and nearly complete, representing years of planning, billions in private investment, and significant progress for America’s offshore energy supply chain,” he said, adding, “Any pause or uncertainty at this stage could ripple across jobs, contracts and communities already benefiting from the project.”

Green Oceans, a nonprofit group that has sued over the approvals of federal permits for Revolution Wind, praised the Trump administration’s move. “This decisive action demonstrates that the federal government finally recognizes the seriously flawed permitting process that allowed this project and others to move forward,” the group said in a statement.

Mr. Trump has been a critic of wind power for years, ever since he unsuccessfully tried to stop an offshore wind farm from being built in view of one of his Scottish golf courses. Mr. Trump has called the large turbines ugly and expensive and has insisted that offshore wind farms are killing endangered whales in the Atlantic Ocean, although scientists have said there is no evidence to support that claim.

The Biden administration had tried to accelerate the development of offshore wind, which is commonplace in Europe but barely exists in the United States, and approved nearly a dozen commercial-scale wind farms in the Atlantic Ocean. Yet some of those projects foundered as a result of soaring costs, high interest rates, supply chain delays and bursts of local opposition.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/01/multimedia/22cli-wind/22cli-wind-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-08-23 08:02:12.661688

Transcript

Cris Sheridan:

Joining us on the show today is Doomberg. He's one of the most popular writers on Substack, covering everything from energy and the economy to geopolitics. We will have a link to his Substack column where you can sign up and follow more of his work. Doomberg, thanks for coming on and speaking with us.

Doomberg:

Hey, great to be back with you.

Cris Sheridan:

So, Doomberg, we've covered a number of different topics with you over the years, including many of the things that I just mentioned: energy, the economy, and geopolitics. You have in your tagline how energy is life. However, when it comes to the major financial media news channels and the wider investment base, it seems that most people do not understand just how important energy is until they're forced to reckon with it.

Doomberg:

Yeah, absolutely. One of the great mysteries of our time is why so few macro analysts or geopolitical strategists start their analysis with energy. Energy should not be treated like any other commodity. It is vital to standards of living. It's vital to winning wars. The history of modern warfare can be traced through the lens of energy. Daniel Yergin has written some great books in this regard. And so, when you study, for example, the relative geopolitical positioning of, say, Russia and the United Kingdom, all you have to do is download a copy of the Statistical Review of World Energy and start making a few plots. And you see one is an energy superpower and the other is a flaccid energy vassal. Energy explains geopolitical tensions. Anytime we see a skirmish in a weird country involving great powers, it is almost always an oil pipeline, a gas pipeline, or a critical energy choke point. And so, physics is a great indicator of how things should be. It doesn't necessarily predict the future, but it tells you the direction of travel pretty accurately. And so, whenever we look at the world, we have a whole series of indicators on our Bloomberg dashboard that we look at every day. And you can kind of tell how the world is doing, where there are geopolitical hotspots, and so on. So, it's just a great place to start. When we launched Doomberg four and a half years ago, there weren't many people doing it, especially with the industrial lens that we brought to our writing. And so, it's been a success. We've obviously demonstrated product-market fit and are having a blast doing it.

Cris Sheridan:

And I want to dive into some of your recent pieces and also speak with you about a theme that came up this week on our show. Tell us a little bit from your viewpoint, given a lot of what you cover on your Substack column, about just how important energy is when it comes to overall competitiveness on the global stage.

Doomberg:

An electricity grid is a foundation for a developed economy. China has by far the largest and most sophisticated energy grid in the world, backed by a mountain of coal that it burns literally every day. More than half of all of the world's coal, I think it's 56%, is now burned by China. It's cheap, it's domestic, they stockpile it, and they produce two and a quarter times as much electricity as the US does, and it's growing quite rapidly. China is a very large country. It's a very impressive country. I competed against Chinese companies and sold into China during my career. I have a fair number of friends there and a pretty good understanding of the country. People in the West have this techno-arrogance about them when they look at countries like China, India, and Russia. These are very sophisticated countries. China does all manner of dirty tricks to achieve its geopolitical objectives. You should expect that your geopolitical opponents will behave that way and prepare accordingly. But yeah, among the many reasons why China has such a huge manufacturing base is the fact that it has such a large and sophisticated electricity grid. One of the plots that you can do when you look at the fate of a country is to plot how much electricity it produces. Take a look at the grid's reliability. You know, a 99% reliable grid is functionally useless for a developed economy. It needs to be far higher than that. 99.97 is the US target. They're held to what's known as a 1-in-10 standard: one day of outage over 10 years cumulatively. And so, China is leading the pack there. They're leading the pack in critical minerals. They're leading the pack in automotive production. If it weren't for tariffs, BYD would put the big automakers out of business overnight. They can't compete with that local cost structure. So, they've been strategic, they've been effective. And we did a whole presentation on China last year called ""The Year of the Dragon: China through the Lens of Energy."" Back to my first answer about the importance of energy: if you just look at China through the lens of energy, you see the weaving of their strategy with tactics, and it's pretty self-evident.

Cris Sheridan:

Yeah. And now they're building the world's largest dam. And I know you recently wrote about that. Tell us a bit about the Maidong Dam they're building based on your analysis and some of the facts that we see there.

Doomberg:

Yeah. So, we wrote a piece a couple of weeks ago, as you mentioned, called ""Five Dams in Tibet."" And it's really a colossal project. It's been getting a fair bit of print coverage in the mainstream media. We decided to write about it. The largest dam in the world right now is in China. It's called the Three Gorges Dam, and it is rated to produce 22.5 gigawatts of power. Just to give you some benchmark, that's more than 10 times the size of Diablo Canyon in California, California's last remaining nuclear power plant. And they're going to build five run-of-the-river dams in Tibet. And the combined capacity of those dams is going to be 60 gigawatts, which is just mind-boggling--two-thirds the rated capacity of the US's entire nuclear power fleet in one project. It's going to be a massive project. It's going to affect global demand for diesel, cement, truck tires--you name it, it's going to be a boom. Now, one of the things that's interesting about this project is that it is a run-of-the-river dam, not an impoundment hydroelectric dam. There's a big difference between those two. Run-of-the-river dams are baseload power but typically not very dispatchable. Even though this dam, because it's run-of-the-river, should have less of an environmental footprint--there's no big flooding upstream of the dam to worry about--it won't be as dispatchable. It won't serve to stabilize the grid in a way that a standard hydroelectric dam does. But this is a really fascinating project. I don't doubt for a second that they're going to get it done, and then it's going to work.

Cris Sheridan:

You were talking about how it's supposed to be 60 gigawatts of power, and correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe that is the equivalent of roughly 60 nuclear reactors.

Doomberg:

Right. Yeah. And you know, an AP1000 reactor is about a gigawatt. Now, nuclear power reactors tend to run at a higher capacity factor. So, you have to consider that the rated capacity and the amount of power it produces--you know, we would probably anticipate that this dam would produce at about a 50 or 60% capacity factor, and much depends on the rainy season and all that stuff. But nonetheless, it is a mind-bogglingly big project, and China is probably the only country in the world capable of pulling it off from an engineering perspective.

Cris Sheridan:

The clearest example that we can see where they have absolutely taken the lead over the US and every other country is when you look at the amount of electricity and power that they are generating domestically--no other nation even comes close at this point. How important is this in terms of setting them up for being the next superpower?

Doomberg:

Better still, they've tricked much of the Western world into buying solar panels and wind turbines while they're burning the world's coal at a lower price than it would otherwise be because demand is going down in the West. They take their energy very, very seriously. Here's China's strategy in a nutshell: whenever they decide to get strategic about an industry that they're not naturally endowed with, they find the earliest part of the value chain that they can dominate through financial brute force. So, China is short on oil. It is the world's largest refiner of oil as measured by capacity. So, if China loses its oil, its neighbors pay a hefty price too, because many countries rely on Chinese exports, for example. And so, they're pretty strategic about things. The US used to be this way. The US built the National Highway System in the '50s, and they used to build stuff. The US used to build stuff--it doesn't anymore. Outside of the primary energy companies, which are cutting-edge technological superpowers that actually build real stuff on a massive scale, the rest of the US is lagging significantly. And this is being exposed in the war in Ukraine. Of course, that is a war of attrition that NATO has lost. And it lost it because it doesn't make stuff anymore. It doesn't make its own weapons. Eighty percent of the US military-industrial complex supply chains pass through China at some point. Of course, China helping Russia has defeated NATO in Ukraine. And this is what happens when you hollow out your manufacturing base in the name of quarterly results as pressured by Wall Street. And China doesn't have those issues.

Cris Sheridan:

You know, it's very interesting because when we think about how China is just so far ahead in terms of electricity production--again, they're building this dam now, which is the equivalent of 60 nuclear reactors. That is a lot of electricity that's going to be produced from this world's largest dam that they're building. You think that they are going to be successful in doing this, but the US has so much catching up to do now at this point. Trump is trying to change that. He's trying to streamline the regulatory process, fast-track nuclear power development. There are a number of things that he's doing, but I don't think--at least from my point of view, and I'd like to get your thoughts on this--can the US actually do what's necessary? Can it catch up? It seems like it is so far behind now at this point.

Doomberg:

I'm a little more optimistic than that. If you wanted to make the bullish case, the US is a global energy giga-power. It is by far the largest producer of oil and natural gas in the world. It has an enormous coal reserve base. Natural gas in the US--obviously, it's a very regionalized market, prices vary--but on balance, natural gas in the US is the cheapest, cleanest hydrocarbon base in the world. There are an enormous number of cogeneration facilities in the US; these facilities produce electricity and steam, typically for heavy industry. The US has the resources. Whether it needs to catch up to China is a whole question--I don't know why we always assume that to compete globally, you have to bring other countries down. I mean, the Western Hemisphere is endowed with so much energy that if Trump could just get out of this war in Ukraine, keep the peace in the Middle East, and come to a détente with China, there's plenty to do on this side of the world. We published a piece this morning called ""Blooming Flower."" We were talking about how, once a critical mass of super-majors ends up in a location, it tends to branch out and produce more and more oil. And that's happening at the interface between the Caribbean and the northern bit of South America, namely Guyana, Trinidad and Tobago, and Suriname, so there's plenty here. Greenland, Arctic Argentina has a massive shale resource that's just now coming to life--it could be on par with the Permian by the time it's done, assuming that Milei gets their economic house in order. There's no need to catch up to China. The US is a wealthy country. It can make stuff again, and it should. And kudos to Trump for trying. But also, I think Trump is a bit delusional about the current state of the US and how prepared it is to compete on the world stage with China and Russia. Right now, 1985 isn't walking through that door, but I do think that Trump's instincts are correct. And so, yeah, it's going to be fascinating to watch.

Cris Sheridan:

You mentioned this earlier, but where does grid stability fit into this conversation? Of course, we did see a major outage in Europe, and the US is increasingly facing more and more outages, and those outages are lasting longer than they have in the past. Many guests have commented that our grid goes back, you know, 100 years or so and is highly dilapidated. So, tell us a little bit about the problem the US faces from an electrical grid standpoint. Of course, we did note earlier that China has now taken the lead in terms of the amount of electricity produced in their country, head and shoulders above any other nation. But if you wouldn't mind, comment a little bit about the US and the issues it faces when it comes to its own electrical grid.

Doomberg:

A couple of things. The first step is recognizing that you have the problem, and Trump gets full grades for that. Also, we're at a turning point in the intermittent renewables debate--just in time, hopefully. The US Northeast is struggling with its ""oh, you know what"" moment. You know, as a fundamental rule of thumb for people who aren't as familiar with how the grid actually operates, we put a promotional presentation out between now and the end of August. Anybody who subscribes to Doomberg gets a free copy of a presentation called ""Cocktail Party Trivia: Winning the Renewables Debate with Friends and Family."" Anytime intermittency begins to rub up against dispatchability as far as share on the grid goes, things start to break, and it's just no more complicated than that. So, natural gas is like the perfect fuel for a grid because it is both baseload--you could run it 24/7--but it is also very dispatchable. Grid operators can perfectly match supply with demand by toggling natural gas plants in a matter of minutes. And grid reliability is a subset of grid operators' ability to perfectly match supply with demand. And when you have intermittent renewables like wind and solar that the grid must make room for when they decide to show up, and the grid must have backup for when the wind doesn't blow or it's nighttime, when you get enough--typically, say, 10 to 15%, as California is proving--you have these huge swings in intermittency that the grid operators have to account for. And then, the final point on grid stability is that wind and solar are known as inverter-based resources, whereas nuclear power plants, coal plants, and natural gas plants have giant spinning turbines. And those giant spinning turbines impart upon the grid what's known as inertia. And inertia allows grid operators to ride out small faults that might otherwise cascade because operating a grid is a deeply nonlinear complex system upon which linearity is enforced in part by these giant spinning turbines. And when you have an insufficient amount of inertia on the grid, you end up being susceptible to what happened in Spain. A small fault at one solar facility cascaded through the entire system. There was insufficient inertia because, hey, it's sunny in Spain, and they've got so much solar that basically the entire grid was running on renewables. Well, there you go--the grid collapsed. And so, why people don't see this or understand this is a great mystery. We're going to see it happen in Australia, by the way. It's going to happen in China, we think, this year. We note with great interest that Chinese solar is penetrating around 8 to 10% of the grid, I believe. And suddenly, they put a pause in May on new approvals because it just becomes, I mean, the laws of physics are the laws of physics. The amount of batteries you would need to install to back up an entire grid for any period of time is absurd--it just can't happen. And so, many challenges with the grid. But to your original question, Trump has gutted much of the Inflation Reduction Act and the subsidies for wind and solar, unfairly, we think. He has destroyed the US wind sector. I just think that this incredible regulatory whiplash is unfair and is not conducive to capital formation. On balance, because the wind sector goes from ""you must build 30 gigawatts of offshore wind"" to basically the whole thing gets shut down in a matter of years. And the last point is the length of heavy industry's capital planning cycle is longer than the US political cycle. And that sets up for whiplash. And so, if a Democrat wins in '28, all of these pro-growth investments that Trump has been making would pivot. And so, it is risky. But you know, you have to start somewhere.

Cris Sheridan:

There has been a growing recognition this decade, I would say, that nuclear power needs to play a much more prominent role. China and India have recognized this, and they've been pushing forward and building nuclear, as many other nations have. The US is now starting to recognize this. Again, like we mentioned, Trump is attempting to move in this direction. There's bipartisan support behind it as well--it's not just Trump. So, we're seeing an effort in that direction. What is your point of view? How fast could we realistically phase in nuclear power and alleviate some of these bottlenecks that we see with electricity?

Doomberg:

Yeah, that's a political choice for sure. If France could build a power grid that has 70% nuclear on it 50 years ago, surely the US could do it today. The US has 90 operating reactors or so--93, I think, is the number. But China's putting up nuclear power plants at a record clip at an enviable price. But the Koreans can do it--the Koreans are quite competitive with the Chinese. Russia is actually the leading exporter of nuclear technology in the world. Very few people understand that, but Rosatom is a very widely respected constructor of nuclear reactors. And they provide the enriched uranium for them and help maintain them over the decades. Nuclear is great because it is a baseload power. It is not very dispatchable, as France is now finding out, because France has been loading its grid with solar and forcing nuclear power plants to react, and that's causing maintenance issues and other troubles with the grid. And you know, of course, France, too, is now putting a pause on new solar rollout because they realize after this stuff is built that you actually need a grid that's able to use it. There's a world where Russia, China, Korea, the US, and Canada are generating gigawatt reactors at a record clip. I think we're going to see China overtake the US in nuclear energy soon--by soon, I mean 15 years or so. So, we'll see. But the US--it's the time it takes to build a reactor and the cost it takes to build a reactor are overtly political choices. They just are. And judicial constraints, permitting constraints--Canada, Ontario, built out its nuclear reactors 50 years ago. Again, there's nothing technologically difficult about doing it. It is just a matter of political will.

Cris Sheridan:

Well, how long does it take on average? I mean, you did cite that, but regulatory hurdles obviously play a major role in that timeline. But, you know, I mean, I believe it's on the order of six to eight years on average here in the US--10 years. Whereas China, it's probably closer to what, like three to five?

Doomberg:

Yeah, you could probably get it done start to finish with political will in four years. I think the Japanese kind of proved that out. China's going a little bit faster than that. But let's say the last, you know, the most recent US build in Georgia was a catastrophe. It was wildly over budget and took way, way too long to make. If the US could get down to about five years, I think it would be quite a feat. I know that Secretary Wright has nuclear ambitions as part of the Trump administration. The real challenge is the nuclear industry doesn't do itself many favors. You know, the free market works most of the time. It fails in two regards: it fails in properly measuring environmental impact, and it fails in national security as well. So, there's, like, China is just going to build nuclear reactors. And as our friend Mark Nelson likes to say, these reactors will live forever--like, 80 years from now, the current reactor fleet of the US will still be operating. These are forever factories of electricity, basically. And so, it's kind of like building the US highway system. If Trump could get 10 or 15 reactors on the go before his term is over and they have some reasonable completion, I think that would be a lasting legacy. There is a sort of cost curve of where the next reactors would go. And you would start with sites that are already approved to expand and are already, you know--let's say a site was approved to build six reactors, and there's two reactors on it. You put the next four there before you would start a completely new greenfield site. So, the problem that the nuclear industry has is it hasn't really settled on a standard design, and it has fallen for the trap that environmentalists have set for them, which is they are trying to solve political problems with technology. So, let's just take a little sidebar and talk about fusion for a second. Fusion is a giant waste of time and money. The two problems it purports to solve are fake: nuclear waste and meltdown risk. Those aren't real problems--they're concocted problems by Malthusian environmentalists. I'll just give you two examples. The first is nuclear waste is not waste--it's partially spent fuel that can be reprocessed. The vast majority of the embodied energy in a spent nuclear fuel rod is still there. And we view nuclear waste as a gift to future engineers because they can just pass them through a fast-breeder reactor and recycle them and bring them back online, and they don't have to mine the uranium and enrich the uranium--it's all just right there. And then, the second is this whole nuclear meltdown risk and the catastrophic overreaction to radiation that the environmentalists have pulled off. A giant dam in China collapsed in 1975--the name of that dam escapes me, but it was, you know, a freak storm of the century. And a bunch of dams collapsed downstream of that one, and the flooding was horrific. And the estimated number of deaths was somewhere between 50,000 to 250,000. One person died from Fukushima four years after the accident because of cancer--a tragedy for that one person, to be sure. When that dam collapsed in China, did we go about deconstructing all the other hydroelectric dams around the world? No. And by the way, more people have died falling off wind turbines while servicing them than have died from Fukushima. You know, energy is all about trade-offs. And so, fusion then solves two fake problems. And by the time fusion is ready--it is perpetually four decades away from being ready--the same environmentalists who have tricked everybody about fission would concoct fake problems to obstruct the deployment of fusion. That's how it's going to go. So, just take the best of 1980s technology and build it over and over and over and over and over again. That is the slightly obvious answer. If we had our way, the US would build CANDU reactors--beautiful design, safe to operate, off you go. And, you know, but Westinghouse, AP1000, whatever--it doesn't matter. Pick the design. Who cares what it is? Pick the Chinese reactors, pick the Russian reactors--they're amazing feats of engineering. If fission was invented today, it would be hailed as a civilization-saving technology. And if aliens visited us today, they'd be puzzled as to why there aren't fission reactors all over the place. It really is a testimony to the power of Malthusian environmentalists that nuclear has been painted with such a bad brush.

Cris Sheridan:

Those are some really good points that you made. And I'd like to get your thoughts on the race over data centers and how this fits into artificial intelligence. Because one of the things that we've been discussing is you want to be exposed as an investor to what is probably the most important investment theme that we've seen in our recent lifetimes with this race over artificial intelligence. But, of course, data centers feature prominently in that. The US has the largest number, I think, at around 5,000. I think there's 8,000 globally, maybe closer to 10,000 now, but the US has the largest number and highest concentration of data centers. But one of the key bottlenecks, again going back to the theme of our discussion today, is electricity and grid stability.

Doomberg:

Yeah, so we've been on this for a while. We wrote a piece last year called ""Bridge Burning,"" where we predicted that natural gas would be the bridge fuel. And then we followed that up with a piece called ""Irreconcilable Differences,"" where we made a call that we actually don't think the data centers are going to go on-grid. The existing grid is not made to grow at the pace with which AI data center demand is growing. Second, that electricity is more valuable to a data center than what the current market price is, which means prices would be going up for everybody. We're seeing that already. And so, we believe that the long-term solution is you have natural gas going into one end of the building and data coming out of the other. And maybe it's connected to the grid for backup, but we're seeing this now. So, we just wrote a piece called ""Out with the Old: Powering AI Without Crowding Out Grid Demand."" We published that on August 13th. What we're seeing now is all of these coal plants that were shut down are perfect places to build new natural gas power plants with a data center co-located on it because they have the grid connection already, so the grid can provide backup. But in reality, it's not crowding out existing demand because they're bringing on new gas turbines. So, the two projects that we profiled in that piece, both driven by EQT, the largest natural gas producer in the Marcellus Shale--a kind of pure play there, a great company run by the Rice family. The Rice family knows how to make money. They're drilling the natural gas and have signed agreements to fund a 4.4-gigawatt facility at the old Homer City coal plant--a great deal there. And then another one as well, the Shippingport Industrial Park project northwest of Pittsburgh, another 3.6 gigawatts. So, 8 gigawatts of natural gas going in, new electricity supply coming online, 85-90% of that electricity is earmarked for the data center, and the rest can dance with the grid if the grid needs a little help, or vice versa. But by and large, this is threading the needle because you can't really put much more in the way of new demand onto the existing grids without new supply. Finally, if you're running your own facilities, you tend to be able to keep the stability issue at bay because you're kind of just like, you know, we like to think of these as basically giant buildings where gas goes in and data comes out. And so, I think that's going to be the trend. EQT is pretty forward-looking. We don't own any stock, by the way. We don't invest publicly; we do invest privately. And one of the things we've been toying with is the AI market. And, boy, you want to talk about a bubble--huge amount of money flowing into the VC world. I read yesterday, again because we are participating in one of them, there are 498 AI unicorns--startups that have raised a valuation of a billion or more. And when I sent that to the founder of the company that we're involved in, his immediate reply was, ""Let's make it 499,"" to which I said, ""Yes, please, I'd be winding down Doomberg pretty quick if we do.""

Cris Sheridan:

Here at our firm, we're definitely trying to look at the ecosystem behind the AI bubble, as you called it. I mean, when you just look at the trillions of dollars that are being invested in this direction, the amount of money going into data centers, but also the amount of energy that's required to service this--these are all the different ways that you can invest around this theme. So many ways to tackle this. You don't have to just put all your money in Nvidia, of course. And I think, as you said, you know, there are some different ways that you can do that from an energy and electricity standpoint, where natural gas is playing a pivotal role.

Doomberg:

Yeah, when we invest, we always look for energy plays that are tied to volume, not price. So, we would shy away from energy producers, and we certainly wouldn't invest in the commodity directly because the long-term real price of all commodities is lower. But any company that is leveraged to volume or facilitates the release of energy volume is very interesting to us. So, service providers in the Permian, for example--if I was to do a startup, I always try to think of, like, what startup can I create out of this? Right, thinking laterally. So, any startup that has breakthrough technology that helps facilitate the produced water issue in the Permian, for example, would be very interesting to us because that is constraining production in some ways. So, royalty plays--you know, obviously, GE Vernova is flying. The stock is flying because it has a multi-year backlog of gas turbines, and it's a printing press, basically, for them. It's even outdoing their terrible wind business, which hopefully they would shut down eventually and just take a loss and write it off. And so, those are the types of things we look for: is it leveraged to volume, or does it release volume? Then that gets interesting as we close.

Cris Sheridan:

Doomberg, you are an excellent writer, as I noted, one of the most popular Substack writers. What's the best way that our listeners can follow more of your work?

“Our prime farmland should not be wasted and replaced with green new deal subsidized solar panels,” Rollins said.
A view of active, utility scale solar projects in the Midcontinent Independent System Operator, or MISO, power grid shows Iowa has fewer solar projects than surrounding states in the MISO power grid.
Rollins’ announcement also noted solar panels manufactured by “foreign adversaries” could not be used in USDA projects.
According to Clean Grid Alliance, Iowa farmers and landowners receive $4.3 million annually in land-lease payments for solar projects.","The U.S. Department of Agriculture has announced it would restrict the use of federal subsidies for solar energy projects in favor of protecting farmland, but clean energy advocates say solar gives farmers a higher production value per acre than any traditional crop.

A press release from USDA notes specific funding programs can no longer be used for wind and solar projects. The action, the release said, furthers the department’s goal to end taxpayer support of “unaffordable and unreliable ‘green’ energy sources and ensure the supply chain consists of American products and manufacturing.”

U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins said in the release the changes also will stop the loss of prime farmland to solar fields. According to the release, the number of solar panels on U.S. farmland has increased by more than 50 percent since 2012.

Rollins said beginning farmers have a more difficult time entering the agricultural market when they also have to compete with solar projects for land.

“Our prime farmland should not be wasted and replaced with green new deal subsidized solar panels,” Rollins said. “It has been disheartening to see our beautiful farmland displaced by solar projects, especially in rural areas that have strong agricultural heritage.”

Scale in Iowa

USDA defines prime farmland as land with the “best combination” of characteristics for producing food, feed, forage, fiber and oilseed crops. This land must also be available for these uses, per the definition.

According to the Clean Grid Alliance, about 17.5 million acres of Iowa’s 30 million acres of farmland are considered prime agricultural ground.

The Clean Grid Alliance analyzed data from USDA and the power grid for the central U.S. and found that if all of the proposed solar projects in Iowa were built on only prime farmland, it would occupy 0.2 percent — or about 35,000 acres — of prime farmland in the state.

The alliance report shows in 2025, Iowa had 677 megawatts of solar online, and on about 5,755 acres of land. A view of active, utility scale solar projects in the Midcontinent Independent System Operator, or MISO, power grid shows Iowa has fewer solar projects than surrounding states in the MISO power grid.

Rollins’ announcement also noted solar panels manufactured by “foreign adversaries” could not be used in USDA projects. Rollins said again in a press release Thursday that foreign-made solar panels would not be allowed in USDA projects. This separate release directed agencies to prioritize land use efficiency in power generation projects on National Forest System lands.

According to a 2022 report from the International Energy Agency, China “dominates” solar manufacturing and accounts for more than 80 percent of the share in all manufacturing stages for solar panels.

The USDA initiative would target the Business and Industry program and the Rural Energy for America Program, or REAP, both of which are under USDA Rural Development.

Per the press release, wind and solar projects are no longer eligible under the Business and Industry program.

Recipients of REAP must ensure any wind or solar installations are “right-sized for their facilities.” The release specifies that ground mount solar photovoltaic systems must be smaller than 50 kilowatts and be able to record historical energy use to remain eligible under the REAP program.

USDA did not detail how it would judge location or solar panel origin as it relates to these programs.

Clean energy advocates say the action restricts farmers’ choices

Andy Olsen, the senior policy advocate for Environmental Law & Policy Center, said in a statement that USDA’s claim to protect farmland was “dubious.”

Olsen said commercial development and data centers are “legitimate threats” to American farmland, while wind and solar projects can “coexist successfully with crops or grazing.”

Olsen argued the REAP program gave farmers and rural businesses “greater freedom” to care for their operations. The program has been used for things like rooftop solar on small businesses or on top of hog barns. Other grants have helped with energy efficiency upgrades at farms and rural businesses.

“Any conversation around protecting farmland should come from thoughtful, balanced input, not blanket restrictions that strip choices from the very people REAP was designed to serve,” Olsen said in a statement.

REAP was established in the 2008 Farm Bill, and funding for the program increased substantially under the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act.

Olsen also said solar and wind projects give farmers the ability to generate energy on their own and to create additional revenue streams.

According to Clean Grid Alliance, Iowa farmers and landowners receive $4.3 million annually in land-lease payments for solar projects.

The fact sheet from the alliance also notes solar pays significantly more per acre than traditional row crops. According to its data, solar can generate a production value of $11,068 per acre, annually, for farmers. Corn, by contrast, has a per acre production value of about $930. These figures are dependent on the price of electricity and on corn.

Some larger-scale solar projects in Iowa are managed and run by utility companies, including the 150 megawatt Wever Solar Project, operated by Alliant Energy in Lee County.

A spokesperson for Alliant said the company did not seek federal grants from USDA for any of its solar projects and is not impacted by this latest decision from USDA.",https://imengine.public.prod.cdr.navigacloud.com/?uuid=fa482997-b914-5075-b57f-67431a70ab45&type=preview&q=75&width=1200&height=800,N,,2025-08-23 10:00:12.147769

I recently had the distinct honor to join a House Natural Resources Committee Congressional delegation, or CODEL, to Japan, Taiwan, and Korea. Along with Chairman Bruce Westerman (R-Arkansas), Congresswoman Sarah Elfreth (R-Maryland), Congresswoman Celeste Maloy (R-Utah), and Congressman Nick Begich (R-Alaska), we met with allied foreign leaders and the business community to discuss a host of issues relating to our committee work and the state of Wyoming, including; forestry, energy, mining, resource development, fishing, and national parks.

South Korea is a country that has historically understood the value of free markets, sovereign decision-making, and the importance of standing strong in the face of growing threats from communist China and North Korea. These are not abstract geopolitical concerns; they are daily realities in this region. South Korea’s geographic proximity to both adversaries means our alliance is not just symbolic, but it is strategic, necessary, and mutually beneficial.

South Korea relies on imported energy to fuel its economic engine. What we heard loud and clear from our meetings is that this region is eager to increase imports of reliable, affordable American coal and liquefied natural gas (LNG). Yet, American producers, particularly those in energy-rich states like Wyoming, are hindered by misguided federal and state policies that restrict access to export markets, particularly through our West Coast ports. Until resolved, restrictive policies driven by subservience to “climate change” politics in blue states along our western shores stands in the way of Wyoming and the U.S. realizing even greater economic opportunity, one which helps our allies in the process.

Wyoming’s energy resources are among the most abundant and reliable in the world. Our coal is clean and abundant. Our natural gas is plentiful. We produce energy more responsibly and with greater regulatory transparency than any other nation on Earth. There is no reason why Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan should not be able to import our resources to meet their development and energy needs. Doing so would not only strengthen their national security but bolster the U.S. economy as well. It is a win for all involved.

In the entire Indo-Pacific region, the Chinese Communist Party continually pursues hegemonic control, and North Korea remains unpredictable under a dictator seeking global relevance. Regional security for our allies rests on a healthy defense relationship with the U.S. This is a true two-way partnership, as the U.S. receives in return an initial buffer between such regional threats and our homeland, in addition to a forward presence for our military bases to deter the CCP. In fact, we had the distinct privilege to visit U.S. troops stationed at the U.S. Naval Base Fleet Activities Yokosuka (CFAY) to discuss the nature and importance of their work and to personally thank them for their service and sacrifice. We also had the opportunity to visit the Joint Security Area at Panmunjom and take a tour of the demilitarized zone (DMZ) between South and North Korea.

I am committed to deepening these partnerships — not only for our defense and diplomatic ties, but also trade, resource development, and business-to-business collaboration. South Korea is an innovator in technology and manufacturing. Wyoming is a leader in energy and natural resource development. There is enormous potential in expanding our cooperation, and it is time we removed the roadblocks that stand in the way.

The trip we took was one of strengthening existing relationships and forging new ones. Building relationships with world political and business leaders will open even more opportunities for Wyoming’s businesses. There is an ever-growing demand for Wyoming’s reliable, affordable, and dispatchable energy resources. As we prepare for the future, the U.S. must continue to engage, to lead, and to insist on the ability to export prosperity to the world.

Faced with a perfect storm of energy insecurity, supply chain fragility, and the relentless rise of China and the U.S., the EU has launched a multi-pronged offensive to secure its future. This isn't just about survival—it's about seizing a once-in-a-generation opportunity to lead the next industrial revolution. For investors, the question isn't whether to act, but where to allocate capital to ride the wave of structural transformation.

The Clean Energy Gold Rush: Where the EU is Betting Big

The EU's Horizon Europe program has allocated €636.6 million for 2025 to accelerate climate-neutral technologies, with a laser focus on hydrogen, battery storage, and grid modernization. The Net-Zero Technologies call alone received 359 proposals for €2.4 billion, underscoring the frenzy in heavy industries like cement and chemicals. These sectors are not just “greening” their operations—they're reinventing themselves.

Take battery storage: The EU's Electric Vehicle Battery Cell Manufacturing call received 14 proposals for €1.6 billion, far exceeding its budget. Lithium-ion NMC (nickel-manganese-cobalt) technology is the holy grail here, and European startups like Northvolt and ACC (A Better Battery) are racing to scale. But the real opportunity lies in the supply chain. With the EU's Omnibus legislation slashing renewable energy permitting delays from a decade to six months, infrastructure plays in solar, wind, and grid storage are primed for explosive growth.

AI as the Secret Sauce: Digital Twins and Energy Data Spaces

The EU's latest report on AI in energy systems is a masterclass in strategic thinking. By leveraging AI to create digital twins of the European grid, the bloc is not just optimizing energy flows—it's building a real-time, decentralized network that can predict outages, manage microgrids, and even enable consumers to trade energy like stock options. This isn't science fiction; it's happening now.

The concept of “AI Factories”—dedicated hubs for training energy-specific AI models—is a game-changer. These facilities will require massive compute power, driving demand for high-performance computing infrastructure and cloud services. Companies like Atos and Siemens are already positioning themselves as key players in this space. Meanwhile, the EU's push for harmonized data standards and Model Delivery Networks (MDNs) will create a fertile ground for edge computing and AI-as-a-Service providers.

The China Factor: Strategic Partnerships in a Fractured World

While the EU is tightening its noose around AI exports to China, it's doubling down on clean energy collaboration. Chinese giants like CATL and Gotion High-Tech are building battery gigafactories in Europe, supplying critical components for the green transition. These partnerships aren't just about cost—they're about securing supply chains for rare earth minerals and critical metals.

The EU's Single Market Strategy is also opening doors for Chinese firms in renewable energy and smart manufacturing. Projects like the Pelješac Bridge in Croatia and the Hungary-Serbia Railway highlight the EU's willingness to leverage Chinese capital for infrastructure. For investors, this means opportunities in joint ventures, green bonds, and cross-border tech licensing deals.

The Geopolitical Playbook: Why the EU Can't Afford to Wait

The EU's Industrial Decarbonisation Accelerator Act (IDAA) and the CBAM simplification are more than regulatory tweaks—they're existential moves to outpace China and the U.S. in decarbonizing heavy industries. By creating lead markets for low-carbon products, the EU is forcing global competitors to raise their game.

But the clock is ticking. The U.S. Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and the EU's Green Deal Industrial Plan are creating a transatlantic race to dominate clean tech. The EU's recent $40 billion AI chip purchase from the U.S. underlines its strategic alignment with Washington, but it also highlights the need to invest in homegrown alternatives. Startups in the EU's Scaleup Europe Fund—focused on AI, hydrogen, and carbon capture—are the next Microsofts and Telsas waiting to be discovered.

The Bottom Line: Act Now or Miss the Boat

The EU's push for innovation is not a passing trend—it's a structural shift. Clean energy infrastructure, AI-driven grid management, and strategic partnerships with China in green tech are the pillars of this transformation. For investors, the key is to act decisively:

Clean Energy Infrastructure: Prioritize companies involved in battery storage, hydrogen production, and grid modernization.

AI and Digital Twins: Target firms building AI Factories, edge computing solutions, and energy data platforms.

China-EU Collaborations: Look for joint ventures in solar, EVs, and critical mineral supply chains.

The EU may be geopolitically irrelevant in some circles, but its ability to innovate and adapt is anything but. This is your moment to bet on the bloc's quiet revolution.

Jairam Ramesh has criticized the Great Nicobar mega infrastructure project, labeling it an ecological disaster being ""bulldozed"" through. He alleges that the rights of local tribal communities under the Forest Rights Act have not been settled, despite claims by the administration. The project, involving a port, airport, township, and power plant, threatens the habitat of vulnerable tribal groups.

Congress leader and former environment minister Jairam Ramesh on Saturday described the Great Nicobar mega infrastructure project as a ""maha ecological disaster"" and alleged that it is simply being ""bulldozed"" through.

He cited his earlier conversation with the Union environment minister on the issue, where he raised concerns over the project, but lamented that it has not yielded any tangible results.

He also cited media reports to say that fresh evidence suggests that rights of local tribal communities under the Forest Rights Act have not been settled.

""The Great Nicobar mega infrastructure project is without doubt a maha ecological disaster. I have had exchanges with the Union Minister of Environment and Forests on this subject but the march of folly continues.

""Now comes fresh evidence that the administration has falsely claimed that the rights of local tribal communities under the Forest Rights Act, 2006 have been identified and settled; the consent of the affected tribal communities themselves has not been lawfully obtained,"" he said in a post on X.

Live Events

""It has been abundantly clear for some time that the project is simply being bulldozed through,"" Ramesh said.

The Congress leader has been highlighting concerns over the Great Nicbar project, claiming that it is an ecological disaster and the rights of forest dwellers and tribals in the area have not been addressed.

The project, titled 'Holistic Development of Great Nicobar', involves the construction of a transhipment port, an international airport, a township and a power plant spanning more than 160 sq km. This includes around 130 sq km of pristine forest inhabited by the Nicobarese, a Scheduled Tribe (ST), and the Shompens, a Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Group (PVTG), whose population is estimated to be between 200 and 300.

Shell Monaca still enjoys a competitive advantage because its feedstock costs less than the oil-based feedstock used in China.","By Kiley Bense, Inside Climate News

In 2020, the Department of Energy predicted that Appalachia was “on the cusp of an energy and petrochemical renaissance” fueled by abundant shale gas. The agency saw the ethane cracker plant Shell was building outside Pittsburgh as “the first of what could be multiple facilities” in Ohio, West Virginia and Pennsylvania.

Five years later, Shell stands alone, the only one of a fleet of proposed projects that was actually built. Now, the company would like to sell it.

“The issue is it’s our only one, our only major facility” that makes this kind of plastic, Shell CEO Wael Sawan told analysts in a recent earnings call. “And that’s why we’ve said we’re not the natural owner of that asset.” He acknowledged that a deal may not happen quickly but said the company is having “discussions” about a sale or partnership.

For people in Beaver County who have watched the planning, construction and opening of the plant drag out over the past 13 years, that possibility—first suggested in a Wall Street Journal story in March about Shell “exploring a potential sale” of its American chemical facilities—was surprising. Marcellus Drilling News, a fracking industry trade publication, called the news a “shocker.” Residents wondered if this meant the facility, which began operating in Monaca just three years ago, could be shut down or its workforce laid off.

In a statement to Inside Climate News, Shell spokesperson Krista Edwards said the company “has not announced any sale of its Monaca facility.” Shell is “exploring strategic and partnership opportunities” for its chemical facilities in the U.S., including Monaca, she said.

Shell’s CEO said that the company wants to go “back to what we call the brilliant basics”: oil and gas, not petrochemicals. The Monaca plant—which ended up costing $14 billion to build, $8 billion more than initial estimates—is a small part of its global portfolio. Shell was enticed to build in Pennsylvania when the state government granted the company a record-breaking $1.65 billion tax break that could last 25 years.

Financial experts said Shell Monaca’s location is one reason that a sale makes sense. “Shell is about as isolated in Pennsylvania as you can get,” said Rob Stier, a global petrochemicals expert at S&P Global Commodity Insights.

“Anything that goes wrong in Pennsylvania, the Shell Pennsylvania facility has to shut down,” he said. “If it’s running, it makes money. But if it’s not running, they’re in trouble.”

What he means is that Shell loses out whenever the plant falters because it has no other way to fulfill orders. In contrast, on the Gulf Coast, the home of a massive, interconnected petrochemical hub, companies can make up for losses by producing more at another facility. “Shell doesn’t have that luxury because they have Pennsylvania as their only polyethylene manufacturing site in the world,” Stier said. Polyethylene is the type of single-use plastic produced in Monaca. Shell uses ethane, a byproduct of natural gas, to make the plastic.

As of July 2025, Shell had submitted 80 malfunction reports to the state Department of Environmental Protection, according to the nonprofit FracTracker Alliance. It paid $10 million in civil penalties for air quality violations in 2023. Residents living nearby have complained about light, noise and air pollution and say the plant is disruptive to their daily lives, with some people choosing to move away to escape it. The Shell plant has an anticipated lifespan of least 25 years.

Stier said the market for polyethylene changed in 2022, the same year the Pennsylvania facility came online. Responding to increased demand for plastics domestically, China built more petrochemical plants. But in the last few years, demand there hasn’t kept up with all the new production, and the country is over capacity. That means fewer opportunities for American companies to sell in China, and it creates more competition for Shell in the U.S. market.

Shell Monaca still enjoys a competitive advantage because its feedstock costs less than the oil-based feedstock used in China.

“This is a valuable asset,” said Stier. The site is also likely to retain the huge tax subsidies it received from the state, even with a new owner, according to financial experts.

Jessica Caldwell, head of insights at Edmunds.com, expressed concern over consumer awareness of the impending tax credit deadline, noting that increased interest in EVs hasn’t matched her expectations.
As the fall approaches, there is potential for a wave of disappointment among consumers who may not realize the significance of the tax credit and its expiration.","As the deadline for the federal electric vehicle (EV) tax credit approaches, car buyers are racing against the clock to take advantage of the incentives before they expire on September 30. The tax credit, which offers up to $7,500 for qualifying electric vehicle purchases, was set to be eliminated under the recent One Big Beautiful Bill Act. However, new guidance from the IRS has introduced some flexibility to the deadline.

Buyers now have the option to secure a tax credit as long as they enter into a binding contract for the vehicle before the cut-off date, even if the delivery occurs later. The IRS clarified that a partial payment, such as a nominal down payment or trade-in, is also required to meet eligibility criteria. Although the tax credit won’t be granted until the buyer takes possession of the car, the binding contract condition could significantly ease concerns for shoppers trying to navigate the tight timeline.

Traditionally, the IRS has relied on delivery dates to determine eligibility for the tax credit. For instance, if a vehicle qualified for a credit in one year but not in the following, customers who took delivery on January 1 would miss out on the incentive. However, this recent guidance reflects a shift in approach. Sean Tucker, lead editor at Kelley Blue Book, remarked that this is not entirely new for the IRS, noting that similar language was employed when the rules for claiming the credit adjusted post-Inflation Reduction Act.

This flexibility is expected to benefit those buying vehicles that need to be shipped from another state or custom-ordered vehicles not yet in production. Andy Phillips, vice president of the Tax Institute at H&R Block, emphasized the importance of this added leeway, stating that it could make a significant difference for buyers already aware of which vehicles they want.

Understanding the implications of the federal EV tax credit can be complex, especially given its evolving nature. Unlike typical tax credits, the EV credit can now be applied as an upfront discount at the point of sale. To qualify, new vehicles must adhere to specific price caps and manufacturing criteria, including certain percentages of battery minerals sourced from North America and allied countries. Additionally, buyer eligibility is income-restricted, with limits set at $150,000 adjusted gross income for individuals and $300,000 for married couples.

Several well-known EV models, including offerings from Tesla, Chevrolet, Hyundai, and Kia, are on the list of vehicles qualifying for this credit. Prospective buyers are advised to confirm with dealers that the specific vehicle in question is eligible, as not all model variants meet the necessary criteria. A separate used vehicle credit allows buyers of EVs over two years old to benefit from up to $4,000, provided the selling price is under $25,000. There is also an advantageous leasing option without restrictions, which has led to mixed reactions among critics and enthusiasts alike.

Despite rapid growth in the EV market between 2020 and 2023, recent months have shown stagnation, with electric vehicles holding steady at approximately 10% market share in the U.S. This plateau has raised concerns among automakers and environmental advocates. With the current administration’s move to roll back various policies promoting EV adoption, including the elimination of tax credits, analysts anticipate an initial surge in EV sales as consumers rush to meet the deadline. Notably, data from Cox Automotive indicates that new EV sales rose nearly 20% year-over-year in July, with used EV sales climbing 40%.

However, many industry experts remain cautious about long-term trends. Jessica Caldwell, head of insights at Edmunds.com, expressed concern over consumer awareness of the impending tax credit deadline, noting that increased interest in EVs hasn’t matched her expectations.

Read more about the methodology to estimate for offshore wind jobs.","Working people in coastal areas and industrial heartlands are set to benefit from better workforce protection and skilled job opportunities in Britain’s mission to secure clean, homegrown energy.

A Fair Work Charter has been set out in proposals published today (Saturday 23 August) – working with Unions and business – that will require offshore wind developers to pay into a skills fund or spend a minimum amount on skills training in their local communities to support oil and gas workers, apprentices or school leavers move into the UK’s growing offshore wind industry.

Skills training could be provided through education schemes, training facilities, new equipment or work experience and internships, creating new opportunities for working people and unlocking growth across Britain.

Proposals also encourage developers and supply chain firms to create more high-quality, secure jobs in offshore wind, with better access to trade unions and stronger protections on pay and terms and conditions. This could include a commitment to a ‘Fair Worker Charter’ co-developed between industry and trade unions.

As we reach our clean power mission by 2030, offshore wind is estimated to support up to 100,000 jobs, with many jobs outside of London in coastal and rural parts of the country. Industry estimates a typical salary for an offshore wind worker is £10,000 higher than the UK average, with 90% of the UK’s oil and gas workforce having skills that are transferrable into offshore renewables.

These changes will help ensure these jobs are always skilled, secure and well-paid as more of these jobs become available on the clean energy transition providing long-term stability and job opportunities.

Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said:

Britain’s clean energy future will be powered by secure, unionised jobs for local people right across the country – from East Anglia to Teesside and Aberdeen.

We’re backing businesses that invest in working people in these communities, securing a route to long-term careers for oil and gas workers, apprentices and school leavers, as we deliver our Plan for Change.

Christina McAnea, General Secretary at UNISON, said:

Clean, homegrown energy is vital to Britain’s future growth and to tackling climate change. A highly skilled, fairly paid and secure clean energy workforce is essential to achieving these goals.

UNISON has long argued that the government needs to invest in retraining existing energy workers so their skills and experience can be transferred to clean energy jobs. Investment in apprenticeships and opportunities for young people is crucial in building the workforce of tomorrow.

This initiative offers a chance to boost skills across the energy sector, create and protect well-paid jobs, and support the renewal of coastal communities and industrial regions. Working together under a Fair Work Charter – unions, government and business – can deliver growth and stronger protection for workers.

Eddie Dempsey, General Secretary at RMT, said:

We welcome the commitments to make trade union recognition and strong pro-worker standards a part of offshore wind contracts, covering re-training, protecting pay, and working conditions.

This ensures that oil and gas workers are not being left behind.

Alongside the Employment Rights Bill and wider pledges to strengthen offshore workers’ rights, including for seafarers in the supply chain, the progress so far shows a plan is coming together.

That will give our members confidence that their livelihoods will be protected through these turbulent times.

Sue Ferns OBE, Senior Deputy General Secretary at Prospect, said:

Transitioning to a clean energy future will mean tens of thousands of new jobs being created across the UK, and it is welcome to see a clear commitment from the government that these should be good quality, unionised jobs.

Training the clean energy workforce of tomorrow is one of the biggest challenges we face, and it is only fair that renewables developers that rely on this labour contribute to skills programmes.

While progress has been made on unionisation in renewables, there is still more to do, and Prospect has been calling for the strongest possible signal from government that they expect companies receiving public money or participating in public procurement processes to work with and recognise trade unions.

This comes ahead of the UK’s first ever Clean Energy Workforce Strategy, which will ensure that clean energy jobs are not only widely available, but also high-quality. Offshore wind will be the backbone of Britain’s future energy needs, offering skilled jobs on good wages, and the opportunity to build a varied and fulfilling career.

Offshore wind requires skilled workers across the country in areas such as blade repair, mechanics, wind turbine maintenance, marine spatial planning and health and safety protocols.

But in some parts of the sector workers and trade unions have called for more consistency around workplace standards and trade union access to support these roles. Today’s proposals would ensure the industry is always delivering for its workforce by encouraging them to work in partnership with trade unions to develop stable, long-term jobs.

The measures would be introduced through the Clean Industry Bonus, which provides offshore wind developers with funding on the condition that they build new factories in deprived regions or invest in more sustainable supply chains to drive economic growth.

The consultation will also seek views on the introduction of onshore wind into the Clean Industry Bonus to help turbocharge its deployment in the UK after years of stagnation due to the de-facto ban under the previous government. This follows the government’s launch of the first ever onshore wind strategy earlier this year, and will get the country building again, as the sector is estimated to support up to 45,000 jobs in Great Britain by 2030.

Notes to editors

Earlier this year, the government allocated up to £544 million (2025 prices) through the scheme for offshore wind and partnered with Great British Energy - the UK’s publicly owned clean power company - alongside industry and The Crown Estate, to invest £1 billion in offshore wind supply chains.

These reforms will be included in the government’s flagship renewables auction in 2026, known as Contracts for Difference Allocation Round 8 subject to consultation.

Brazil's ag sector wants to flip climate script

Sao Paulo, 22 August (Argus) — Agriculture and land-use produce the largest share of Brazil's greenhouse gas emissions, but the sector is trying to show it plans to clean up its act ahead of the UN Cop 30 summit there later this year. Emissions from agriculture and land-use, which ag contributing the most to the latter, accounted for 74pc of all Brazilian greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in 2023, according to the latest data from GHG emissions monitoring platform SEEG. The agribusiness sector alone was responsible for over 97pc of all deforested area in the last six years in Brazil, according to land monitoring system MapBiomas. The sector will send observers to Cop 30 to promote its investments to adapt to and mitigate global warming, Brazil's agribusiness confederation CNA executive director Muni Lourenco said. Federal initiatives have pushed agribusiness into the climate action package as part of Brazil's strategy to both reduce climate change and support economic development, which Cop 30's executive director Ana Toni has said she will fight for during the summit. ""Agribusiness can also be part of the climate solution,"" climate and society institute ICS director Maria Netto said during a climate conference recently. Brazil's Caminho Verde program aims at increasing productivity in the agribusiness sector through reforestation and recovering already deforested but unproductive land for planting. Agriculture occupies 280mn hectares in Brazil, of which 165mn are used as pastures and 82mn of those hectares are not considered productive. The program's goal is to recover 40mn lower-producing hectares by 2035, converting them to higher-producing areas without deforesting new lands. Other climate solutions stemming from agricultural practices are Brazil's mandatory biofuel mixes , which recently increased to 30pc of ethanol in gasoline and 15pc of biodiesel in diesel, and clean energy generation from agriculture waste such as sugarcane waste and manure. The biofuels that often come from agricultural feedstock count toward avoided emissions — the reduction that comes from burning this substitute for fossil fuel — but this does not help solve the agriculture industry's emissions problem. Still, the agricultural sector's presence in Brazil's climate action plan mainly stems from Brazil's government putting its foot down so it can try to comply with its nationally determined contribution (NDC). The NDC seeks to cut emissions by 59-67pc from 2005 levels by 2035, equivalent to 850mn-1.05bn tons of CO2 equivalent. The Brazilian NDC also aims at achieving zero liquid emissions — when emissions and carbon capture offset each other — by 2050 through low-carbon agriculture and cattle raising practices and reforestation, among other goals. This works to address the climate impact of its largest economic driver while not alienating the sector . Balancing act Yet agriculture's legislative efforts often clash with executive wishes to strengthen Brazil's climate-friendly image. Earlier in August, Lula partially vetoed a new environmental licensing bill, eliminating most of the items supported by the agricultural sector and coalition of lawmakers from rural states. The final text maintained a special licensing model that fast-tracks primarily agriculture ventures, but blocked the proposals to create a self-licensing procedure for small agriculture projects. Brazilian environment minister Marina Silva had also criticized the original bill because it could block trade deals — such as the EU-Mercosur — that rely on complying to climate pledges. Brazil's business interests will continue to argue that developing countries cannot be held to the same standards as much higher-polluting developed economies. The impact of each country's climate and environment are also key, groups such as CNA say. ""Brazil cannot be put under temperate [climate] standards when it operates under tropical circumstances,"" Lourenco added.

US exempts small refiners from biofuel quotas: Update

Updates throughout New York, 22 August (Argus) — The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) today fully or partially granted the majority of small refiners' requests for waivers from federal biofuel blend mandates, while limiting the windfall for newly exempt refiners. The agency fully accepted 63 petitions, offered 50pc relief in response to 77 petitions, denied 28 requests, and determined that 7 were ineligible. Program data shows 13 petitions still pending, mostly from the 2025 compliance year. The Renewable Fuel Standard requires oil refiners and importers to blend biofuels into the conventional fuel supply or buy Renewable Identification Number (RIN) credits from those that do. Refiners that process no more than 75,000 b/d can request hardship exemptions from the mandates, which they have long cast as financially onerous. President Donald Trump's administration had an unprecedented backlog of requests to decide after courts took issue with former president Joe Biden's reasoning for mass denials. While the number of exemptions frustrated biofuel and farm advocates, small refiners that lobbied officials for retroactive compensation were denied more sweeping relief. EPA said on Friday that it would return already-surrendered RINs to newly exempt companies but that only credits from 2023 and later could be used for future compliance. Returned older credits, effectively worthless, ""are not expected to impact demand for biofuels"", the agency said. Because the older credits have no value, EPA does not plan to force oil companies to blend more biofuels to account for those exemptions. But EPA signaled a different approach for more recent years, saying that it planned to account for actual exemptions in 2023 and 2024 and expected exemptions in 2025 when setting future biofuel quotas. The agency said it would ""in the near future"" submit a proposal to the White House Office of Management and Budget that will clarify its plan. EPA had already signaled that it would estimate future exemptions when setting biofuel mandates, but accounting for actual exemptions from active compliance years in addition would be a major shift that could increase costs for larger oil companies, if implemented. Program data show that affected small refiners have to submit about 1.4bn fewer RINs across 2023 and 2024 following Friday's exemptions — but companies without exemptions could have to make up that lost volume in the future depending on EPA's pending proposal. The total mandates in those years were 20.9bn RINs and 21.5bn RINs respectively. EPA said Friday it aimed to ensure stability in the often-volatile RIN market, noting that replacing expired credits with active ones would have flooded the market with 3bn more RINs. Current-year D6 ethanol credits rose 4pc and D4 biomass-based diesel credits rose 3pc on Friday, as traders saw EPA's solution to older-vintage credits as limiting supply increases. Biofuel groups, while frustrated that most eligible refiners won at least some relief, expressed cautious optimism about EPA's plan. Renewable Fuels Association president Geoff Cooper said Friday's exemptions ""should have little or no effect on current and future levels of renewable fuel production and use"". But companies will eagerly await more details about EPA's proposal to account for 2023 and 2024 waivers, which could come as soon as next week. EPA has signaled that it wants to finalize new biofuel mandates before November, but that timeline appears ambitious if the agency has to first take comment on a proposal that could drastically shift its formula for setting those mandates. Clean Fuels Alliance America, which represents biomass-based diesel producers, said that the new plan ""will delay the finalization of the 2026 and 2027 rule"". In a draft regulation earlier this year, EPA proposed record-high biofuel blending for those years. Court fights await Legal challenges are virtually guaranteed. The agency said that its decisions had ""nationwide scope or effect"" — an effort to steer litigation toward one federal circuit court rather than a hodgepodge of regional courts that might issue conflicting rulings. Small refiners denied full relief are likely to challenge the Trump administration's reasoning. EPA said it almost entirely relied on recommendations from the Department of Energy (DOE), which scores individual applications for ""disproportionate economic hardship"" and considers factors like a refiner's output of diesel compared to gasoline and its local market's acceptance of renewables. While EPA is legally required to consult with DOE, the new policy of largely deferring to that department's recommendations would be a major change from recent years. A 2022 study from the US Government Accountability Office concluded that DOE's methodology was ""critically flawed"", and EPA officials at the time told the watchdog agency that DOE's analysis no longer provided useful information. Accepting DOE scores appears to have led to some counterintuitive results, though specific details from applications are kept confidential. Par Pacific's 18,000 b/d Wyoming refinery earned full exemptions for three straight years before losing relief the next. Ergon's 23,000 b/d facility in West Virginia won partial exemptions for 2021 and 2024, but not the years in between. And EPA offered at least some relief to Suncor's 36,000 b/d Commerce City East refinery over six straight years — while denying any relief for four of those years to Suncor's 67,000 b/d Commerce City West refinery at the same Colorado site. ""Not a lot of rhyme or reason to it"", a refining source told Argus . The unpredictability of the exemptions — with essentially all refiners receiving different answers depending on the year — could also make it hard for EPA to estimate future waivers when finalizing biofuel quotas. The agency has received some exemption petitions for 2025 but has yet to decide any for that year or beyond. Large oil refiners will also hotly oppose any effort from EPA to raise their biofuel blending to compensate for their smaller competitors winning exemptions. While some oil companies joined with farm groups this year to push for higher biofuel mandates, the industry has more recently expressed frustration with Trump-backed biofuel policies that they say are boosting feedstock and fuel costs. ""It is inexplicable that EPA is even considering adding more mandated biofuels on top of the largest and most expensive [Renewable Fuel Standard] mandate ever proposed by reallocating exempted volumes"", the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers said.

Brazil updates Cop 30 forest fund plan

Sao Paulo, 22 August (Argus) — Brazil has advanced its Tropical Forest Forever Facility (TFFF) initiative, a fund to preserve global tropical forests that will be launched at the UN Cop 30 summit, adding new governance and financing structures. Under the updated plan, TFFF will act through two distinct entities: the Tropical Forest Investment Fund (TFIF), a legally independent investment vehicle, and TFFF itself, hosted initially by the World Bank. The TFIF will blend sponsor capital — 20pc from sovereign and philanthropic sources and 80pc raised via bond issuance to institutional investors. Returns from this portfolio will fund annual payments to participating countries, starting at $4/ha of preserved forest. Payments are subject to an inflation adjustment, capped at 2pc/yr. It aims to raise $25bn in sponsor capital and an additional $100bn in senior market debt. TFIF will ""exclude investments that cause significant environmental impact"", such as those in activities related coal, peat, oil and natural gas. The updated plan also adds that funded countries must maintain deforestation rates below 0.5pc and will face steep payment discounts for forest loss or degradation. Each hectare (ha) deforested could reduce payments by up to 200ha worth of funding, depending on severity. It also includes a canopy coverage threshold of 20–30pc within specific mapping for countries to apply to the fund. That threshold is subject to updated degradation and deforestation discount ratios. It also highlights that TFFF will not generate or issue carbon or biodiversity credits, nor will it replace other existing forest finance initiatives such as REDD+. Instead, it is ""designed to complement, not duplicate, existing programs"". Finally, the TFFF has reduced its repayment term to 30 years — adding a 10-year grace period — and will require that at least 20pc of payments be allocated to indigenous peoples and local communities. Brazil plans to launch TFFF during Cop 30, which it will host in November in northern Para state. Deforestation is one of Brazil's flagship issues for the summit. The TFFF working group expects to conclude the details of the fund's financial model by September. It then expects initial pledges from sponsor countries to begin after the World Bank board's meeting from 13-18 October. The Amazon Cooperation Treaty Organization countries — Brazil, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, Peru, Suriname and Venezuela — will sign a joint declaration in favor of TFFF on Friday, Brazil's government said. Brazil is working to eliminate deforestation — both legal and illegal — by 2030, to meet its emissions reductions targets under the Paris climate agreement.

Incentive to book German Rehden gas storage decreases

London, 22 August (Argus) — The financial incentive to book capacity at the largest German gas storage site Rehden for the remainder of this storage year continues to decrease. Available injection capacity at Sefe's Rehden storage site in combination with maintenance in October have rendered bookings at the storage site unattractive, with a worse outlook each day that passes without additional bookings. Sefe has offered a doubled injection rate of 1.75 GWh/d since 16 July from 882 MWh/d in previous auctions. As of today, the firm had only sold 13.96TWh of capacity out of 44.68TWh of technical capacity. As a result of the increased injection rate on offer, Sefe can only sell 24.6TWh or 55pc of the site's technical capacity. The boosted injection rate did contribute to further bookings at first, but has not done so in recent auctions. It would take 64 days to completely fill a bundle, and given maintenance on 6-24 October at the storage site, if firms were to book capacity today and inject at the increased firm injection rate from Saturday, it would only fill the bundle by 8 November. Factoring in injection days in each month, the average THE spread to the first-quarter 2026 contract at the last close would be -€1.35/MWh. Market participants have indicated that a €1.80-2/MWh spread is needed for them to profitably book and make use of Rehden space. And every day that capacity is not booked brings the required injection period further into November, reducing the incentive. The THE November first-quarter 2026 spread is narrower than that of earlier months, closing at -€0.305/MWh at the last close, much tighter than the THE balance-of-August first-quarter 2026 spread of -€1.87/MWh. But if Sefe were to offer additional injection capacity, this would improve the incentive to book space at the site. Sefe could offer 3.11 GWh/d of injection capacity — which would further reduce the storage capacity it can offer — and still fill the site to 45pc of capacity, in line with Germany's national storage law. This would allow firms to fill a bundle in 36 days, before the start of October maintenance. If a firm were to book capacity today and inject at this rate from Saturday, it would fill the storage space by 28 September. Considering these injection days, the THE spread to the first-quarter 2026 contract at the last close would be -€1.81/MWh, bringing it within the profitable margin. Other storage sites currently more attractive Storage capacity at other storage sites in Germany is currently more attractive to book than at Rehden, when only considering injection rates. Space at the Etzel ESE (Uniper Energy Storage), Epe-L (RWE), Nuttermoor H-5 (EWE), Jemgum H (EWE) and Nuttermoor H-4 (EWE) storage sites is currently more attractive to book than Rehden based on their firm injection rates ( see table ). All these storage sites, where a total of 7.32TWh of capacity is available, currently offer higher firm injection rates per GWh of capacity than Rehden. This does not take into account additional or interruptible injection capacity that might be on offer at the sites. That said, EWE was unable to sell any capacity at Nuttermoor H-4 in an auction on Thursday, the firm told Argus today. The firm had offered 1.36TWh of gas for the remainder of the storage year.

I. Background

Section 129 of the Clean Air Act (CAA or the Act) directs the Administrator to develop regulations under that section and section 111(d) of the Act to limit emissions of nine air pollutants (particulate matter, carbon monoxide, dioxins/furans, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, hydrogen chloride, lead, mercury, and cadmium) from four categories of solid waste incineration units: municipal solid waste incinerators; hospital, medical, and infectious solid waste incinerators; commercial and industrial solid waste incinerators; and other solid waste incinerators.

On December 1, 2000, the EPA promulgated new source performance standards (NSPS) and EG to reduce air pollution from CISWI units, which are codified at 40 CFR part 60, subparts CCCC and DDDD, respectively. See65 FR 75338. The EPA revised the NSPS and EG for CISWI units on March 21, 2011. See76 FR 15704. Following promulgation of the 2011 CISWI rule, the EPA received petitions requesting that it reconsider numerous provisions in the rule. The EPA granted reconsideration on certain issues and, subsequently, on February 7, 2013, it promulgated a CISWI reconsideration rule. See78 FR 9112. Subsequently, the EPA received petitions to reconsider certain provisions of the NSPS and EG for CISWI units. On January 21, 2015, the EPA granted reconsideration on four specific issues and subsequently, on June 23, 2016, it finalized reconsideration of the CISWI NSPS and EG. See81 FR 40956.

Following promulgation of the June 23, 2016, final action, the EPA received requests from industry stakeholders and implementing agencies to clarify various issues with implementation of the standards. In addition, the EPA identified certain procedural issues, including testing and monitoring issues and inconsistencies within the rules, that required further clarification or correction. To address the issues, the EPA proposed amendments on June 15, 2018, to several provisions of the 2016 CISWI NSPS and EG. See83 FR 28068. On April 16, 2019, the EPA finalized technical amendments to the June 15, 2018, proposal by promulgating clarifying changes and corrections to the 2016 CISWI rule. See84 FR 15846.[ ]

Section 129(b)(2) of the CAA requires states to submit to the EPA for approval state plans and revisions that implement and enforce the EG—in this case, 40 CFR part 60, subpart DDDD. State plans and revisions must be at least as protective as the EG and become federally enforceable upon approval by the EPA. The procedures for submittal and adoption of state plans and revisions are codified in 40 CFR part 60, subpart B.

On May 31, 2017, Florida submitted a state plan to implement and enforce the EG for existing CISWI units in the State, and submitted supplements on December 19, 2017, and February 2, 2018.[ ] In a notice of proposed rulemaking published on June 4, 2018 (83 FR 25633), the EPA proposed to approve Florida's State plan. Additional information concerning Florida's State plan submission and the rationale for the EPA's actions for this final rule are explained in the June 4, 2018, proposed rulemaking. Comments on the proposed rulemaking were due on or before July 2, 2018. The EPA received one comment on the proposed action that is not relevant. The comment is included in the docket to this action.

II. Final Action

The EPA is finalizing approval of Florida's section 129 State plan for CISWI units in the State, as submitted on May 31, 2017, and supplemented on December 19, 2017, and February 2, 2018. The State plan was submitted in full compliance with the requirements of sections 111(d) and 129 of the CAA, and 40 CFR part 60, subparts B and DDDD.[ ] This approval is based on the rationale provided in the NPRM associated with this rulemaking. The EPA's approval is in accordance with the general provisions of plan approval found in 40 CFR part 60, subpart B and 40 CFR part 62, subpart A, and is pursuant to the Agency's role under 42 U.S.C. 7411(d) and 7429(b). The EPA's approval of Florida's State plan is limited to those CISWI units that meet the criteria established in 40 CFR part 60, subpart DDDD, and grants the State authority to implement and enforce the performance standards and source requirements of the EG, except in those cases where authorities are specifically reserved for the EPA Administrator or his designee. Authorities retained by the EPA Administrator are those listed in 40 CFR 60.2542.

III. Incorporation by Reference

In accordance with requirements of 1 CFR 51.5, the EPA is finalizing regulatory text that includes incorporation by reference of Florida Administrative Code (FAC) Chapter 62-204.800(9)(f), Commercial and Industrial Solid Waste Incineration (CISWI) Units, which became effective in the State of Florida on December 21, 2017. This incorporation establishes emission standards and compliance times for the control of air pollutants from certain CISWI units that commenced construction on or before June 4, 2010, or commenced modification or reconstruction after June 4, 2010, but no later than August 7, 2013. FAC Chapter 62-204.800(9)(f), Commercial and Industrial Solid Waste Incineration (CISWI) Units, provides details regarding Florida's adoption of the applicability provisions, compliance times, emission guidelines, operational standards, test methods, compliance provisions, monitoring requirements, reporting guidelines, recordkeeping guidelines, and definitions contained in the EPA's emission guidelines for ( printed page 41305) existing CISWI units (40 CFR part 60, subpart DDDD). The emissions standards and compliance times established within the Florida State plan are at least as stringent as those required by the EG for existing CISWI units subject to Subpart DDDD. The EPA has made, and will continue to make, these materials generally available through the docket for this action, EPA-R04-OAR-2018-0184, at https://www.regulations.gov and at the EPA Region 4 Office (please contact the person identified in the For Further Information Contact section of this preamble for more information). This incorporation by reference has been approved by the Office of the Federal Register as of September 24, 2025, and the plan is federally enforceable under the CAA as of the effective date of this final rulemaking.

IV. Statutory and Executive Order Reviews

Under the CAA, the Administrator is required to approve a 111(d)/129 plan submission that complies with the provisions of the CAA and applicable Federal regulations. In reviewing 111(d)/129 plan submissions, the EPA's role is to approve State choices, provided they meet the criteria of the CAA and the EPA's implementing regulations. Accordingly, this action merely approves State law as meeting Federal requirements and does not impose additional requirements beyond those imposed by State law. For that reason, this action:

Is not a “significant regulatory action” subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget underExecutive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993);

Is not subject toExecutive Order 14192 (90 FR 9065, February 6, 2025) because state plan approval actions are exempt from review under Executive Order 12866;

Does not impose an information collection burden under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.);

Is certified as not having a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.);

Does not contain any unfunded mandate or significantly or uniquely affect small governments, as described in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (Pub. L. 104-4);

Does not have federalism implications as specified inExecutive Order 13132 (64 FR 43255, August 10, 1999);

Is not subject toExecutive Order 13045 (62 FR 19885, April 23, 1997) because it approves a state program;

Is not a significant regulatory action subject toExecutive Order 13211 (66 FR 28355, May 22, 2001); and

Is not subject to requirements of section 12(d) of the National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act of 1995 (15 U.S.C. 272 note) because application of those requirements would be inconsistent with the CAA.

In addition, the Florida State plan for existing CISWI units is not approved to apply on any Indian reservation land or in any other area where the EPA or an Indian Tribe has demonstrated that a Tribe has jurisdiction. In those areas of Indian country, the rule does not have Tribal implications and will not impose substantial direct costs on Tribal governments or preempt Tribal law as specified by Executive Order 13175 (65 FR 67249, November 9, 2000).

This action is subject to the Congressional Review Act (CRA), and the EPA will submit a rule report to each House of the Congress and to the Comptroller General of the United States. This action is not a “major rule” as defined by 5 U.S.C. 804(2).

Under section 307(b)(1) of the CAA, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by October 24, 2025. Filing a petition for reconsideration by the Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this action for the purposes of judicial review nor does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed and shall not postpone the effectiveness of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements ( see section 307(b)(2)).

This credit also extends to used EVs, where a $4,000 tax incentive is currently offered, according to Chase Auto Finance.
Amanda notes that leasing an EV can be especially advantageous, as the tax credits are often applied directly to monthly payments.
The monthly payment for the 2024 Prologue AWD EX was $239 with a $3,199 down payment, whereas the 2025 version requires a staggering $599 monthly payment and a $4,299 down payment.
Bloomberg echoed Amanda’s sentiments, advising consumers that leasing an electric vehicle before tax incentives are stripped away could be a savvy financial move.","As electric vehicle (EV) sales continue to gain momentum in the United States, a new wave of advice is emerging for potential buyers: don’t hesitate to negotiate. In a recent video, TikTok user Amanda (@themanidiway) underscores the importance of haggling, especially in light of the impending cessation of the $7,500 Federal EV Tax Credit slated for September 30, 2025. This credit also extends to used EVs, where a $4,000 tax incentive is currently offered, according to Chase Auto Finance.

Amanda argues that the impending expiration of these credits could lead to significant price increases for electric vehicles, making them “extremely unaffordable” for many drivers. She suggests that this shift may trigger a broader transformation in consumer behavior, leading dealerships to reduce their EV inventories as they brace for a drop in demand. With the lucrative credits still in play, dealerships might currently be more inclined to sell EVs at a loss just to clear out their stock.

The interplay between these incentives and leasing options also offers a tantalizing glimpse into potential EV deals for consumers. Amanda notes that leasing an EV can be especially advantageous, as the tax credits are often applied directly to monthly payments. This structure has generated remarkable leasing opportunities, such as a unique deal in Colorado where drivers could lease a Fiat 500e with no down payment and no monthly payments, provided they meet certain credit criteria.

Other vehicles are also attracting attention, albeit with less irresistible offers. For instance, the Honda Prologue, while already a popular choice, has seen its leasing costs more than double from 2024 to 2025. The monthly payment for the 2024 Prologue AWD EX was $239 with a $3,199 down payment, whereas the 2025 version requires a staggering $599 monthly payment and a $4,299 down payment.

Bloomberg echoed Amanda’s sentiments, advising consumers that leasing an electric vehicle before tax incentives are stripped away could be a savvy financial move. The outlet highlights several appealing lease options. For example, the Mercedes-Benz EQB, priced at around $53,000, can be leased for roughly $352 per month, while Hyundai’s 2025 Ioniq 6 is available for $169 a month with a $4,000 down payment over a 24-month term.

For those leaning toward ownership, Amanda suggests exploring lease-to-own agreements, which could potentially allow drivers to negotiate a favorable buyout price after the lease term—especially crucial when federal tax incentives are no longer available. Amanda encourages buyers to leverage their knowledge of the upcoming incentive changes during negotiations, stating that it worked to her advantage in her own experience, leading her to secure a $22,000 discount on her new Audi A6 e-tron premium plus, which she enjoys “very much.”

With the market shifting and incentives fading, it appears that consumers who actively engage in negotiating could benefit significantly as they navigate the evolving landscape of electric vehicle purchases.",https://news.ssbcrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Tips-for-Haggling-on-Electric-Vehicles-Before-EV-Tax-Credits.jpg,N,,2025-08-23 04:58:45.125105

Conclusion: A Contrarian Bet on Resilience Enphase Energy is not a short-term play.","In the ever-shifting landscape of renewable energy, few companies have navigated the crosscurrents of policy uncertainty, trade wars, and market volatility as deftly as Enphase Energy (ENPH). As the U.S. and global solar markets grapple with the dual forces of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and escalating tariffs, Enphase's strategic positioning—rooted in innovation, operational discipline, and geographic diversification—offers a compelling case for value investors. But can this solar microinverter and energy storage leader rebound in a sector defined by turbulence? Let's dissect the numbers, the strategy, and the risks.

Strong Earnings and Operational Efficiency: A Foundation for Resilience

Enphase's Q2 2025 results underscore its ability to thrive amid headwinds. Revenue of $363.2 million, slightly above expectations, reflects a 2% sequential increase, driven by U.S. and European demand. The company's non-GAAP gross margin of 48.6%—bolstered by IRA tax incentives—掩饰 a more modest 37.2% margin when excluding policy benefits. While tariffs have eroded margins by ~2 percentage points, Enphase's pivot to U.S. manufacturing (shipping 1.41 million microinverters and 46.9 MWh of IQ Batteries domestically) has mitigated exposure to global supply chain shocks.

Operational efficiency is another pillar of strength. Non-GAAP operating expenses fell to $77.8 million in Q2, down from $79.4 million in Q1, while non-GAAP operating income rose to $98.6 million. The company's cash reserves of $1.53 billion and disciplined capital spending ($8.2 million in Q2, down from $14.6 million in Q1) further highlight its financial prudence. Share repurchases of $30 million in Q2 also signal confidence in its intrinsic value.

Strategic Positioning: Navigating Policy and Tariff Risks

Enphase's alignment with the IRA is a double-edged sword. The $50 million safe harbor agreement with a major TPO financier ensures access to tax credits for domestically produced IQ8HC™ Microinverters, shielding it from the 145% tariffs on Chinese battery imports. However, the looming expiration of Section 25D tax credits by 2027 could disrupt the U.S. residential solar market, pushing demand toward TPO models—a segment where Enphase currently holds a weaker market share.

Geographically, Enphase is diversifying its risk. European revenue grew 11% sequentially in Q2, driven by the IQ Battery with FlexPhase in Spain and Germany, and the launch of the IQ Balcony Solar Kit for urban dwellers. This expansion into high-growth markets offsets U.S. headwinds and positions Enphase to capitalize on the EU's green energy transition.

Product Innovation: A Long-Term Growth Engine

Enphase's product pipeline is a testament to its R&D prowess. The fourth-generation Energy System, including the IQ Battery 10C and IQ Meter Collar, addresses key pain points for residential users: energy density, installation efficiency, and grid integration. The Solargraf platform's AI-driven design tools and TPO integrations further streamline operations for installers, enhancing customer retention.

Critically, Enphase is building an ecosystem. By integrating microinverters, batteries, and EV charging solutions, it's positioning itself as a one-stop shop in a fragmented market. This holistic approach not only differentiates Enphase but also creates switching costs for customers, a rare advantage in a sector prone to commoditization.

Market Reaction and Near-Term Risks

Despite these strengths, ENPH's stock has underperformed in 2025, down 12% year-to-date. The Q2 earnings report, which exceeded revenue and EPS expectations, was met with a 3% post-earnings decline, reflecting investor skepticism about near-term visibility. Q3 guidance of $330–370 million in revenue, while conservative, falls below Wall Street's consensus, raising concerns about margin compression from tariffs and the phasing out of IRA benefits.

The company also faces rising competition from Chinese manufacturers and U.S. rivals scaling domestic production. Additionally, the potential shift to TPO models could pressure Enphase's margins if it fails to secure a larger share of the leasing market.

Weighing the Investment Case

For value investors, Enphase presents a paradox: a company with strong fundamentals and a visionary product roadmap, yet burdened by near-term policy risks and sector-wide volatility. The key question is whether its long-term growth potential in solar and energy storage justifies the current discount.

Risks to Consider:

- Policy Uncertainty: The expiration of Section 25D and potential changes to IRA incentives could disrupt U.S. demand.

- Tariff Pressures: Rising import duties may squeeze margins unless U.S. manufacturing scales further.

- Competition: Chinese and U.S. rivals are accelerating innovation and cost reductions.

Catalysts for Growth:

- IRA-Driven Domestic Production: Tax credits and 45X incentives will sustain U.S. manufacturing margins.

- Product Leadership: The IQ Battery 10C and Solargraf platform position Enphase to capture premium pricing.

- Global Expansion: Europe's energy transition and emerging markets offer untapped demand.

Conclusion: A Contrarian Bet on Resilience

Enphase Energy is not a short-term play. Its stock price volatility reflects the sector's turbulence, but its strategic alignment with policy tailwinds, operational discipline, and product innovation suggest a durable long-term story.

According to The New York Times, the Inflation Reduction Act was the biggest climate bill in U.S. history. By the end of 2025, though, many of its tax credits will be eliminated.

Upgrading your home and taking advantage of these credits sooner rather than later could mean saving thousands of dollars.

Shoppers who act fast can still make eco-friendly updates and save because many of the clean appliance rebates from the IRA are still available. One of the most attractive rebates to take advantage of is the induction stove tax credit.

The size of the credit is based on household income. Low-income households could get 100% of their costs covered after installing an induction range, but savings can be significant across the board.

""Moderate-income households (essentially everyone else who is eligible for the rebates) could get up to 50% of their costs covered,"" the Times explained. Eligible households can save up to $840 on an Energy Star-approved induction cooktop or range.

Unlike gas stoves, induction burners do not emit harmful pollutants indoors. So, switching to an induction stove is an easy, affordable way to improve indoor air quality.

Gas ranges have been linked to increased respiratory problems such as asthma, according to research published in the Annals of the American Thoracic Society.

Induction stoves aren't just better for air quality, though. They're also more practical and user-friendly, as they cook food faster, conserve energy, and are easier to clean.

Induction converts say they save time and energy in the kitchen, which is a win for consumers and the environment. Reducing household energy consumption helps decrease the amount of harmful heat-trapping gases entering the atmosphere.

For renters or those who want to test drive induction burners, there are options for switching to induction.

Plug-in induction burners are a great way to try induction without a kitchen renovation or committing to a new stove.

But the new documentary The Nuclear Future argues nuclear is the solution to this country’s rapidly expanding energy needs – demands fueled in part by the sudden expansion of AI, which requires tremendous amounts of electricity for data centers. The film, premiering September 15 at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, DC, is directed by award-winning filmmaker Evan Mascagni (Building a Bridge, Circle of Poison) and narrated by actor Boyd Holbrook (Narcos, Logan). After the Kennedy Center premiere, the documentary will go on a nine-state tour of 14 college campuses, “where cutting-edge research is underway and future scientists and engineers are currently studying.”

Watch the trailer for The Nuclear Future below.

“The film follows young advocates and business leaders as they advocate for the expansion of nuclear power in America, where energy demand is surging due to factors including the construction of AI data centers,” notes a synopsis. “The added demand has raised questions about the reliability of America’s existing electric grid to support such increases. The advocates must overcome the power source’s controversial past, as they tackle policy and financial challenges to unlock its transformative potential as a clean baseload energy source.

“The Nuclear Frontier offers a rare, behind-the-scenes look at how industry, technology and policy are converging to shape America’s next energy chapter, particularly as the country competes against China for leadership in nuclear’s zero-carbon technology. The United States has built just two nuclear reactors in the past 30 years, while China has built 37 in just 10 years and has another 30 under construction.”

According to a release, the documentary was filmed at locations including Diablo Canyon Power Plant in California, the University of South Carolina, and Washington DC “that help tell the story of the movement toward more nuclear power.”

Director Evan Mascagni is a convert to the pro-nuclear cause.

“For years, I was opposed to nuclear energy, but I couldn’t fully explain why,” the filmmaker said in a statement. “After I was approached to make this film and began to seriously explore the issues, my perspective changed. I came to realize that embracing nuclear energy, along with wind and solar, may be one of the most effective ways to give my daughter and her generation a real chance at inheriting a planet that hasn’t been devastated by climate change.”

In 2020, the Department of Energy predicted that Appalachia was “on the cusp of an energy and petrochemical renaissance” fueled by abundant shale gas. The agency saw the ethane cracker plant Shell was building outside Pittsburgh as “the first of what could be multiple facilities” in Ohio, West Virginia, and Pennsylvania.

Five years later, Shell stands alone, the only one of a fleet of proposed projects that was actually built. Now, the company would like to sell it.

“The issue is it’s our only one, our only major facility” that makes this kind of plastic, Shell CEO Wael Sawan told analysts in a recent earnings call. “And that’s why we’ve said we’re not the natural owner of that asset.” He acknowledged that a deal may not happen quickly but said the company is having “discussions” about a sale or partnership.

For people in Beaver County who have watched the planning, construction, and opening of the plant drag out over the past 13 years, that possibility — first suggested in a Wall Street Journal story in March about Shell “exploring a potential sale” of its American chemical facilities — was surprising. Marcellus Drilling News, a fracking industry trade publication, called the news a “shocker.” Residents wondered if this meant the facility, which began operating in Monaca just three years ago, could be shut down or its workforce laid off.

In a statement to Inside Climate News, Shell spokesperson Krista Edwards said the company “has not announced any sale of its Monaca facility.” Shell is “exploring strategic and partnership opportunities” for its chemical facilities in the U.S., including Monaca, she said.

Shell’s CEO said that the company wants to go “back to what we call the brilliant basics”: oil and gas, not petrochemicals. The Monaca plant — which ended up costing $14 billion to build, $8 billion more than initial estimates — is a small part of its global portfolio. Shell was enticed to build in Pennsylvania when the state government granted the company a record-breaking $1.65 billion tax break that could last 25 years.

Financial experts said Shell Monaca’s location is one reason that a sale makes sense. “Shell is about as isolated in Pennsylvania as you can get,” said Rob Stier, a global petrochemicals expert at S&P Global Commodity Insights.

“Anything that goes wrong in Pennsylvania, the Shell Pennsylvania facility has to shut down,” he said. “If it’s running, it makes money. But if it’s not running, they’re in trouble.”

What he means is that Shell loses out whenever the plant falters because it has no other way to fulfill orders. In contrast, on the Gulf Coast, the home of a massive, interconnected petrochemical hub, companies can make up for losses by producing more at another facility.

“Shell doesn’t have that luxury because they have Pennsylvania as their only polyethylene manufacturing site in the world,” Stier said. Polyethylene is the type of single-use plastic produced in Monaca. Shell uses ethane, a byproduct of natural gas, to make the plastic.

As of July 2025, Shell had submitted 80 malfunction reports to the state Department of Environmental Protection, according to the nonprofit FracTracker Alliance. It paid $10 million in civil penalties for air quality violations in 2023. Residents living nearby have complained about light, noise, and air pollution and say the plant is disruptive to their daily lives, with some people choosing to move away to escape it. The Shell plant has an anticipated lifespan of at least 25 years.

Stier said the market for polyethylene changed in 2022, the same year the Pennsylvania facility came online. Responding to increased demand for plastics domestically, China built more petrochemical plants. But in the last few years, demand there hasn’t kept up with all the new production, and the country is over capacity. That means fewer opportunities for American companies to sell in China, and it creates more competition for Shell in the U.S. market.

Shell Monaca still enjoys a competitive advantage because its feedstock costs less than the oil-based feedstock used in China.

“This is a valuable asset,” said Stier. The site is also likely to retain the huge tax subsidies it received from the state, even with a new owner, according to financial experts.

Shell’s tax ‘windfall’ in Pennsylvania

Shell’s tax breaks from the state are behind its decision to push forward with the project even as other companies walked away from the “renaissance” for economic reasons, said Anne Keller, managing director at Midstream Energy Group, an energy consultancy. Keller has worked in the energy and petrochemical industry for more than 30 years. Compared to Ohio and West Virginia, Pennsylvania “far and away shelled out more money,” she said.

In 2016, then-vice president of Shell’s Appalachia Petrochemicals Division, Ate Visser, acknowledged the role the subsidies played in its decision-making. “I can tell you, hand to my heart, that without the fiscal incentives, we would not have taken this investment decision,” he said.

Those incentives help to explain how Shell ended up stranded in a region that turned out not to make sense for petrochemical buildout in the current market.

Keller said Pennsylvania’s gift to Shell is unprecedented in the industry. “I’ve literally never heard of anything like that. It was just stunning,” she said. “The state got dealt.”

While there was some greater economic advantage to the region during construction, when more than 9,000 workers were needed, once the plant became operational and the workforce shrank to 500, “the state might as well have just put people in an office and written them a check,” Keller said. Essentially, she said, the financial benefit to the company is so large that the state is effectively off-setting the cost of all full-time employees at Monaca with the tax break.

Edwards, the company spokesperson, said Shell currently employs about 500 people in Monaca and “regularly averages” approximately 400 contractors at the site. Four hundred is the minimum number of permanent jobs required by the state’s tax agreement with Shell.

In 2012, the year the state legislature passed the $1.65 billion tax credit, Republican Gov. Tom Corbett’s industry and labor secretary, Julia Hearthway, said she was convinced that the Shell plant would “kickstart a chemical manufacturing boom.”

“And with it comes jobs. Not a few hun­dred jobs. Not one com­pany hir­ing 300 or 400 jobs. But thou­sands and thou­sands of jobs to Pennsylvania,” she told StateImpact Pennsylvania.

At one point, the Corbett administration claimed the Shell plant would spawn 20,000 permanent jobs directly and indirectly, because it would draw so many people to move to Beaver County. The administration said Shell would build its plant in another state if Pennsylvania didn’t offer enough incentives.

That same year, the Pennsylvania Budget and Policy Center called the tax breaks “a windfall” for Shell and said the deal was expensive for taxpayers while creating few permanent jobs. That warning now appears prescient.

The economic boom and thousands of new jobs that were supposed to follow in Shell’s wake have failed to materialize, according to research conducted by the Ohio River Valley Institute.

“There was a lot of happy talk about how, once you build petrochemical facilities in Appalachia, then all these other businesses will relocate next to them, which is not a thing that happens and hasn’t happened,” said Eric de Place, a research fellow at ORVI who has studied Shell Monaca. De Place’s analysis found that Beaver County’s population has declined since 2012, and it has not seen growth in jobs, GDP, or businesses.

“There’s simply no way to look at economic performance and say, ‘Beaver County got this petrochemical plant and it flourished.’ In fact, it is declining relative to the U.S. and Pennsylvania, and it has not outperformed the counties around it,” he said. “I think you look at the scoreboard and you say, this was a terrible investment of taxpayer money.”

Stier said of Shell’s change of course, “The real driver of this is corporate strategy. Fifteen years ago, Shell was going in a different direction.

“It just goes to show you how big global companies can change their strategies pretty quickly. Companies can make some big, multibillion-dollar mistakes at times, and market conditions change,” Stier said. For Shell, “this asset no longer fits.”",https://www.spotlightpa.org/imgproxy/insecure/rt:fill/w:1200/h:900/g:sm/el:1/q:75/MjAyNS8wOC8wMW1hLWhlMXQtemEzMC1zbjMzLmpwZWc=.jpeg,N,,2025-08-23 11:01:22.205354

Just like the capital project, the upgrades in question would have no additional tax impact on Forestville’s school taxes.

The district is pursuing a Clean Green Energy Project through the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) to install HVAC systems and mechanical upgrades throughout the district. The project, totaling $7,466,977, would be entirely covered by state aid, grants and NYSERDA funding.

The project would be funded by a NYSERDA grant of $945,377 and $100,000 in utility rebates, with the remaining cost of over $6.4 million to be offset by New York State Building Aid.

Superintendent Dr. John O’Connor initially spoke on the matter in January. “We thought it was too good to be true,” O’Connor said at the time. In the months since, Forestville felt comfortable with the project’s scope and funding opportunities in order to proceed.

The only downside for the district is that in order for the work to be covered at no tax impact, voters would need to approve the project — the second substantial building project in less than two years.

The project will be up for a public vote Thursday, Oct. 16 from 1 until 8 p.m. in the Middle/High School lobby. Absentee ballots are available at the District Clerk’s office. Military ballot applications must be received by the District Clerk by 5 p.m. Sept. 22.

While the work would be covered by grants and state aid, it would still first need to be borrowed by the district. The total cost of the project combined with the previously approved Capital Project now surpasses $19 million, but it would still not require a tax increase. Voters approved the Capital Project by a vote of 128-31. Since then, the district approved a school tax levy increase of 2.3% this year, after no tax increase in back-to-back years. The increase of 2.3% was the most the district could request without exceeding the tax cap.

The already-approved Capital Project includes various maintenance upgrades both inside and out of multiple District facilities. The improvements include a repair of the cafeteria’s outside wall; a front entrance renovation at the Elementary School to mitigate flooding concerns; brick repointing at each of the District’s main buildings to address water damage; locker room upgrades at both buildings; and an upgrade to the Middle/High School Weight Room to provide access for the community after school hours.

Many other areas were also targeted as part of the initial planning phase of the proposal, including a major heating and cooling system, but it was deemed too cost-prohibitive for the District to pursue with all of the other needs. The additions through the Clean Green Energy Project would address many of those needs.

As part of the proposed Clean Green Energy Project, the district would install new rooftop units at both schools to address heating, air conditioning, and air quality in classrooms, cafeterias, music rooms, and gymnasiums. The project would also replace windows on the second and third floors of the Middle/High School to reduce energy loss. Electrical upgrades will improve efficiency, as well.

Addressing heating and cooling systems in schools is a more prevalent concern than ever now that the Heat Mitigation in Public Schools legislation takes effect Sept. 1. The law requires districts to adhere to statewide guidelines for temperatures in classrooms and other district spaces. The proposed upgrades to the district’s facilities would address such concerns.

“This is a tremendous opportunity for our district to modernize our buildings, meet environmental standards, and enhance learning environments — all without placing a burden on local taxpayers. I encourage all residents to participate in the vote and help us shape a healthier future for the Forestville school community,” O’Connor said.

Technologies like pyrolysis, microwave-assisted catalysis, and photocatalysis convert plastic into high-purity CNTs and hydrogen, enhancing recycling’s economic and environmental appeal. For instance, pyrolysis can process diverse plastics, while microwave-initiated catalysis yields significantly more hydrogen than traditional methods using advanced bimetallic catalysts. Researchers have also devised processes to tackle hard-to-recycle plastics by converting them into syngas and then CNTs. Photocatalysis uses sunlight and semiconductors to break down plastics into hydrogen and useful organics. While these technologies show promise for creating a circular plastic economy, widespread adoption depends on cost-effective catalysts, renewable energy integration, and supportive policies. If scaled successfully, plastic waste could shift from a global liability to a resource for sustainable innovation.

A proposed GST recast in India, aiming to boost the small car market by lowering taxes on ICE vehicles, could inadvertently hinder the growth of the electric car sector. With reduced price advantages, EVs, particularly small models, may face increased competition, potentially slowing their adoption despite current high growth and government targets for EV sales by 2030.

The Indian electric vehicle (EV) sector, particularly the small car and hatchback segment, may soon face a speed bump. The proposed goods and services tax (GST) recast could boost the small passenger car market. Small cars are likely to be placed in the 18% tax slab, substantially reducing the tax burden on them, as per a recent ET report based on information from sources. Small cars of 4 metres and less in length and engine capacity up to 1,200 cc (petrol, CNG and LPG) now attract 28% GST and 1% cess. Large cars and SUVs are likely to face the special rate of 40%, sources told ET. Currently, these vehicles attract 43-50% tax, which includes GST and cess. There will likely be no change in the GST rate for electric vehicles (EV), currently at 5%, the sources said.

The tax recast, if it indeed results in such major cuts in taxes on small cars and hatchbacks, can have an unintended impact. Electric cars, particularly small ones and hatchbacks, will lose a substantial edge over ICE (internal combustion engine) cars.

A recent report by HSBC Investment Research says EV manufacturers might face a competitive setback with such a tax recast. While ICE vehicles will get a boost with lower prices, it would also undercut the price advantage of EVs, potentially slowing their adoption in India.

India’s GST framework is a key policy tool in shaping consumer choices in the automotive sector. The current GST rate for small ICE cars is 28%, with additional cess in some cases, while EVs enjoy a much lower GST of just 5%, a policy crafted to promote clean mobility and reduce oil dependence and urban pollution. This tax differential has been one of the major demand drivers for EVs in India, especially in the cost-sensitive small car segment. A reduction in GST for ICE cars, particularly in the entry-level category, will alter the total cost of ownership equation and potentially reverse some of the recent gains made by electric hatchback models.

India's electric cars are on a high growth path

Live Events

Though India has made big strides in the EV sector, its electric cars are still at a nascent stage. Electric passenger vehicle retail sales jumped 93 % year-on-year in July, led by Tata Motors, as per the Federation of Automobile Dealers Associations (FADA). Total electric passenger vehicle registrations rose to 15,528 units last month as compared with 8,037 units in the year-ago period, it said. However, these sales are dominated by vehicles other than cars. EV growth in India has been led by two and three-wheelers that accounted for 86% of the over six million EVs sold last year. Sales of four-wheel passenger EVs made up only 2.5% of all car sales in India last year, but they have been surging, jumping to more than 110,000 in 2024 from just 1,841 in 2019.

India aims to achieve a 30% share of electric vehicles in total vehicle sales by 2030. As per the Aayog, with 18.78 million EV sales in 2024 or just 7.6% of total vehicle sales, the country needs to accelerate significantly to meet its 2030 targeting which will require an increase of over 22% in the next five years. The overall EV sales bump will of course help electric cars too especially when so many attractive, in terms of looks, efficiency and price, have started flooding the market.

The share of electric vehicles in new car sales expanded at a rapid pace in the first five months of this calendar year, as new products from automakers such as Tata Motors, Mahindra & Mahindra, MG Motor and Hyundai boosted sales that had slowed down the previous year. EVs accounted for 3.7% in the January-May period, compared with 2.2% in 2023, show industry data. Automotive industry insiders have told ET the launch of new EV models with longer range and enhanced features, expansion of charging infrastructure and a reduction in price differential with fossil fuel-powered vehicles have boosted demand for electric vehicles in India.

Customers now have more vehicles to choose from; as many as 16 EV models are currently available to purchase, compared with 10 in 2023. While several of the new vehicles travel a longer distance than the older models on a single charge, the number of charging stations has more than doubled to 26,311 from 12,146 in the same period, as per Bureau of Energy Efficiency data, reducing range anxiety. Industry executives predict the growth to pick up in coming years.

Will the GST recast slow down electric cars?

Though electric cars are on a high growth path, the challenges still remain formidable. The share of electric vehicles in overall car sales has inched up in the last six months, but customers are opting for them largely as second or third vehicles limiting widespread adoption in the local market, a top executive at the country’s largest carmaker Maruti Suzuki has said. Partho Banerjee, senior executive officer, marketing and sales, Maruti Suzuki, said, “The share of electric cars in total sales of passenger vehicles increased to 4.5% (in July) from about 2.5% last year. But the base is still small. Customers are mostly buying EVs as second or third cars, not as the first one. It is a chicken-and-egg situation, till the time an adequate public charging network is in place, customers are unlikely to use electric cars as a primary vehicle.” Low utilisation of public charging stations, on the other hand, makes it difficult for operators to invest in further expansion.

While Maruti Suzuki is focusing on setting up charging networks to smoother intra-city commute for customers, Korean rival Hyundai has announced plans to beef up the number of charging stations on major highways to make hassle-free inter-city travel for EV owners.

However, despite efforts to boost electric car adoption, the segment is still at a nascent stage. A tax roadbump can stymie its pace of growth.

Electric car manufacturers may find it hard to enjoy as much price premium as their vehicles currently command. Entry-level car segment is extremely price-elastic. A 5% to 8% swing in final pricing can tilt purchasing decisions significantly especially when entry-level buyers are more conscious about limitations of electric cars. Also, many entry-level EVs compromise on range, features or performance compared to their ICE counterparts. If price parity narrows, consumers may lean towards more familiar ICE models. Despite lower running costs, the higher upfront cost of EVs has remained a barrier for mass adoption. A smaller tax differential might reduce the financial incentive for choosing an electric car.

While the possible GST cut on ICE small cars will be very much beneficial for mass consumers as well as the broader automotive industry when India needs to spur consumption as well as economic growth, it might undercut the nascent electric car industry as an unintended consequence.

Yet, at a time when India is building an ecosystem of battery manufacturing, charging infrastructure and supply chain localisation, and competition hardens between electric car makers, EV policy incentives are likely to phase out or stagnate because a developed EV landscape will result in better economic and price efficiencies. However, the possible tax differential resulting from the GST recast might impact growth in the immediate future as the HSBC report points out.

But my advocacy came at a high cost — in 2008, NAE fired me after an interview where I called for climate change action and expressed support for civil unions.
I continue to speak about the need to combat climate change because the cost of denialism is much too high.","Denialism — when people deny the existence or validity of a provable truth — is not just alive and well in the nation, it is a daily occurrence.

Think about how government officials deny the accuracy of labor statistics, the reality that tariffs are taxes on Americans, the safety of vaccines and the benefits of water fluoridation.

And let’s not forget the dishonesty about the Epstein files, which in effect, is a denial of the sexual trafficking of hundreds of girls and young women, some as young as 14. There is “truth decay,” as the nonprofit public policy group the RAND Corporation calls it.

Denialism of climate change is now official federal policy, and already, the first steps pose an existential threat to the nation — and the world as we know it. The Department of Energy in July released a report, “A Critical Review of Impacts of Greenhouse Gas Emissions on the U.S. Climate,” written by five scientists known for their denial of climate change.

This specious report came the same day the Environmental Protection Agency announced a proposal to overturn a key 2009 legal ruling giving the federal government authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles, power plants and other sources. Without this essential legal underpinning, the Trump administration will be able to roll back or repeal 31 key environmental rules advancing clean air, clean water and climate change mitigation almost overnight.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin proclaimed that this proposal would “amount to the largest deregulatory action in the history of the United States.”

This glib statement is good news for the oil industry executives to whom Trump promised a windfall in exchange for $1 billion in industry contributions to his campaign, but for the rest of the country, it is dire news.

Without environmental regulations, air and water pollution will increase, climate change will accelerate and there will be more devastating fires, floods, deadly heat waves, hurricanes and other extreme weather events. This will result in more foodborne diseases; respiratory illnesses, cancers and other serious health problems; burned-out or flooded communities; higher insurance costs; billions spent on disaster relief and thousands of preventable deaths.

As the son of a fruit farmer growing up in Quincy, I experienced in a deeply personal way the links between climate, energy and the economy. Farmers can attest to the impact of climate on their crops and their livelihoods. The looming reality of climate change should be of concern to everyone.

For me, fighting climate change is more than a passion, it is a religious calling.

As vice president of the National Association of Evangelicals in the early 2000s, I spoke out often and loudly about the need for Creation Care, gave a sermon at the National Cathedral on Earth Day, taught at Christian colleges and churches, authored articles, lobbied Congress and even appeared in documentaries.

But my advocacy came at a high cost — in 2008, NAE fired me after an interview where I called for climate change action and expressed support for civil unions.

Yes, I reeled from being fired, but NAE’s action did not defeat me. I continue to speak about the need to combat climate change because the cost of denialism is much too high.

George Orwell said, “However much you deny the truth, the truth goes on existing, as it were, behind your back.”

The truth behind our backs is that climate change is undeniable, it is happening right now and ending environmental protections will only make things worse — and fast.

There is another important truth: “We the people” can do something to preserve our environment. The administration must seek and review public comments on its proposals. The EPA has extended the public comment period to Sept. 22 for its proposal to repeal the 2009 greenhouse gas endangerment finding. (Instructions for commenting are at st.news/rule).

Don’t sit on the sidelines. Speak out, submit comments, contact your congressional representative or send a letter to the president.

This is a fight worth winning — for all of us.",https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/08202025_tzr_tzr_215656.jpg?d=1200x630,N,,2025-08-23 14:03:23.429617

“Revolution Wind is already employing hundreds of local union workers supporting both on and offshore construction activities.
Ørsted’s US offshore wind projects have totaled approximately 4 million labor union hours to date, 2 million of which are with Revolution Wind,” they continued.
Revolution Wind is the third project halted by the Trump administration this year.
In April, the Interior Department also halted the Empire 1 Wind project off the coast of Long Island, N.Y.","The Trump administration on Friday issued an order stopping all activities of a wind energy project in Rhode Island that could have supplied electricity to 350,000 homes.

The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) in a letter sent to Ørsted, the Danish company operating the project, said the stop work order seeks “to address concerns related to the protection of national security interests of the United States and prevention of interference with reasonable uses of the exclusive economic zone, the high seas, and the territorial seas.”

“You may not resume activities until BOEM informs you that BOEM has completed its necessary review,” the letter added.

The Revolution Wind Project, a $1.5 billion plan, approved under former President Biden is 80 percent complete and projected to be finished by 2026, according to Ørsted. The company says it’s “fully permitted, having secured all required federal and state permits.”

Friday’s order is the latest move by the Trump administration to dismantle wind and solar projects. Congress passed the One Big Beautiful Bill, which heavily limits incentives for renewable energy enacted in Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act.

On top of that, the Interior Department announced last month that it would conduct strict review processes for all wind and solar projects. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum’s office said this would include decisions on grants, environmental impact and land leases.

This week, the administration also launched a national security probe into imports of wind turbines. Why wind turbine imports are considered a national security problem remains unclear. However, the administration requested comments from the public about the impact of foreign government subsidies, among other topics.

“Ørsted is investing into American energy generation, grid upgrades, port infrastructure, and a supply chain, including U.S. shipbuilding and manufacturing extending to more than 40 states,” the company said in a statement.

“Revolution Wind is already employing hundreds of local union workers supporting both on and offshore construction activities. Ørsted’s US offshore wind projects have totaled approximately 4 million labor union hours to date, 2 million of which are with Revolution Wind,” they continued.

The project was approved in 2023 and had a 20-year power purchase agreement. When fully built, the project could have provided electricity to hundreds of thousands of homes in Rhode Island and Connecticut. In May, the Attorney General of Connecticut, William Tong, and 17 other AGs sued the administration over its attempts to restrict wind projects.

“Ørsted is evaluating the potential financial implications of this development, considering a range of scenarios, including legal proceedings,” the company said on Friday.

The Interior Department did not immediately respond to The Hill’s requests for comment.

Ørsted has another wind project in Rhode Island, named South Fork, which was approved in 2021 and also part of the Biden administration’s aim to start the clean energy transition.

Revolution Wind is the third project halted by the Trump administration this year. In early August, the Interior Department reversed Biden’s approval for the Lava Ridge Wind Project in Idaho, which could have supplied 500,000 homes with electricity.

“Gargantuan, unreliable, intermittent energy projects hold America back from achieving U.S. Energy Dominance while weighing heavily on the American taxpayer and environment,” Burgum said in the press release early August.

In April, the Interior Department also halted the Empire 1 Wind project off the coast of Long Island, N.Y.

1. Why Can’t the U.S. Build 5-Minute E.V. Chargers? — The New York Times

China is dominating the EV market with 70% of global manufacturing in 2024. Two major Chinese EV companies have already announced a 5-minute charger.

However, car buyers in the US aren’t likely to get access to 5-minute chargers anytime soon. China has already pulled a generation or two ahead on the technology, and very few Chinese-branded cars are sold in the US because of tariffs. China treats EV charging stations as critical infrastructure, much like the US does highway maintenance. They build charging hubs directly into the grid, unlike the US.

China invested upfront in its charging network, before there was a market. They saw it coming, now they’ve pulled ahead and left others behind.

2. Will Oil Demand Peak Soon? Trump Administration Doesn’t Want to Hear It. — The New York Times

The latest International Energy Agency, or IEA, forecasts have shown oil and gas demand could peak by the end of this decade as EV sales grow, and the cost of solar and storage plummets. The projected peak in demand is partly because China’s appetite for oil is leveling off as they shift from oil to battery-powered transportation. BloombergNEF and oil companies like BP and Equinor have also projected a peak in oil use by around 2030.

Others, like Exxon Mobil and OPEC, believe oil will see continued growth in the coming decades.

ERCOT says electricity usage may rise 62% in 2030 from its current record. Data centers, crypto-mining facilities and factories are planned to be built in Texas, and renewables are slated to provide the power. 94% of new power capacity added to the Texas grid since 2020 has come from renewables or batteries. Texas has more clean energy and batteries than any other state, supplying more than 30% of its electricity.

The “One Big Beautiful Bill” ends tax credits for these types of projects starting in 2028, making them more expensive to build. Texas officials have tried to encourage construction of natural gas plants, but cost uncertainties and a global turbine shortage have made it a challenge. The state’s booming economy is at stake if it can’t add more electricity generation.

Solar panels that plug into regular wall outlets have been popular in Europe for years, and are now gaining traction in the U.S. The systems are about the size of a door, and can be mounted on the balcony of an apartment or in a backyard. This is especially appealing right now considering rooftop solar tax credits are set to expire, and some homeowners can’t afford the upfront cost of rooftop solar. One plug-in solar customer saw $35 savings per month on their electricity bill. The smaller systems allow people to better manage where their energy comes from and what they pay.

I know this, you know this and Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe certainly knows it too.
In a recent interview with InsideEVs, Scaringe shared that the brand is not only on-track to delivering hands-free driving on both city streets and highways, with point-to-point driving available in 2026.
But we've said is in 2026 we'll be hands-free point-to-point.
In fact, a recent study confirmed that hands-free driving is now the most in-demand feature in new cars.","Rivian says it plans to have hands-free point-to-point driver assistance available in late 2026.

This will eventually lead to the brand's roll-out of an eyes-off, truly autonomous system at a later date.

CEO RJ Scaringe believes that autonomy will be an unintentional driver of electric cars.

Let’s be honest, half the folks out there with driver-assistance systems out there probably aren’t treating them like they should be anyway. They’re texting or sneaking in some Tiktoks while peeling back the wrapper on a Taco Bell burrito. I know this, you know this and Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe certainly knows it too. That’s one of the reasons that the brand is so hell-bent on getting that whole pesky autonomy thing figured out

It turns out that Rivian is on the “precipice” to introducing a more mature hands-free driving system in its trucks, and it’s coming a lot sooner than you think. In a recent interview with InsideEVs, Scaringe shared that the brand is not only on-track to delivering hands-free driving on both city streets and highways, with point-to-point driving available in 2026. But Scaringe believes the company will eventually deliver point-to-point eyes-off autonomy as well.

""We're at the precipice of starting to see the delivery of capabilities that map to all this infrastructure that we built. First was hands-free. The obvious next step is hands-free everywhere. Then the next step is the vehicle can drive itself point-to-point, you know, address to address,"" said RJ during the interview. He acknowledged that the timeline could be a bit dicey, though:

""It's hard to be overly precise on [a timeline], honestly. You can see why you can you can get the dates wrong on this. But we've said is in 2026 we'll be hands-free point-to-point. We're going to show some of this at our autonomy day. Then we'll increasingly start to allow eyes off.""

The point that RJ is trying to make is that self-driving is at this awkward phase in its lifecycle. Automakers see the value in bringing self-driving into the forefront of the modern car, but actually achieving autonomy is a hard task that has equated to a giant cash burn for most brands out there today (as many automakers very well know).

You can’t actually buy a self-driving car today. In industry terms, cars are technically still Level 2, meaning you’re supposed to be paying attention to what’s going on around you because the car isn’t driving—you are. But everyone is treating it like it’s Level 3 anyway and they’re free to sneak a peek away from the road to answer a text.

Photo by: Rivian

Rivian’s pitch here is to cut out the charade. Let the car actually do the driving and stop pretending that the meat sack behind the wheel is paying attention.

""One of the unspoken things about self-driving systems—especially in personally-owned vehicles—most systems are level two, meaning you, as the driver, are supposed to be attentive to the road and paying attention as a redundant layer but not actually driving the vehicle,” said RJ. “The way that this is often measured is your hand on the wheel or your eyes on the road. So what happens is, as we well know, you put your hand on the wheel, but you're still texting. This is very, very common. And so it's just a workaround to treat your level two as if it's a level three.""

It’s not just a convenience thing either. Ask Tesla, GM or any other automaker out there, and they’ll tell you that the industry is trending towards personal autonomy being the next big thing. In fact, a recent study confirmed that hands-free driving is now the most in-demand feature in new cars.

That makes the road to personal autonomy one driven by business and not just another tech bro looking to prove that their company can be the first one to do it.

RJ says that he believes Tesla’s head start in autonomy is one of the reasons that it was able to gain so much traction for its vehicles so quickly. He also credits the tech for driving demand not just for Tesla, but for EVs in general, and believes that the consumer push for the tech will push forward EVs as a whole by the end of the decade.

""I do think that as we get to the end of this decade, like as we get to like 2030-2031, the ability to have hands off, eyes off in most situations is going to become very valuable and will start to drive a lot of purchase decisions,"" said RJ. ""I think it could help accelerate—by coincidence—electrification because I think this is most likely to be seen on electric vehicles.

Long-term, it’s clear that autonomy is a sales hook for every automaker out there. If you’re not with it, you’re going to get left behind.

“The United States continues to face an energy emergency, with some regions experiencing more capacity constraints than others,” Wright said in extending the order. “With electricity demand increasing, we must put an end to the dangerous energy subtraction policies embraced by politicians for too long.”

The power system is under unprecedented stress from the digital economy, as it tries to keep up with demand for cloud computing and artificial intelligence data centers — and prepare for voracious demand growth through 2030.

In a second order directing Consumers Energy and the Midwest grid operator to keep the J.H. Campbell coal-fired power plant in West Olive, Michigan, running through November, Wright deployed a nearly century-old law written for wartime use. Wright extended his original order in May that kept the plant open.

“The emergency conditions that led to the issuance of the original order persist,” Wright said.

But in hewing to Trump’s personalized understanding of the grid’s challenges, Wright risks ignoring the full range of stresses ahead, say electricity experts, issues that can’t be solved just by keeping old power plants running.

Wright again Thursday pointed an accusing finger at wind and solar power.

“This order will help ensure millions of Americans can continue to access affordable, reliable, and secure baseload power regardless of whether the wind is blowing or the sun is shining,” Wright said.

Grids serving Texas and huge swaths of the middle of the country use significant amounts of renewable energy to keep the lights on, with utilities and big technology companies building or purchasing more. California has installed large amounts of energy storage to enable its supply of renewable power.

The decisive action to keep the J.H. Campbell plant running contrasts dramatically with the snail-paced regulatory changes that have guided an industry that abhors surprises.

“Everything we do in the energy space takes too long — 10 years or more,” said Jeff Weiss, executive director of Distributed Sun, a solar energy developer, speaking at a U.S. Energy Association event this week. “We need to figure out how to do everything in two years,” he added, “and it’s critical to our economy.”

Yet whether an imminent emergency exists that would justify federal intervention into electricity markets is widely disputed — and pinned mostly on the Trump administration’s political calculations.

There is no imminent shortage of electricity, Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel (D) declared in a lawsuit challenging the original DOE order keeping the J.H. Campbell plant running.

The attorney general’s challenge to the DOE order cited the authority of states to oversee power generation and utility rates. The Michigan Public Service Commission and the region’s grid operator, the Midcontinent Independent System Operator, both agreed to the closure.

The Trump energy policy

The executive order and lawsuit thrust the Midwest grid’s reliability challenges into a politically charged confrontation.

The foundation of Trump’s energy policy seems to boil down to four assertions: Power grids can only meet Big Tech’s artificial intelligence ambitions if they rely heavily on fossil fuels. Electrifying a limitless number of data centers is a matter of national security. Wind and solar power aren’t reliable sources of electricity. And lastly, U.S. policy should reflect the president’s hostility toward non-nuclear clean energy sources that benefited from former President Joe Biden’s climate policy.

“Energy dominance,” in Trump’s first year, translates to more natural gas, new nuclear reactors built sometime in the 2030s — and whatever existing coal plants the administration can keep from closing today.

Wright cited his department’s grid reliability study in July warning that power outages across the U.S. could increase by 100 times in 2030 “if the U.S. continues to take reliable power offline” — and just as the tech industry’s need for electricity spirals upward. DOE’s worst-case scenario holds that 104,000 megawatts of older coal and gas plants nationwide could retire by 2030, creating a supply crisis.

But that threat analysis assumes that data centers will require more than 50,000 megawatts of new generating capacity, most of it running around the clock for months at a time as it processes enormous AI workloads.

That figures are guesswork, at best, grid experts say. And companies operating in the power markets won’t build if they can’t count on a guaranteed, long-term electricity supply.

“No credible data center developer is going to break ground on a large data center without confidence in 24/7 electricity,” says John Moura, director of reliability assessment and performance analysis for the North American Electric Reliability Corp. (NERC).

How much to build?

The demands for more power keep coming.

“There’s a lot of uncertainty,” said Tom Falcone, president of the Large Public Power Council. “We know that there’s a lot to build. How much exactly?”

Developers’ requests to hook new power plants into grid systems have choked interconnection queues. “Is it all needed?” Falcone asked.

States and utilities are pressing for longer-term financial commitments from data centers and others requesting a lot of electricity. “That is the balancing act when you’re in a large build-out,” Falcone said.

Further, clean energy advocates say that the administration’s eagerness to single out the risks of wind and solar generation during severe weather misses another critical point. The DOE grid emergency analysis uses historical weather patterns to estimate power needs during periods of stress. But in line with Trump’s views, DOE chose not to examine the severity and frequency of extreme weather as climate change worsens over time — threatening natural gas infrastructure and other conventional sources of power.

NERC’s most recent grid reliability assessment does consider the future, examining which hours of the year extreme cold or heat would put the grid at greatest stress. Those risk factors also apply to natural gas, the largest source of electricity generation.

NERC Chief Executive Jim Robb told a FERC conference in June that grid operators need “much deeper insight” into the probabilities of extreme storms and heat waves that could push power demand to new peaks. Current industry risk analysis is not adequate, Robb said.

“This will require stronger modeling of fuel and capacity performance to assess reliability risk,” Robb said.",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/9d/1d/1d978ab84bc8b3c09111219c7a73/unlimiteduse-03-19-2025-white-house-isp-012.jpg,N,,2025-08-23 05:00:20.776367

The study, Europe’s Car Industry in Transition: Stuck in Neutral or Shifting into Gear?, warns that “standing still is not an option” for Europe’s carmakers as the global industry pivots to battery-electric vehicles. It argues that slowing the shift to EVs “does not stabilise the industry – it accelerates its decline.”

While the report focuses on the EU, its findings highlight challenges that are particularly acute for the UK. Car production in Britain has fallen to its lowest level since 1954, with post-Brexit supply chain disruption, rapidly escalating EV mandates, and inconsistent policy signals weighing on manufacturers.

“The problem isn’t demand,” the authors note, citing growing consumer interest in EVs across Europe. Instead, they argue, the real barrier is cost: average battery-electric vehicle prices in the Eurozone remain around 22% higher than comparable petrol models, a gap driven by manufacturers’ focus on premium offerings rather than affordable mass-market cars.

Several EU nations have begun to address this through coordinated industrial policy. Poland’s early investment in battery manufacturing has “sparked a regional cluster,” while France’s “Battery Valley” and Spain’s EV recovery schemes have attracted billions in investment. By contrast, the UK risks being isolated from these emerging value chains.

“National efforts can succeed,” the report says, “but without a broader ecosystem, they cannot compete with global leaders like China,” whose dominance in batteries and low-cost EVs poses a growing threat.

Campbell coal-fired plant in operation until November 19, 2025, due to concerns about reliability in the Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO) region.
Keeping the plant online after May cost Consumers Energy $29 million between May and June 2025, according to the utility’s latest quarterly filings.
Last Friday, The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) determined that the cost of keeping the plant online would be shared across MISO regions.
According to U.S. Environmental Protection Agency data cited by the DOE in its latest order, the Campbell Plant generated approximately 664,000 MWh over the month of June, running at a 61% capacity factor.","The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) has extended an emergency order that would keep the J.H. Campbell coal-fired plant in operation until November 19, 2025, due to concerns about reliability in the Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO) region.

Consumers Energy had planned to close the plant by May 31 of this year as part of a transition to cleaner energy. But DOE intervened just days earlier, saying the plant must remain open, at least until August 21, because of possible electricity shortfalls in the central U.S.

“The summer season has not yet ended, and the production of electricity from the Campbell Plant will continue to be a critical asset to maintain reliability in MISO this summer,” reads the DOE extension order from this week. “That need is evidenced by the fact that the Campbell Plant was called on by MISO to generate large amounts of electricity during the heat wave that hit MISO this past June.”

J.H. Campbell is a three-unit, 1,560 MW coal-fired plant in West Olive, Michigan. Its first unit came online in 1962. Eight utility commissions, along with several environmental groups, challenged DOE’s initial emergency order.

Keeping the plant online after May cost Consumers Energy $29 million between May and June 2025, according to the utility’s latest quarterly filings. Consumers said it has continued to make J.H. Campbell available and is seeking cost recovery of the $29 million through FERC and a proposed MISO Tariff modification. Last Friday, The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) determined that the cost of keeping the plant online would be shared across MISO regions.

According to U.S. Environmental Protection Agency data cited by the DOE in its latest order, the Campbell Plant generated approximately 664,000 MWh over the month of June, running at a 61% capacity factor.

MISO, which manages the flow of electricity in the central U.S., has said it should have adequate generating capacity this summer but faces “significant uncertainty” in overall resource adequacy projections.

Last month FERC approved MISO’s Expedited Resource Addition Study (ERAS), a temporary process designed to quickly bring up to 68 new generation projects online to address urgent load growth and reliability challenges. The program, which sunsets in 2027, ensures projects meet specific adequacy needs verified by state regulators, while aligning with long-term interconnection reforms.

However, DOE noted that “resources studied under the ERAS will have commercial operation dates that are at least three years away, and are provided an additional three year grace period to commence commercial operations.”

Additionally, the department noted supply chain constraints impeding the acquisition of large natural gas turbines and transformers that are likely to “further hinder rapid construction and exacerbate reliability concerns.”

J.H. Campbell is also not the first fossil-fired plant ordered to run past its expected retirement date due to resource adequacy concerns. The department also ordered the retention of Constellation’s two-unit Eddystone oil and gas power plant in Pennsylvania.

These mandates to override retirement plans could exceed $3 billion annually, according to a recent analysis by Grid Strategies, conducted on behalf of Earthjustice and other environmental groups.

Based on current trends and outreach to plant owners, DOE may attempt to require nearly all large fossil plants scheduled to retire before the end of 2028 to remain in service, the power sector consultant said. The low estimate here is 34,948 megawatts (MW) of capacity, and the high estimate is 66,337 MW.

Grid Strategies’ analysis uses the cost of recent Reliability Must Run (RMR) contracts as a proxy, estimating an average of $89,315/MW-year, though actual costs from recent DOE orders—such as Campbell’s—suggest this may be a conservative figure.

Under the low estimate, annualized ratepayer costs could exceed $3.1 billion by January 2029 as more plants are forced to stay online past their planned retirement dates.

In the high estimate scenario, applying a conservative 60-year plant age screen, DOE mandates could result in annual ratepayer costs exceeding $5.9 billion by the end of 2028, the analysis suggests.",https://www.power-eng.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image-10-2.jpg,N,,2025-08-23 02:59:24.033793

But the state highway system can utilize other methods to comply too, including street sweeping, stream restoration and pollution credits.
MDE officials had called the proposed restoration of 11% of impervious acreage “consistent with” Chesapeake Bay restoration goals, but said they heard the feedback and agreed to raise the target to 15%.
Thereby, reducing more pollutants from the stormwater sector toward the restoration of the Chesapeake Bay,” reads the permit document.
A 2022 suit by a number of environmental nonprofits challenging Maryland’s stormwater permit for industrial facilities is still underway.","A new stormwater permit meant to control runoff of polluted rainwater from state roads into state waterways is a “critical missed opportunity,” according to environmental groups, who say the new guidelines backtrack from previous requirements.

The five-year permit, issued Friday to the State Highway Administration by the Maryland Department of the Environment, sets a requirement of controlling runoff on more than 4,000 acres owned by SHA, which is backed up by $216 million in combined state and federal funding, officials said.

“This permit strengthens our ability to protect the Chesapeake Bay and the businesses and communities that rely on it, manage stormwater in overburdened areas, and make our state an even more desirable place to live,” Maryland Environment Secretary Serena McIlwain said in a statement Friday.

But advocates, from groups like the Chesapeake Bay Foundation and Maryland League of Conservation Voters, said the new permit actually targets less acreage than the last five-year permit did, and it largely leaves it to the SHA to decide what methods it will use to achieve runoff control.

Instead of flexibility, the advocates were hoping the new permit would require more effective runoff control measures, like tree plantings and stormwater ponds that trap water before it reaches natural waterways. But the state highway system can utilize other methods to comply too, including street sweeping, stream restoration and pollution credits.

After last Bay cleanup plan fell short, new proposal aims to be flexible, data-driven

The advocates say those methods aren’t as helpful, in part because they don’t do as much to stop harmful nutrients from running off the streets. Environmental groups and scientists have also cast doubt on the efficacy of some stream restoration projects, which modify stream banks in an effort to curtail erosion.

“We wanted [MDE] to put a cap on … the things that are of lesser value, and a bare minimum on the important things — and they just didn’t do that,” said Evan Isaacson, a senior attorney with the nonprofit Chesapeake Legal Alliance, which represents clients in environmental litigation.

Isaacson added that he remains hopeful that state officials will take the feedback into account, and select the most efficient methods to meet the permit requirements.

SHA spokesperson Shanteé Felix said in a statement that the agency will “utilize a balanced approach of MDE approved strategies that are feasible within the current budget to meet the requirements of the permit.”

Matt Stegman, a staff attorney for the Bay Foundation who focuses on Maryland, said the advocates’ preferred methods also provide more lasting change.

“If you plant a tree, eventually it’s going to be there for decades, as opposed to if you sweep the street, you’ve got to come do it again next week,” Stegman said.

Kim Coble, executive director of the Maryland League of Conservation Voters, said in a statement Friday that she doesn’t feel as though the permit takes a strong enough stance to ensure that projects happen in communities near state highways dealing with pollution and flooding concerns.

“Unfortunately, this permit takes a minimalistic approach that fails to prioritize projects addressing climate resilience and water quality in communities most burdened by pollution,” Coble wrote.

But an MDE news release noted the new permit requires SHA to report back about environmental restoration efforts in communities “with environmental justice concerns,” meaning they’re considered historically underserved and overburdened by pollution. The permit also allows for “expanded collaboration” with scientists and other experts to improve data collection, and includes $2.5 million in new funding to perform flood risk studies.

As much as they find shortcomings in the new permit, environmentalists acknowledge it could have been worse: A draft version of the permit released last year was severely criticized.

The previous permit required that SHA take runoff control measures on 20% of its total acreage. The 4,000 acres in the new plan represent 15% of SHA land — but that’s better than the 11% goal in last year’s draft version.

MDE officials had called the proposed restoration of 11% of impervious acreage “consistent with” Chesapeake Bay restoration goals, but said they heard the feedback and agreed to raise the target to 15%.

“As part of these discussions, … SHA indicated a desire to lead by example based on the most recent State budgetary projections: increasing the … commitment to 15% during the next permit term. Thereby, reducing more pollutants from the stormwater sector toward the restoration of the Chesapeake Bay,” reads the permit document.

Isaacson said he’s frustrated that SHA is being asked to restore less acreage than in the prior iteration of its permit. Advocates say that stormwater runoff is one of the more vexing categories of pollution endangering the effort to reduce pollution in the Chesapeake, making improvements all the more important.

Computer modeling data from the Chesapeake Bay Program shows that pollution from “developed” lands, largely stormwater, has increased since bay restoration efforts started in 1985, while other sources, including agriculture and wastewater treatment, have improved their numbers.

These stormwater permits, which are also issued for other sectors and for counties in Maryland, have been the subject of legal challenges in the past. A 2022 suit by a number of environmental nonprofits challenging Maryland’s stormwater permit for industrial facilities is still underway.

It unclear if a legal challenge is in the future for Friday’s permit.

The new permit comes at a challenging time for the multistate effort to improve the bay. After falling short of goals for 2025, the bay states have released a revised agreement, with a range of deadlines five, 10 and 15 years in the future. The Bay Program is accepting comments from the public on that plan through Sept. 1.

Isaacson said Friday’s permit is an example of how lackluster decisions by the participating states can sour the overall effort to meet the cleanup goals.

“They can say all these great things about what they’re committing to in the new bay agreement,” Isaacson said. “When they actually have to do something, they don’t make great decisions.”

A 2023 report from the Bay Program’s Scientific and Technical Advisory Committee, indicated the need for a more targeted approach to so-called “non-point” pollution — pollution, like stormwater, that doesn’t come directly from a facility’s discharge pipe. The report argued that states should cluster pollution reduction practices in areas with the greatest potential to reduce runoff into the bay.

“That status quo has been random acts of restoration,” Isaacson said. “That’s the status quo that we seek to change.”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-101/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/6918932-e1755954057672-1024x6831755954619.jpg?h=199d8c1f&itok=5BzX4ryb,N,,2025-08-23 12:04:24.183892

Her personal AI use isn’t unique anymore. Now it’s a feature in smartphones, search engines, word processors and email services. Every time someone uses AI, it uses energy that is often generated by fossil fuels. That releases greenhouse gases into the atmosphere and contributes to climate change.

And it’s getting harder to live without it.

The climate cost

AI is largely powered by data centers that field queries, store data and deploy information. As AI becomes ubiquitous, the power demand for data centers increases, leading to grid reliability problems for people living nearby.

“Since we are trying to build data centers at a pace where we cannot integrate more renewable energy resources into the grid, most of the new data centers are being powered by fossil fuels,” said Noman Bashir, computing and climate impact fellow with MIT’s Climate and Sustainability Consortium.

The data centers also generate heat, so they rely on fresh water to stay cool. Larger centers can consume up to 5 million gallons (18.9 million liters) a day, according to an article from the Environmental and Energy Study Institute. That’s roughly the same as the daily water demand for a town of up to 50,000 people.

It’s difficult to imagine, because for most users the impact isn’t visible, said AI and Climate Lead Sasha Luccioni with the AI company, Hugging Face.

“In one of my studies, we found that generating a high-definition image uses as much energy as charging half of your phone. And people were like, ‘That can’t be right, because when I use Midjourney (a generative AI program), my phone battery doesn’t go down,’” she said.

Jon Ippolito, professor of new media at the University of Maine, said tech companies are constantly working to make chips and data centers more efficient, but that does not mean AI’s environmental impact will shrink. That’s because of a problem called the Jevons Paradox.

“The cheaper resources get, the more we tend to use them anyway,” he said. When cars replaced horses, he said, commute times didn’t shrink. We just traveled farther.

Quantifying AI’s footprint

How much those programs contribute to global warming depends on a lot of factors, including how warm it is outside the data center that’s processing the query, how clean the grid is and how complex the AI task is.

Information sources on AI’s contributions to climate change are incomplete and contradictory, so getting exact numbers is difficult.

But Ippolito tried anyway.

He built an app that compares the environmental footprint of different digital tasks based on the limited data he could find. It estimates that a simple AI prompt, such as, “Tell me the capital of France,” uses 23 times more energy than the same question typed into Google without its AI Overview feature.

“Instead of working with existing materials, it’s writing them from scratch. And that takes a lot more compute,” Luccioni said.

And that’s just for a simple prompt. A complex prompt, such as, “Tell me the number of gummy bears that could fit in the Pacific Ocean,” uses 210 times more energy than the AI-free Google search. A 3-second video, according to Ippolito’s app, uses 15,000 times as much energy. It’s equivalent to turning on an incandescent lightbulb and leaving it on for more than a year.

It’s got a big impact, but it doesn’t mean our tech footprints were carbon-free before AI entered the scene.

Watching an hour of Netflix, for example, uses more energy than a complex AI text prompt. An hour on Zoom with 10 people uses 10 times that much.

“It’s not just about making people conscious of AI’s impact, but also all of these digital activities we take for granted,” he said.

Limit tech, limit tech’s climate impact

Ippolito said he limits his use of AI when he can. He suggests using human-captured images instead of AI-generated ones. He tells the AI to stop generating as soon as he has the answer to avoid wasting extra energy. He requests concise answers and he begins Google searches by typing “-ai” so it doesn’t provide an AI overview for queries where he doesn’t need it.

Loewen has adopted the same approach. She said she tries to organize her thoughts into one AI query instead of asking it a series of iterative questions. She also built her own AI that doesn’t rely on large data centers, which saves energy in the same way watching a movie you own on a DVD is far less taxing than streaming one.

“Having something local on your computer in your home allows you to also control your use of the electricity and consumption. It allows you to control your data a little bit more,” she said.

Luccioni uses Ecosia, which is a search engine that uses efficient algorithms and uses profits to plant trees to minimize the impact of each search. Its AI function can also be turned off.

ChatGPT also has a temporary chat function so the queries you send to the data center get deleted after a few weeks instead of taking up data center storage space.

But AI is only taking up a fraction of the data center’s energy use. Ippolito estimates roughly 85% is data collection from sites like TikTok and Instagram, and cryptocurrency.

His answer there: make use of screen time restrictions on your phone to limit time scrolling on social media. Less time means less personal data collected, less energy and water used, and fewer carbon emissions entering the atmosphere.

“If you can do anything that cuts a data center out of the equation, I think that’s a win,” Ippolito said.

“Since we are trying to build data centers at a pace where we cannot integrate more renewable energy resources into the grid, most of the new data centers are being powered by fossil fuels,” said Noman Bashir, computing and climate impact fellow with MIT’s Climate and Sustainability Consortium.

The data centers also generate heat, so they rely on fresh water to stay cool. Larger centers can consume up to 5 million gallons (18.9 million liters) a day, according to an article from the Environmental and Energy Study Institute. That’s roughly the same as the daily water demand for a town of up to 50,000 people.

It’s difficult to imagine, because for most users the impact isn’t visible, said AI and Climate Lead Sasha Luccioni with the AI company, Hugging Face.

“In one of my studies, we found that generating a high-definition image uses as much energy as charging half of your phone. And people were like, ‘That can’t be right, because when I use Midjourney (a generative AI program), my phone battery doesn’t go down,’” she said.

Jon Ippolito, professor of new media at the University of Maine, said tech companies are constantly working to make chips and data centers more efficient, but that does not mean AI’s environmental impact will shrink. That’s because of a problem called the Jevons Paradox.

“The cheaper resources get, the more we tend to use them anyway,” he said. When cars replaced horses, he said, commute times didn’t shrink. We just traveled farther.

Quantifying AI’s footprint

How much those programs contribute to global warming depends on a lot of factors, including how warm it is outside the data center that’s processing the query, how clean the grid is and how complex the AI task is.

Information sources on AI’s contributions to climate change are incomplete and contradictory, so getting exact numbers is difficult.

But Ippolito tried anyway.

He built an app that compares the environmental footprint of different digital tasks based on the limited data he could find. It estimates that a simple AI prompt, such as, “Tell me the capital of France,” uses 23 times more energy than the same question typed into Google without its AI Overview feature.

“Instead of working with existing materials, it’s writing them from scratch. And that takes a lot more compute,” Luccioni said.

And that’s just for a simple prompt. A complex prompt, such as, “Tell me the number of gummy bears that could fit in the Pacific Ocean,” uses 210 times more energy than the AI-free Google search. A 3-second video, according to Ippolito’s app, uses 15,000 times as much energy. It’s equivalent to turning on an incandescent lightbulb and leaving it on for more than a year.

It’s got a big impact, but it doesn’t mean our tech footprints were carbon-free before AI entered the scene.

Watching an hour of Netflix, for example, uses more energy than a complex AI text prompt. An hour on Zoom with 10 people uses 10 times that much.

“It’s not just about making people conscious of AI’s impact, but also all of these digital activities we take for granted,” he said.

Limit tech, limit tech’s climate impact

Ippolito said he limits his use of AI when he can. He suggests using human-captured images instead of AI-generated ones. He tells the AI to stop generating as soon as he has the answer to avoid wasting extra energy. He requests concise answers and he begins Google searches by typing “-ai” so it doesn’t provide an AI overview for queries where he doesn’t need it.

Loewen has adopted the same approach. She said she tries to organize her thoughts into one AI query instead of asking it a series of iterative questions. She also built her own AI that doesn’t rely on large data centers, which saves energy in the same way watching a movie you own on a DVD is far less taxing than streaming one.

“Having something local on your computer in your home allows you to also control your use of the electricity and consumption. It allows you to control your data a little bit more,” she said.

Luccioni uses Ecosia, which is a search engine that uses efficient algorithms and uses profits to plant trees to minimize the impact of each search. Its AI function can also be turned off.

ChatGPT also has a temporary chat function so the queries you send to the data center get deleted after a few weeks instead of taking up data center storage space.

But AI is only taking up a fraction of the data center’s energy use. Ippolito estimates roughly 85% is data collection from sites like TikTok and Instagram, and cryptocurrency.

His answer there: make use of screen time restrictions on your phone to limit time scrolling on social media. Less time means less personal data collected, less energy and water used, and fewer carbon emissions entering the atmosphere.

“If you can do anything that cuts a data center out of the equation, I think that’s a win,” Ippolito said.

National studies echo air quality concerns raised by CleanAIRE NC.
Addressing the problem Findings like these underscore the need for accessible information about air quality — which CleanAIRE is working to address through a new web platform, CleanAIRE Academy.
“The landscape of environmental health in North Carolina has drastically shifted in recent months,” CleanAIRE NC said in a statement.
“Air Quality 101” is designed to build a user’s foundation in air quality.","Since the start of the Trump administration, federal officials have been rolling back funding to federal environmental programs and scientific research — moves that threaten to leave vulnerable communities with fewer resources to address air quality concerns.That reality, along with the desire to broaden its reach, prompted the Charlotte-based advocacy group CleanAIRE NC to launch a new interactive online tool designed to educate North Carolinians on environmental issues and provide them with resources for healthier communities.

“Air pollution is an invisible and often understated problem, yet its impact on public health is profound,” said Rafi Vaca, CleanAIRE NC education manager. “We created this platform to demystify complex issues and inspire meaningful engagement.”

Mounting research reveals ongoing threats to air quality in urban and rural settings, from vehicle emissions, industrial sources and agriculture. One recent study found that residents living near concentrated animal feeding operations face significantly higher exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5): Levels were 28 percent higher near large cattle operations and 11 percent higher near industrial hog farms compared with communities farther away.

CleanAIRE NC has responded to air quality issues by partnering with communities across the state — from Charlotte’s Historic West End to rural Sampson County — to establish local air-quality monitoring and provide training and educational support for residents most affected by pollution.

A sense of urgency

Particulate matter, or particle pollution, is a mix of solid particles and liquid droplets in the air. Some, like dust, pollen or soot, are visible. Those usually fall in the range of PM10, particulate matter that is 10 micrometers, or about one-fifth the diameter of a human hair.

Other particles, such as PM2.5s, are so small they can only be seen with powerful microscopes, according to information provided by the EPA. Exposure to particle pollution can trigger serious health problems, including heart attacks, worsened asthma, reduced lung function and even premature death in people with heart or lung disease.

National studies echo air quality concerns raised by CleanAIRE NC. A 2022 report found higher risks of mortality across all age groups in U.S. regions with elevated PM2.5 levels — areas that often include vulnerable or low-income communities. The authors said the findings highlight the need for more equitable policies to improve air quality.

A 2018 study found that efforts to reduce PM2.5 levels in the U.S. from 1999 to 2013 resulted in a reduced mortality rate among elderly Americans, “worth $24 billion annually by the end of that period.”

Even as the Clean Air Act faces mounting challenges, environmental groups like CleanAIRE NC are working to bridge the gaps created by shifts in federal and state policy. The U.S. Supreme Court’s 2023 Sackett v. EPA decision redefined “Waters of the United States,” stripping federal protection from some wetlands. More recently, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced plans to re-evaluate the 2009 Endangerment Finding, which declared greenhouse gases a threat to public health. Leaders of CleanAIRE say that together, these developments illustrate the importance of efforts like theirs to inform and empower communities.

Addressing the problem

Findings like these underscore the need for accessible information about air quality — which CleanAIRE is working to address through a new web platform, CleanAIRE Academy.

“The landscape of environmental health in North Carolina has drastically shifted in recent months,” CleanAIRE NC said in a statement. “Growing concerns about our state’s readiness to handle potential environmental emergencies, coupled with recent legal changes, underscore the urgent need for informed community engagement. The CleanAIRE Academy offers a reliable, expert-backed source of information, with content developed by seasoned professionals in air quality, health, policy, advocacy and data science.”

“The CleanAIRE Academy greatly expanded my knowledge of air quality and advocacy,” said Naami Abbey, a student at the University of North CarolinaCharlotte, who described herself as “passionate” about environmental justice and community health.

Abbey was an early user.

“The self-paced courses made learning so much easier, deepening my understanding of air quality and how to turn concern into meaningful action for environmental justice,” she said.

How the academy works

The academy offers two learning modules. “Air Quality 101” is designed to build a user’s foundation in air quality. The second, “Advocacy in Action,” helps participants “learn to navigate policy, craft compelling messages, and engage effectively with decision-makers.”

Four more modules are planned: “Air Pollution and Your Health,” “Environmental Justice,” “AirKeeper Dashboard” and “Community Science and Air Monitoring.”

“CleanAIRE NC has had a history of providing this type of environmental and air pollution education, starting with Atrium Health Network residents,” said Vaca, Clean AIRE’s education manager. “That was to connect environmental factors and pollution to support health outcomes, especially since this is often missing from traditional medical school curricula.”

Vaca said that the shift to online learning will help the organization meet growing demand. “We can’t always take on additional projects like in-person trainings, but the requests we receive from communities facing pollution and other environmental challenges keep growing. So we wanted to scale our work to support them, even if we didn’t have a dedicated grant for their community.”

Vaca expects the academy to expand as it gains traction, to reach beyond their usual partners to transportation agencies or corporations.

“It’s for the public and our impacted communities,” Vaca said. “Now we want to grow it and expand it so it covers a lot more topics.”

Drawing on experience

The idea for the academy originated in house with staff experts in 2024.

“Part of the reason it’s taken so long is because we are getting expert advice and going through a full review process to gather feedback and update these courses so they meet the highest standards,” Vaca said.

The potential audience of academy users includes residents of affected communities, academics, students and policy makers, Vaca said.

In terms of what Vaca hopes academy course enrollees gain from the experience, she said: “I hope our participants or students see that these topics don’t have to be boring or intimidating.

“The takeaway should be that hope and resilience come when we lean on our communities, when we educate ourselves and support the work that is already being done for a cleaner environment.”

The UK’s newly unveiled 10-Year Infrastructure Strategy marks a pivotal moment for the country’s commitment to clean growth and sustainable development. Central to this bold vision is a record-breaking commitment to invest at least £725billion into economic and social infrastructure from 2025 to 2035, with an explicit focus on energy transition, the decarbonisation of industry, and regional economic opportunities.

The government’s ambition is to future-proof the nation, positioning the UK as a “clean energy superpower” while boosting jobs, local economies, and energy security.

This comprehensive strategy isn’t just about spending. It’s about making the UK the home of green technology, from sweeping investments in offshore and onshore wind to state-backed solar expansion and pioneering hydrogen projects. The formation of the new National Infrastructure and Service Transformation Authority (NISTA) ensures these ambitions move from planning to action, delivering infrastructure that supports clean growth targets, creates jobs, and enables innovations such as solar PV and battery storage—installations expertly handled by Atlantic Renewables.

Offshore Wind and Solar Are Driving the UK’s Renewable Revolution

The 10-Year Plan for infrastructure prioritises ambitious capacity targets for renewable energy. By 2030, the government is aiming for:

43-50GW of offshore wind

27-29GW of onshore wind

45-47GW of solar generation

These commitments come with public and private investment incentives designed to harness the UK’s natural assets and existing expertise. For solar specifically, this will mean a dramatic rise in rooftop and ground-mount solar installations, supporting the government’s targets for 95% of electricity to be low-carbon by the end of the decade.

If you want to participate in the UK’s clean energy transition with your own solar PV system, contact our team of expert engineers at Atlantic Renewables today for a custom solution!

What Are the Key Milestones for UK Clean Growth?

A defining feature of the new strategy is the suite of milestones set to drive the UK towards its clean growth ambitions. Some of the most significant include:

Launch of Great British Energy: With up to £8.3billion earmarked for renewable and nuclear projects over the upcoming Spending Review period, this state-backed body will invest directly in new energy infrastructure

Hydrogen Network Pioneering: Over £500million allocated to launch the UK’s first regional hydrogen transport and storage network, helping to decarbonise hard-to-electrify sectors

Carbon Capture, Usage and Storage (CCUS): £9.4billion for major CCUS clusters to capture industrial emissions at scale

Grid Upgrades: Ofgem has dedicated £8.9billion to the most significant National Grid expansion since the 1960s, improving renewable integration and grid resilience

By 2030, estimates suggest clean energy investment could reach over £30billion per year, facilitating the connection of up to 126GW of clean power to the grid.

How Will the Private Sector and Atlantic Renewables Support UK Goals?

Government funding alone cannot deliver the UK’s clean growth vision. The plan explicitly acknowledges that the vast majority of capital will come from private investment, with targets calling for £200billion by 2030 and up to £700billion by 2035 for energy infrastructure. This monumental mobilisation relies on clarity, regulatory certainty, and robust public-private partnerships.

For business , housing developers, and public sector bodies looking to benefit, working with trusted, experienced renewable energy partners such as Atlantic Renewables will be critical to unlocking these opportunities. Our team stands ready to guide clients from feasibility to installation and long-term maintenance, ensuring you meet the latest technical and regulatory standards.

Jobs Investment and the Economic Impact of Clean Growth

The UK’s green economy is no longer on the horizon—it is here and accelerating. In recent years, over 68,000 green jobs have already been created through targeted government initiatives, and private investment in clean growth has topped £22billion. By 2030, low-carbon industries are forecast to support more than 460,000 jobs, across manufacturing, engineering, installation, and R&D—making clean growth a pillar of national economic resilience.

The economic opportunity is vast, with estimates suggesting that UK low-carbon goods and services could generate between £60billion and £170billion in export sales by 2030. Atlantic Renewables continues to play a key role in this transformation, delivering scalable solar PV and battery storage solutions for homes and commercial clients around the UK.

What Does the 10-Year Strategy Mean for Solar Installations and Battery Storage?

For property owners and businesses, the Infrastructure Strategy offers both stability and opportunity. With meaningful policy support, enhanced grid connectivity, and clear targets for solar deployment, the next decade is set to be the most dynamic on record for UK-based solar PV and battery projects.

Expect:

Faster planning and connections thanks to the Strategic Spatial Energy Plan launching in 2026

Financial incentives and funding streams for both large-scale and decentralised renewable installations

Greater focus on skills training and workforce development to meet booming demand for installers and maintainers

European scientists have confirmed progress on a project that uses sensors and repair systems to keep batteries working for far longer than today’s models.

Current packs typically last around eight to fifteen years, but researchers say this technology could double that timespan.

If it works as planned, it may change how drivers think about electric vehicle ownership.

The race to build a tougher EV battery

Battery lifespan has been a central concern for electric vehicle buyers, with many questioning how long a pack can hold up before costly replacement.

The EU-funded PHOENIX project is testing a self-healing battery that monitors changes inside its cells and triggers repair when needed.

The aim is to extend usable life, improve reliability, and reduce the number of packs that end up as waste.

The EV battery system uses sensors to collect information on heat, voltage, swelling, and gas buildup, which can be early signs of damage.

When a problem is detected, the system can respond by applying controlled heat, reshaping the cell, or disrupting small metallic structures that form during charging.

These measures are designed to prevent failures that shorten performance or risk safety.

Johannes Ziegler, a materials scientist at Germany’s Fraunhofer Institute for Silicate Research ISC, told Horizon magazine that the goal is to increase lifetime while cutting resource demand.

Fewer replacements mean fewer materials mined and processed, which lowers both environmental impact and cost.

Adding more sensors and repair functions increases production expenses, but researchers are studying which ones provide the most benefit.

The long-term target is a smaller, lighter EV battery that performs more consistently over time.

What it means for electric vehicles

A self-healing EV battery could lower ownership costs by lasting well beyond 20 years, keeping the same pack in use for the lifetime of a car.

That longevity also means fewer batteries reaching recycling facilities, easing pressure on systems that process used packs.

Improved safety is another benefit. By preventing internal faults from escalating, the system reduces the risk of serious failure.

While studies show an electric vehicle is less likely to catch fire than a gasoline car, reinforcing consumer trust remains important for growth.

Work on self-healing battery technology is also underway outside Europe.

Teams in the United States and Asia are exploring new designs that stretch or repair themselves during use.

Inspection tools developed by other companies aim to spot flaws before packs ever leave the factory.

Together, these efforts show how the industry is moving toward batteries that are both more durable and more sustainable.

Analysts expect that combining longer battery lifespan with improved recycling and falling production costs will accelerate the shift to electric vehicles.

The following credits and deductions have been potential opportunities to the public sector—either via direct pay or another mechanism. Therefore, it’s important to understand how these incentives are changing based on adjustments from the OBBBA.

Credits & Deductions Repealed

Several incentives applicable to governmental and tax-exempt entities were repealed in the OBBBA.

Section 45W – Commercial Clean Vehicle Credit

Tax-exempt organizations can qualify for this credit when they purchase a qualifying vehicle under §45W. However, the OBBBA repealed this credit for vehicles purchased after September 30, 2025. For those placing in service vehicles before this date, the vehicles must still meet the applicable requirements, e.g., be made by a qualified manufacturer and meet battery capacity requirements. For more on the calculation and requirements of this credit, see our FORsight here.

§30C – Alternative Fuel Vehicle Refueling Property Credit

Tax-exempt and government entities may qualify for this credit when they purchase and install qualified refueling and recharging equipment. The OBBBA repealed this credit for property placed in service after June 30, 2026. Often referred to as the “charging station” credit, there are various requirements for what property qualifies. For example, the refueling property must be located in an eligible census tract (in a low-income community or that is not in an urban area). For more on the requirements of this property, see our FORsight here.

§179D – Energy Efficient Commercial Building Deduction

Tax-exempt and government entities can leverage this deduction by allocating it to the designers of Energy Efficient Commercial Building Property (EECBP) or Energy Efficient Commercial Building Retrofit Property (EEBRP). The OBBBA repealed this deduction for projects that begin construction after June 30, 2026.

As a reminder, to claim the deduction, EECBP and EEBRP must be part of:

Interior lighting systems

HVAC systems

Hot water systems

Building envelope

For more on the §179D deduction and OBBBA’s impact on this opportunity, see our FORsight here.

§45Y & 48E— Clean Electricity Investment & Production Credits

The OBBBA also made changes to the Clean Electricity Production Tax Credit (PTC) under §45Y and to the Clean Electricity Investment Tax Credit (ITC) under §48E.

While the credits remain available for many types of property, one of the biggest changes from the OBBBA applies to wind and solar facilities. To claim the credit for wind and solar facilities:

If construction begins by July 4, 2026, the facilities must be placed in service at the latest December 31, 2030.

If construction begins after July 4, 2026, the facilities must be placed in service by December 31, 2027.

Other eligible projects like geothermal, biogas, and battery storage can obtain the credit by beginning construction prior to December 31, 2033. Projects beginning after that date are eligible for reduced credits, and are phased out completely by 2036.

Regardless of property type, the OBBBA incorporated restrictions on the involvement of certain prohibited foreign entities—whether it be due to ownership, payments, or material assistance. Property that previously qualified may no longer, depending on where its components are sourced. These rules are complex—reach out to your experienced Forvis Mazars professional for more on this topic.

President Trump issued an executive order titled “ ,” which directs the Secretary of the Treasury to strictly enforce the termination of 45Y and 48E for wind and solar credits. The executive order also directs the Secretary of the Treasury to issue revised guidance to prevent the “beginning of construction” (BOC) from being manipulated to take advantage of the tax credit. Notice 2025-42 was issued on August 15, 2025, in response to this executive order. Previously, there were two accepted methods for establishing a BOC date. Generally speaking, this notice negates the ability to use the “5% safe harbor” for BOC, potentially making it more difficult for some entities to meet the previously mentioned OBBBA timing requirements for solar and wind facilities.

How Forvis Mazars Can Help

While some credits and deductions are ending or phasing out over the next several years, there is still time for tax exempt and government entities to take advantage of them. It is important to carefully consider the eligibility requirements and relevant deadlines for these credits and deductions when planning to make capital investments in clean energy. For the government or tax-exempt entity interested in taking advantage of clean energy credits and deductions, there are several questions to answer:

Consider organizational goals and current progress. Will you be able to meet the eligibility timelines?

Do you have projects that could be placed on an accelerated timeline to take advantage of the currently available credits?

Are you considering the prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements for the ITC and PTC?

Do you have a trusted consultant to help you navigate the nuanced compliance requirements and tax implications?

After consulting with the Department of Energy, the agency said it is granting full exemptions on 63 of the petitions, partial exemptions to 77 petitions, and denying 28 of the petitions.
The approved exemptions amounted to about 5.34 billion RINs, also known as Renewable Identification Numbers, the tradable compliance credits generated by blending biofuels into the fuel supply.
The renewable volume obligations set demand for the Renewable Identification Numbers market, and small refinery exemptions decrease demand.
Somewhat less thrilled was Chet Thompson, president and CEO of the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers trade group, which represents oil refiners.","WASHINGTON — The Environmental Protection Agency on Friday approved a backlog of requests from small oil refineries seeking exemptions from a federal mandate to blend biofuels like ethanol into the nation’s fuel supply.

In an announcement on its website, the EPA said it evaluated a total of 175 exemption requests from 28 small refineries, some going back as far as 2016.

After consulting with the Department of Energy, the agency said it is granting full exemptions on 63 of the petitions, partial exemptions to 77 petitions, and denying 28 of the petitions.

In addition, it said, it has decided seven of the petitions are ineligible for consideration.

The approved exemptions amounted to about 5.34 billion RINs, also known as Renewable Identification Numbers, the tradable compliance credits generated by blending biofuels into the fuel supply.

Friday’s action, however, is a mixed blessing. Because RINs have just a two-year lifespan, only 1.39 billion can still be used for compliance and retain any value, according to the EPA announcement.

Still, Patrick Serfass, executive director of the American Biogas Council, found plenty to be happy about in the agency’s decision.

“Issuing small refinery exemptions now, before [the next] renewable volume obligations are finalized, allows the EPA to balance both levers in the Renewable Fuel Standard to make sure they work together harmoniously and promote the healthy function of the RINs market,” Serfass said in a written statement.

The renewable volume obligations set demand for the Renewable Identification Numbers market, and small refinery exemptions decrease demand.

“Announcing the SREs now gives the EPA the opportunity to follow the recommendation from the American Biogas Council and other renewable fuel producers to increase RVOs, which would increase demand and balance out the impact of issuing SREs,” Serfass said.

“Without an increase in RVOs, RIN credit prices could crash, creating a harmful economic ripple effect across rural America. The EPA can make this all work together to protect farmers and rural communities, who depend on a strong, stable RFS program,” he added.

Somewhat less thrilled was Chet Thompson, president and CEO of the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers trade group, which represents oil refiners.

“We are glad EPA finally fulfilled its statutory obligation to act on SRE petitions. Yet, it is inexplicable that EPA is even considering adding more mandated biofuels on top of the largest and most expensive RFS mandate ever proposed by reallocating exempted volumes,” Thompson said.

“The 2026 and 2027 RFS would already cost refiners and consumers up to $70 billion each year and cannot be met with domestic feedstocks alone,” he continued. “Piling on more than a billion gallons in additional, reallocated mandates will do nothing other than increase imports, harm U.S. energy dominance and cost consumers.

“This is akin to your neighbor getting a tax break and the IRS showing up at your doorstep with the bill. It is simply wrong,” Thompson added.",https://www.thewellnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/biogas.jpg,N,,2025-08-23 12:03:50.446930

Representatives for Dominion did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the probe announced Thursday.","Dive Brief:

The U.S. Department of Commerce has opened a probe into “the effects on the national security of imports of wind turbines and their parts and components,” the agency said in a notice Thursday.

The investigation began Aug. 13 under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, which allows the president to restrict imports on national security grounds. The department will accept public comment on the case for 15 days after it appears in the Federal Register, which is scheduled for Monday.

Capstone analysts said in a note that they expect the Commerce Department to expedite the investigation and apply tariffs “likely around 25%-50%, consistent with other Section 232 duties imposed by this administration.”

Dive Insight:

The analysts said they expect tariffs to materially raise the cost of construction, estimating that a 10% increase in the input costs of an onshore wind project would raise its levelized cost of energy by 4%.

The U.S. imported wind components worth $2.83 billion last year, with Germany as the single largest source of imports, followed by Mexico, France and India, according to Capstone. The analysis noted that many wind components have also been hit by steel and aluminum tariffs.

The probe represents the latest escalation in President Donald Trump’s campaign against wind-powered electricity generation. In addition to successfully repealing most clean energy tax credits in the Republican domestic policy bill earlier this summer, the administration has also revoked permits for wind farms and rescinded designated offshore “wind energy areas” on the U.S. Outer Continental Shelf.

Just this week, Trump wrote in a post on social media that his administration “will not approve” wind or solar projects.

Utilities and developers with wind projects were facing rising costs even before the probe was announced.

Dominion Energy’s CEO said he expected the cost of the utility’s 2.6-GW Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind project to rise by about $506 million due to tariffs during an earnings call earlier this month. Despite the heftier price tag, the project was still on schedule for completion by the end of 2026. Once completed, Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind would be the largest capacity wind-powered generator in the country.

Representatives for Dominion did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the probe announced Thursday.

The Commerce Department said in the notice it is particularly interested in comments related to the concentration of U.S. imports of wind turbines “from a small number of suppliers or foreign nations and the associated risks,” the impact of “foreign government subsidies and predatory trade practices,” and “the potential for foreign control or exploitation of the wind turbine supply chain.”",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/qmHL1nTP6CyrN9PkFVRStdEg-z3bdBn0B_VxzwqV8Is/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9CbG9ja19Jc2xhbmRfd2luZF90dXJiaW5lc193YXZlcy5qcGc=.webp,N,,2025-08-23 02:59:28.600702

Piedmont Lithium has plans to open a $1 billion mine in Gaston County, west of Charlotte. Both companies jointly own a North America Lithium project in Quebec, Canada.

The new company will be headquartered in Australia, with its U.S. headquarters in Belmont. Following the nearly 50-50 equity holding split, the new company will be called Elevra Lithium.

The merger is not expected to upend the plans in Gaston County.

Lithium is used in batteries to power electric vehicles, bikes and personal electronic devices. But the price of lithium has continued to fall with slowing EV sales, causing companies to consolidate and delay projects.

About 30 seconds after opening the vote, at 11:11 a.m. on Friday, Piedmont Lithium’s Bruce Czachor, executive vice president and chief legal officer, read the results during a virtual shareholders meeting. Shareholders also could vote before Friday’s meeting.

“The preliminary results show that we have received votes and proxies sufficient to approve all proposals voted on today,” Czachor said.

The three proxies voted on were:

The proposal to adopt the agreement and plan of the merger announced Nov. 18, 2024.

An advisory vote on compensation that may be paid to Piedmont’s executive officers related to the merger.

A possible postponement of the special meeting to a later date to gather additional proxies if merger agreement votes are insufficient.

The official minutes of the meeting with the final vote tabulations will be filed with the SEC.

Shareholders were able to vote up until the polls were closed during the meeting, so there are additional votes that need to be confirmed and added to the results in order for them to be official, Malissa Gordon, vice president of government affairs for Piedmont Lithium told The Charlotte Observer on Friday.

“The remaining steps are largely customary in closing any merger,” Gordon said.

The vote had been adjourned twice due to lack of quorums, on July 31 and Aug. 11.

“This is a significant moment in the history of Piedmont Lithium,” Piedmont Lithium CEO Keith Phillips said Friday following the vote.

Piedmont Lithium was formed eight years ago, and now includes lithium mines in Canada and Ghana.

Four years ago, Piedmont announced it was planning a $1.2 billion lithium mine on over 1,500 acres east of Cherryville, about 25 miles west of Charlotte. Only 2% of the world’s lithium is available in the U.S., and North Carolina is among only a few places in the world where lithium mining is possible.

Piedmont’s joint acquisition with Sayona of its Quebec, Canada, lithium mine began operating in 2023. It is the largest lithium operation in North America, Phillips said Friday.

“It became increasingly clear to both Piedmont and Sayona that our future would be brighter as one larger, simpler, stronger company,” Phillips said. “Together, we will have a broader portfolio, increased scale and a lower cost structure.”

On Thursday, the updated closing timetable for the merger by Piedmont Lithium, following approval, shows the effective time of the merger is 4 p.m. Aug. 29, which is also the last day Piedmont shares will be traded. Sayona shareholders approved the merger in July.

About the new lithium mining company

The combined lithium business from the merger of Piedmont Lithium and Sayona Mining also is subject to regulatory approvals.

Sayona’s Lucas Dow will become CEO of the merged company, with Phillips acting as a strategic advisor during the transition.

The board for Elevra will be made up of four nominees from each company. The chair designated for Elevra Lithium is Dawne Hickton of Piedmont.

The estimated market capitalization of the new company is $623 million. Piedmont had 23 workers as of Dec. 31, according to the company’s 10-K filing. Reports show that Sayona has about 230 employees.

More about Piedmont Lithium

Piedmont Lithium reported $11.9 million in revenue at its second quarter earnings ending June 30.

Last year, Piedmont Lithium cut nearly half of its workforce in two layoffs amid the lithium market slump. In November, the company began looking for a funding partner for its Gaston County mining project.

The company also abandoned its Tennessee Lithium conversion plans in favor of its Carolina project.

The North Carolina project will add a second lithium hydroxide production train as part of a phased development, depending on market conditions, Piedmont Lithium said in Thursday’s merger timeline release.

“We are progressing our development of Carolina Lithium on a conservative timeline, monitoring dynamic market conditions and focusing on strategic partnerships and our funding strategy,” Phillips said during the earnings call.

Phillips said that although lithium prices remain depressed, the world continues to move toward electrification.

Piedmont Lithium is in the process of regulatory approvals for its North Carolina mine, about 25 miles west of Charlotte. Its air permit application is under review by North Carolina’s Division of Air Quality, the company reported during the earnings call Aug. 7.

Lithium mining in NC

The project is one of two lithium mines planned in North Carolina along the Carolina Tin-Spodumene Belt.

Large green areas in white pegmatite rock called spodumene are extracted to make lithium. North Carolina is among a few places in the world where lithium mining is possible. Piedmont has a contract with Tesla for its lithium.

The other project is from Charlotte-based Albemarle Corp., which is reopening a dormant lithium mine in Kings Mountain. Albemarle’s project is on nearly 1,200-acres in Cleveland County, about 30 miles west of Charlotte off Interstate 85.

Albemarle is the world’s largest lithium miner.

Irving-based Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE: CAT) and Dallas-based Hunt Energy have signed a long-term strategic agreement focused on delivering efficient, independent energy production to meet the demands of hyperscale and distributed data operations, Caterpillar announced this week.

Their first project—expected to launch in Texas—will kick off a multi-year plan to deploy up to 1 gigawatt of generation capacity across North America. The companies say the initiative lays the groundwork for future global expansion.

Melissa Busen, senior vice president of Caterpillar’s Electric Power division, said Hunt’s infrastructure experience complements Caterpillar’s power systems portfolio.

In a statement, she said the two companies plan to “jointly develop scalable solutions that meet the high demands of reliability, uptime, and performance critical to data center operations.”

Caterpillar, which reported $64.8 billion in 2024 sales and revenue, said it will supply a full range of power technologies, including natural gas and diesel generators, gas turbines, switchgear, controls, aftertreatment systems, and engineering services. The company also pointed to its advanced monitoring and servicing capabilities, designed to ensure uninterrupted power whether connected to the grid or running independently.

Hunt will lead development, financing, and execution for the projects. The company also brings experience in battery energy storage systems (BESS), having deployed more than 310 megawatts of BESS solutions over the past four years.

Founded in 1934, Hunt is a private, family-owned company with more than 90 years in global energy and real estate development. It operates across four continents and has developed a wide range of infrastructure, from upstream oil and gas to LNG terminals and high-voltage transmission systems.

That track record, Hunt says, positions the company to take on what’s next.

“Starting in Texas, we’re laying the foundation for a new era of data center power infrastructure,” Hunt Energy CEO Hunter Hunt said in a statement.

Section 3 of the Notice establishes rules for determining when this occurs. For example, for solar facilities, “physical work of a significant nature” may include the installation of racks or other structures to affix photovoltaic panels, collectors, or solar cells to a site.

In many ways, the Notice is good news for the wind and solar industry. Each had been concerned that the Treasury would issue rules that would not allow for a project to begin construction for tax purposes until a “significant portion of the facility is built.”

Although the Executive Order pursuant to which the Notice was issued directs Treasury to issue guidance on the Foreign Entity of Concern (FEOC) requirements, the Notice specifically states (in a footnote) that the Notice does not address the FEOC restrictions, including when construction begins for the “material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity” rules found in Section 45Y(b)(6) and 48E(b)(1)(E) of the Code, as amended by the OBBBA (the FEOC Equipment Rule), which only apply to projects beginning construction Jan. 1, 2026, or later.

Taxpayers also must maintain a continuous program of construction with respect to the facility. A continuous program of construction involves continuing physical work of a significant nature. Section 4.04 of the Notice provides a safe harbor that taxpayers may rely on to satisfy this requirement; outside the safe harbor, establishing continuity will be determined by the relevant facts and circumstances.

As McGuireWoods notes, “although the Notice does not contain specific language regarding work on a main power transformer (69 KV or greater), the applicable Treasury Regulations include in a qualified facility “transformers, inverters and converters which modify the characteristics of electricity into a form suitable for use, transmission or distribution.” Therefore, a popular safe harbor method whereby a taxpayer begins physical work of a significant nature on a main power transformer should continue to be available.”",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.15927_0026.jpg,N,,2025-08-23 06:59:33.499196

Pacifico Energy expects to eventually build out 5 GW of off-grid and gas-fired energy capacity, starting with 1 GW by 2028, to meet developing demand.
“GW Ranch isn’t just about scale—it’s about certainty,” said Constantyn Gieskes, vice president at Pacifico Energy.
“Every aspect of the project has been designed to solve problems with the status quo in data center development.

That’s the GW Ranch, a newly announced endeavor which is Pacifico’s planned off-grid power generation project under development in Pecos County, Texas. The 8,000+ acre site, presumably named for “gigawatt,” is being designed to pair natural gas-fired turbine generation with vast amounts of battery storage capacity.

All of that will be focused on directly meeting hyperscale data center and artificial intelligence (AI) load that would locate in the general area. Pacifico Energy expects to eventually build out 5 GW of off-grid and gas-fired energy capacity, starting with 1 GW by 2028, to meet developing demand.

“GW Ranch isn’t just about scale—it’s about certainty,” said Constantyn Gieskes, vice president at Pacifico Energy. “Every aspect of the project has been designed to solve problems with the status quo in data center development. By building off-grid and working hand-in-hand with local officials, we’re delivering the speed, reliability, and responsible development that our customers and communities both demand.”

Hype abounds in the energy transition industry and so-called ""Industrial Compute Age."" All kinds of ideas are going forward, only some of which will succeed, but the off-grid concept is gaining momentum due to the long interconnection queues in trying to integrate distributed energy resources with the utility grids.

Los Angeles-based Pacifico Energy plans to build GW Ranch completely unconnected to the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) grid system, thus avoiding many permitting delays. The company is working with Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ), Pecos County and local officials on the permitting it does require. TCEQ is leading the state permitting process.

“Pecos County’s continued effort to diversify the local economy directly aligns with the development of GW Ranch,” Remie Ramos, Pecos County Economic Development Director, said. “The minimal impact of an off-grid data center will increase the county tax base, create new jobs, and have an overall positive impact on our county while conserving water and placing no constraints on local infrastructure.”

Pecos County is situated in west Texas above the oil and gas-rich Permian Basin which supplies a large percentage of U.S. production. Pacifico is designing GW Ranch to include 5 GW of dedicated off-grid and gas-fired power generation, as well as 1.8 GW of energy storage.

The ERCOT grid nearly shut down in early 2021 after an extended winter storm coupled with 52 GW of electricity capacity knocked off-line. Those outages included gas-fired, renewable, nuclear, wind and gas wellheads within drilling sites.

Various forecasts predict that the race to achieve AI dominance for the U.S. will drive some 125 GW of new data center capacity online by sometime in the early 2030s. Many of those operational data centers are in northern Virginia and California, but Texas is growing as an attractive site for tech companies due to favorable regulatory and legislative moves in recent years.

Developer Crusoe, which is supported with private equity funding from an offshoot of Google parent company Alphabet, started construction on a data center in Abilene, Texas, which is focused on serving OpenAI and Oracle.

Pacifico Energy has worked on power projects across the world, including Vietnam, Korea and Japan. Many of those projects in the U.S. and abroad have distributed energy and microgrids, but the company is shifting into prime power projects which directly meet main load for facilities.

Pacifico is financially backed by a variety of large-scale investors, including Sumitomo, Goldman Sachs, GE Energy Financial Services, Shinsei Bank and Dragon Capital, among others.","https://img.energytech.com/files/base/ebm/energytech/image/2025/08/68a87d6ac9c895e2edec79aa-natural_gas_dreamstime.png?auto=format,compress&fit=fill&fill=blur&w=1200&h=630",N,,2025-08-23 05:00:28.699615

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The Trump administration plans to make available about 20 metric tons of Cold War-era plutonium from dismantled nuclear warheads to U.S. power companies as a potential fuel for reactors, according to a source familiar with the matter and a draft memo outlining the plan.

Plutonium has previously only been converted to fuel for commercial U.S. reactors in short-lived tests. The plan would follow through on an executive order signed by President Donald Trump in May ordering the government to halt much of its existing program to dilute and dispose of surplus plutonium, and instead provide it as a fuel for advanced nuclear technologies.

The Department of Energy, or DOE, plans to announce in coming days it will seek proposals from industry, said the source who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The source cautioned that because the plan is still a draft, its final details could change pending further discussions.

The plutonium would be offered to industry at little to no cost — with a catch. Industry will be responsible for costs of transportation, designing, building, and decommissioning DOE-authorized facilities to recycle, process and manufacture the fuel, the memo said.

The details on the volume of the plutonium, industry’s responsibilities in the plan and the potential timing of a U.S. announcement, have not been previously reported. The 20 metric tons would be drawn from a larger, 34-metric-ton stockpile of weapons-grade plutonium that the United States had previously committed to dispose of under a non-proliferation agreement with Russia in 2000.

The Department of Energy did not confirm or deny the Reuters reporting, saying only that the department is “evaluating a variety of strategies to build and strengthen domestic supply chains for nuclear fuel, including plutonium,” as directed by Trump’s orders.

Boosting the U.S. power industry is a policy priority for the Trump administration as U.S. electricity demand rises for the first time in two decades on the boom in data centers needed for artificial intelligence.

The idea of using surplus plutonium for fuel has raised concerns among nuclear safety experts who argue a previous similar effort failed.

Under the 2000 agreement, the plutonium was initially planned to be converted to mixed oxide fuel, or MOX, to run in nuclear power plants. But in 2018, the first Trump administration killed the contract for a MOX project that it said would have cost more than $50 billion.

The U.S. Energy Department holds surplus plutonium at heavily guarded weapons facilities including Savannah River in South Carolina, Pantex in Texas, and Los Alamos in New Mexico. Plutonium has a half-life of 24,000 years and must be handled with protective gear.

Until Trump’s May order, the U.S. program to dispose of the plutonium has involved blending it with an inert material and storing it in an experimental underground storage site called the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) in New Mexico.

The Energy Department has estimated that burying the plutonium would cost $20 billion.

“Trying to convert this material into reactor fuel is insanity. It would entail trying to repeat the disastrous MOX fuel program and hoping for a different result,” said Edwin Lyman, a nuclear physicist at the Union of Concerned Scientists.

“The excess plutonium is a dangerous waste product and DOE should stick to the safer, more secure and far cheaper plan to dilute and directly dispose of it in WIPP.”

WEST DES MOINES, IA – The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has issued a long-awaiting decision on 175 Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) refinery exemption (SRE) requests dating from 2016 to 2024. In total, the EPA granted 63 full exemptions and 77 partial exemptions totaling 5.34 billion gallons. EPA denied 28 claims and found another 7 ineligible.

“We must get RFS refinery waiver uncertainty out of the market and today’s action by EPA takes a big step forward,” said Iowa Renewable Fuels Association (IRFA) Executive Director Monte Shaw. “While we can quibble with the justification of the SREs granted, the EPA was spot-on in reissuing the same retired RFS credits back to the refiners who received an exemption. This is consistent with past actions when the shoe was on the other foot and is in line with the overall goals of the RFS. One absolutely vital question remains: how or if the SREs from 2023 to 2025 will be reallocated. That is a two-billion-gallon uncertainty hanging over the market and the pending RFS blending rule for 2026 and 2027.”

Also today, EPA announced that in the near future it will release a proposed rule to outline how the exempted RFS volumes of the 2023 and later compliance years, expected to be over two billion gallons, could be reallocated. EPA has previously stated that it will account for projected SREs for 2026 and 2027 when finalizing the RFS blending levels for those years. EPA stated: “The supplemental proposal will seek to balance the goals of the RFS in supporting the production and use of renewable fuels while taking into account economic impacts, following the law, and ensuring opportunity for stakeholder comment.”

“Full and complete reallocation of the 2023 and newer SREs is the vital point,” stated Shaw. “In the end, that will determine whether the EPA upholds President Trump’s commitment to the RFS and to American farmers. If true reallocation does not occur, then EPA is effectively reducing the already low RFS blending levels for 2025. IRFA was heartened by EPA’s announcement today that it will propose reallocating the exempted volumes. We now anxiously await EPA’s reallocation proposal, at which time we will be commenting in the strongest possible terms that reallocation of every SRE gallon must occur, and we will implore the EPA to end the SRE uncertainty before finalizing the 2026-2027 RFS rule.”

When granted, SREs allow a refinery out of their blending obligation under the landmark RFS program, which is the bedrock renewable fuels policy in the U.S. The EPA sets an RFS blending level for each year. As a result, any SRE effectively reduces the RFS blending level. To avoid this, the RFS law called on EPA to estimate the amount of SREs likely to be granted and to factor this into the RFS blending level formula each year, a process commonly referred to as “reallocation” because it essentially upholds the RFS blending level while shifting any exempted obligation from those parties to the obligated parties that did not receive exemptions.

“IRFA has loudly applauded the Trump administration and the EPA for the proposing record-high RFS blend levels for 2026 and 2027,” stated Shaw. “We would hate to see these volumes rendered meaningless due to billions of gallons of un-reallocated SREs. So while we greatly appreciate that the Trump Administration has signaled they will reallocate 2023 and newer refinery waivers, we must examine those details. At the end of the day, the penalty for the failure of the previous RFS rules under the prior administration to include SRE forecasts should not be paid solely by renewable fuels producers. The integrity of the RFS depends on it.”

The Iowa Renewable Fuels Association represents the state’s liquid renewable fuels industry and works to foster its growth. Iowa is the nation’s leader in renewable fuels production with 42 ethanol refineries capable of producing 4.7 billion gallons annually – including 34 million gallons of annual cellulosic ethanol production capacity – and 10 biodiesel facilities with the capacity to produce 416 million gallons annually.

Mobilize has partnered with Andersen to offer colorful wall chargers to customers purchasing EVs from three automotive brands.

Those who purchase cars ranging from city runabouts to spacious family vehicles can now get a seven-kilowatt charger professionally installed at the promotional price.

The deal applies to buyers of six specific models, including the compact, city-friendly Dacia Spring, the retro-styled Renault 5, the practical Renault 4, the family-oriented Renault Scenic, the sleek Renault Megane, and the sporty Alpine A290. Each vehicle can be paired with a home charger that matches the owner's style.

Buyers can pick from 200 different colors for their wall unit, which also works with rooftop solar panels. This allows drivers to fuel their cars using solar energy from their own homes. For those interested in solar power, compare quotes from local installers with EnergySage.

The wall units simplify life for EV owners by allowing them to plug in overnight at home, eliminating the need to hunt for public charging stations. These chargers communicate with power companies to juice up cars when electricity costs drop to around 6.7 pence per kilowatt-hour, putting hundreds of pounds back in drivers' pockets each year.

Smart charging compatibility means the units can work with popular energy plans that offer the lowest rates during off-peak hours.

Making home charging cheaper and easier means fewer gas-powered cars on roads, which cuts down on harmful exhaust fumes. Reduced pollution leads to healthier breathing for everyone, particularly children and seniors, whose lungs are most susceptible to dirty air.

Business leaders celebrated what this deal could mean for drivers. Rosa Aguirre of Mobilize said the arrangement gives customers top-tier charging that complements their vehicles' modern features.

The company has since fallen into bankruptcy, failed to deliver hundreds of the buses it promised, and warned school districts that its dire financial straits prevent it from servicing those in circulation.

As a result, many of those districts are turning back to diesel.

The Washington Free Beacon reported earlier this year that Lion, then nearing bankruptcy, had yet to deliver $95 million worth of the electric buses it pledged to produce as part of the Biden administration's $5 billion Clean School Bus program. Since then, Lion was sold for just $6 million during bankruptcy proceedings after being valued at $4.7 billion as recently as June 2021. The company also permanently shuttered multiple manufacturing plants, fired the majority of its employees, and told consumers that it could no longer honor warranties and purchase orders in the United States.

Lion's dramatic fall from grace marks one of the most apparent failures stemming from Democrats' green energy agenda, particularly as school districts turn back to the diesel-powered vehicles the Clean School Bus program was designed to phase out.

""All of our contacts from Lion that we worked so closely with to ensure the project's success have been fired,"" Mike Leskowich, superintendent of the Homer Community School District in southern Michigan, told the Free Beacon. ""We are going to keep our electric fleet on the roads for as long as possible. Eventually, however, we will return to diesel, as the cost of the vehicle is far less than electric.""

Leskowich, whose district received $2.8 million in federal funding to procure seven Lion buses in 2022, added that Homer schools have started sourcing their own parts to repair their buses. He told the Free Beacon that it ""does hurt"" that the buses' warranties are no longer valid.

Charlie Butler, superintendent of the Madison Parish School District in northern Louisiana, said the 14 Lion buses his district received are still new, but that he is struggling to find companies that can repair them.

""Some of the issues do require funding, which we are managing at this time,"" Butler told the Free Beacon.

Established by Democrats' 2021 infrastructure bill, the Clean School Bus Program emerged as one of the Biden administration's signature climate initiatives.

""Who doesn't love a yellow school bus, right?"" then-vice president Kamala Harris asked when promoting the program in 2022. ""It's part of a nostalgia, a memory of the excitement and joy of going to school to be with your favorite teacher, to be with your best friends, and to learn. The school bus takes us there.""

Climate activists have advocated for school districts to transition from their diesel-powered bus fleets to electric ones to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Electric buses, however, are prohibitively expensive for most school districts. They cost more than $350,000 on average, whereas new diesel-powered buses typically cost around $100,000, according to environmental think tank Resources for the Future. They also require districts to invest in high-powered charging infrastructure and new training for drivers.

Several school districts across the country have completely removed their Lion buses from service over mechanical and safety concerns. A superintendent for a Midwest school district told industry publication Clean Trucking the district's buses could not heat up in cold weather, lost steering and braking ability at times, had defective frames, and regularly displayed error messages that forced drivers to reset the vehicles.

""The buses do not run for more than a month before needing more repairs,"" Coleen Souza, assistant to the superintendent of Winthrop Public Schools in Maine, told Clean Trucking.

School officials whose districts have not received the Lion buses the Biden administration had promised them are losing hope that their vehicles will ever arrive.

""We have not received any buses,"" Dawn Wallace, superintendent of the Ohio Valley School District in Adams County, Ohio, told the Free Beacon. ""At this point, we are not really hopeful that we will. We will maintain our diesel-powered fleet and, yes, continue to purchase those in the future."" Jason Stabler, superintendent of the Bureau Valley School District in Manlius, Ill., echoed Wallace's concerns.

""The situation remains unresolved at this time, and we are currently waiting to see how it will be addressed and resolved by the court system,"" Stabler said.

Environmental Protection Agency spokeswoman Brigit Hirsch told the Free Beacon in a statement that the agency is actively monitoring Lion's bankruptcy proceedings and ""evaluating all options."" She referred the Free Beacon to the Department of Justice for further questions.

Travis Fisher, director of energy and environmental policy studies at the Cato Institute, told the Free Beacon that the problems Lion's situation present were a predictable consequence of the Biden administration's policies.

""For anyone who thought the transition to EVs would be easy or even profitable, this is yet another example that perhaps there will be large bumps in the road,"" Fisher said.",https://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/vice-president-harris-delivers-remarks-on-electric-school-buses-scaled-e1722029972340.jpg,N,,2025-08-22 23:00:26.896052

However, the Trump-era policy shifts from 2017 to 2021 created a volatile landscape, exposing foreign firms to unprecedented strategic and financial risks. This article dissects the implications of these policies on companies like Orsted and evaluates opportunities in resilient sectors and regions that have weathered political turbulence.

The Trump-Era Policy Tsunami

The Trump administration's approach to offshore wind was marked by abrupt regulatory reversals and a pro-fossil fuel agenda. On January 20, 2017, President Trump signed an executive order halting all federal offshore wind permits, leasing, and project approvals. This pause, initially framed as a temporary review, persisted for years, creating a vacuum of certainty. By 2025, the administration had further compounded the chaos with the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), which eliminated tax credits for wind and solar projects unless construction began within 12 months of enactment.

For Orsted, the consequences were severe. The company's Revolution Wind and Sunrise Wind projects, valued at $4 billion and $924 million respectively, faced delays, impairments, and a forced $9.4 billion capital raise. Orsted's 2023 impairment of $5.7 billion on its Ocean Wind 1 and 2 projects—canceled due to permitting delays—highlighted the financial strain. The administration's “Unleashing American Energy” executive order, which prioritized oil and gas over renewables, further eroded investor confidence.

Strategic Risks for Foreign Investors

The Trump-era policies introduced three critical risks for foreign firms:

1. Regulatory Uncertainty: Frequent executive orders and permit freezes made long-term planning impossible. Orsted's inability to sell a stake in its Sunrise Wind project—despite 35% completion—exemplifies how political shifts can paralyze capital flows.

2. Financial Volatility: Tax credit cliffs and permitting delays forced companies to accelerate timelines or face losses. Orsted's 2025 impairment of $575 million on the Revolution Wind project underscores the fragility of offshore wind's business model under such conditions.

3. Market Exit Risks: The administration's favoritism toward fossil fuels created an uneven playing field. Shell and Equinor, like Orsted, recorded billions in impairments, signaling a broader retreat from U.S. offshore wind.

Resilient Sectors and Regions

Despite the federal headwinds, certain U.S. states and international markets have demonstrated resilience.

1. State-Level Commitments:

- Washington, Minnesota, and North Carolina maintained aggressive renewable energy mandates, streamlining permitting and grid connectivity to meet clean energy targets. Minnesota's deputy commissioner, Pete Wyckoff, emphasized that wind and solar remain the most cost-effective solutions for meeting electricity demand, even without federal tax credits.

- New York and New Jersey continued to advance offshore wind projects, albeit with delays. The Empire Wind project, though temporarily halted by the Trump administration, resumed after negotiations with state officials.

2. International Markets:

- Europe and Asia have become safer havens for offshore wind investment. Orsted's pivot to projects in the UK, Germany, and South Korea reflects a strategic shift toward markets with stable regulatory frameworks.

- Emerging Markets: Countries like Brazil and Vietnam are fast-tracking offshore wind development, offering growth potential with less political risk.

Investment Advice for Navigating the Storm

For investors, the key lies in diversification and due diligence:

- Prioritize Resilient Jurisdictions: Allocate capital to states with long-term renewable mandates (e.g., Washington, Minnesota) and international markets with stable policies.

- Diversify Portfolios: Balance U.S. offshore wind investments with onshore solar and wind projects in states like Texas, which have less federal regulatory exposure.

- Monitor Policy Cycles: Given the cyclical nature of U.S. energy policy, investors should hedge against political risks by engaging in advocacy or partnerships with state governments.

Conclusion

The Trump-era policies have left a lasting scar on the U.S. offshore wind sector, but they have also revealed opportunities in resilient regions and international markets. For foreign firms like Orsted, the path forward requires adaptability and a focus on jurisdictions where policy stability aligns with long-term strategic goals. Investors who navigate this landscape with caution and foresight can still capitalize on the renewable energy transition, even amid political storms.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-23 00:00:03.831460

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The Trump administration plans to make available about 20 metric tons of Cold War-era plutonium from dismantled nuclear warheads to U.S. power companies as a potential fuel for reactors, according to a source familiar with the matter and a draft memo outlining the plan.

Plutonium has previously only been converted to fuel for commercial U.S. reactors in short-lived tests. The plan would follow through on an executive order signed by President Donald Trump in May ordering the government to halt much of its existing program to dilute and dispose of surplus plutonium, and instead provide it as a fuel for advanced nuclear technologies.

The Department of Energy, or DOE, plans to announce in coming days it will seek proposals from industry, said the source who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The source cautioned that because the plan is still a draft, its final details could change pending further discussions.

The plutonium would be offered to industry at little to no cost — with a catch. Industry will be responsible for costs of transportation, designing, building, and decommissioning DOE-authorized facilities to recycle, process and manufacture the fuel, the memo said.

The details on the volume of the plutonium, industry’s responsibilities in the plan and the potential timing of a U.S. announcement, have not been previously reported. The 20 metric tons would be drawn from a larger, 34-metric-ton stockpile of weapons-grade plutonium that the United States had previously committed to dispose of under a non-proliferation agreement with Russia in 2000.

The Department of Energy did not confirm or deny the Reuters reporting, saying only that the department is “evaluating a variety of strategies to build and strengthen domestic supply chains for nuclear fuel, including plutonium,” as directed by Trump’s orders.

Boosting the U.S. power industry is a policy priority for the Trump administration as U.S. electricity demand rises for the first time in two decades on the boom in data centers needed for artificial intelligence.

The idea of using surplus plutonium for fuel has raised concerns among nuclear safety experts who argue a previous similar effort failed.

Under the 2000 agreement, the plutonium was initially planned to be converted to mixed oxide fuel, or MOX, to run in nuclear power plants. But in 2018, the first Trump administration killed the contract for a MOX project that it said would have cost more than $50 billion.

The U.S. Energy Department holds surplus plutonium at heavily guarded weapons facilities including Savannah River in South Carolina, Pantex in Texas, and Los Alamos in New Mexico. Plutonium has a half-life of 24,000 years and must be handled with protective gear.

Until Trump’s May order, the U.S. program to dispose of the plutonium has involved blending it with an inert material and storing it in an experimental underground storage site called the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) in New Mexico.

The Energy Department has estimated that burying the plutonium would cost $20 billion.

“Trying to convert this material into reactor fuel is insanity. It would entail trying to repeat the disastrous MOX fuel program and hoping for a different result,” said Edwin Lyman, a nuclear physicist at the Union of Concerned Scientists.

“The excess plutonium is a dangerous waste product and DOE should stick to the safer, more secure and far cheaper plan to dilute and directly dispose of it in WIPP.”

While the R2's launch and gross margin improvements justify optimism, the stock's valuation remains stretched.","In the volatile world of electric vehicles (EVs), Rivian Automotive (RIVN) has emerged as a polarizing name. Its recent 7.4% stock surge in 2025 has sparked debates: Is this a sustainable rally driven by fundamentals, or a speculative frenzy fueled by short-covering and market hype? To answer this, we must dissect Rivian's financial health, competitive positioning, and the broader EV sector dynamics shaping its trajectory.

Fundamentals: A Mixed Bag of Progress and Challenges

Rivian's Q2 2025 results revealed a 12.52% year-over-year revenue increase to $1.3 billion, driven by a 10-month high in U.S. sales. The company's gross margin improvement—its first positive gross margin in history—is a critical milestone. However, profitability remains elusive, with a wider-than-expected loss of -$0.97 per share and adjusted EBITDA losses projected between $2 billion and $2.25 billion for 2025.

The R2 model, priced under $50,000, is a key catalyst. With over 100,000 reservations and a projected positive gross margin, R2 could unlock mass-market demand. Rivian's $7.5 billion cash reserves and a $1 billion investment from Volkswagen Group (at a 33% premium) further bolster its financial position. Yet, challenges persist: production bottlenecks, the phase-out of federal EV tax credits, and regulatory credit sales declines (from $300 million to $160 million in 2025) threaten near-term margins.

Short-Covering and Market Dynamics: A Volatile Catalyst

Rivian's short interest of 21.18% (151.1 million shares) is among the highest in the EV sector, outpacing Tesla (2.17%) and Ford (4.64%). This creates a short-squeeze risk, especially if the stock continues its upward trajectory. In late July 2025, a 19.6% quarter-over-quarter rally—spurred by robotaxi market speculation and a potential Lyft partnership—forced short sellers to cover positions, amplifying buying pressure.

However, short-covering alone cannot sustain a rally. The EV sector's broader momentum, driven by robotaxi advancements and U.S. manufacturing incentives, has created a tailwind. Rivian's niche in electric trucks and SUVs, coupled with its Amazon partnership (20,000+ delivery vans delivered), differentiates it from pure-play EVs like Lucid. Yet, competition from Tesla's Cybertruck and Ford's F-150 Lightning remains fierce.

Competitive Positioning: Niche vs. Mass Market

Rivian's focus on premium trucks and SUVs has allowed it to avoid direct competition with Tesla's Model 3/Y in the mass-market segment. Its R2 model, however, targets the under-$50,000 bracket—a crowded space dominated by Tesla and emerging rivals like Maverick. While Rivian's brand equity and customer satisfaction scores are strong, its ability to scale production and reduce costs will determine its long-term viability.

Risk-Reward Analysis: Balancing Optimism and Caution

For investors, Rivian presents a high-risk, high-reward proposition. Key risks include:

- Regulatory headwinds: The loss of federal tax credits and regulatory changes could erode margins.

- Production delays: The R2's 2026 launch timeline is critical; any delays could dampen investor confidence.

- Insider selling: CEO Robert Scaringe and CFO Claire McDonough's share sales in 2025 raise questions about management's conviction.

Conversely, the rewards are substantial:

- Growth potential: The R2 and R3 models could drive revenue to $7.68 billion by 2026.

- Strategic partnerships: Volkswagen's investment and potential Lyft collaborations offer scalability.

- Short-squeeze upside: A sustained rally could trigger a self-reinforcing cycle of buying pressure.

Investment Advice: A Conditional Buy

Rivian's rally is a blend of fundamental progress and speculative momentum. While the R2's launch and gross margin improvements justify optimism, the stock's valuation remains stretched. At $12.49 (as of August 2025), Rivian trades at a 40% discount to its 2023 peak but still carries a price-to-sales ratio of 1.5x, higher than Tesla's 0.8x.

For aggressive investors: A strategic entry point exists if Rivian's share price dips below $10, supported by positive R2 production updates or a short-squeeze catalyst.

For cautious investors: Wait for clearer signs of profitability, such as EBITDA breakeven by 2027 or regulatory clarity on tax credits.

In conclusion, Rivian's 7.4% surge reflects a market betting on its long-term potential. However, sustainability hinges on executing its R2 roadmap, navigating regulatory shifts, and outpacing competitors. For now, it remains a speculative play with asymmetric upside—but one that demands close monitoring of key catalysts.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-23 04:00:43.360399

Legislation Will Nearly Double Clean Energy Capacity, Reducing Electric Bill Costs

LAWRENCEVILLE – Governor Phil Murphy today signed into law S4530/A5768 and A5267/S4289 as part of the Murphy Administration’s ongoing commitment to addressing the regional energy cost crisis by putting New Jersey on a path to nearly double its capacity to deliver affordable, reliable, and renewable energy by 2030. This legislation will facilitate the swift expansion of solar access for 450,000 additional New Jerseyans, including 250,000 low-income families, which will enable the equivalent of one million households to receive solar power by 2028. These bills will also help lower energy costs by vastly accelerating the construction of energy storage facilities across the state. The Governor was joined by legislative sponsors, local leaders, union members, and advocates at IBEW Local 269 in Lawrenceville.

S4530/A5768 directs the Board of Public Utilities (BPU) to open registration by October 1, 2025 for an additional 3,000 megawatts of community solar projects. This will mark a massive expansion of New Jersey’s nation-leading solar programs and help hardworking families and businesses save money on their monthly electric bills.

A5267/S4289 establishes a transmission-scale energy storage incentive program to achieve New Jersey's goal of 2,000 megawatts of energy storage by 2030. The program seeks to rapidly install new clean energy capacity and reduce costs for New Jersey’s energy customers.

In an effort to provide necessary energy alternatives, these pieces of legislation allow for the rapid expansion of New Jersey’s community solar program and swift creation of new energy storage facilities. Solar capacity has increased from 2.4 gigawatts to 5.2 gigawatts under the Murphy Administration, with solar currently powering the equivalent of over 600,000 homes.

“Today, we are taking immediate and far-reaching steps to lower energy costs for every household in New Jersey,” said Governor Murphy. “By accelerating the process for bringing new sources of energy online and rapidly building new energy storage facilities, we will meet growing demand while also making life more affordable for our state’s families. As part of this process, we are going to create good-paying, union jobs and build a cleaner, more resilient future for every New Jerseyan.”

""I want to thank Governor Murphy for his leadership in advancing clean power solutions for New Jersey,"" said NJBPU President Christine Guhl-Sadovy. ""This legislation addresses real problems. More New Jerseyans will get access to the benefits of expanded community solar programs—one of the best ways for residents to lower their utility bills while contributing to clean energy in the Garden State. And large-scale battery storage will strengthen our electric grid and keep the lights on when we need it most. This is how we build a grid that works for everyone.""

The two bills signed today build upon the Murphy Administration’s ongoing efforts to mitigate rising energy costs due to mismanagement by regional grid operator PJM.

Other notable measures that the Murphy Administration has taken include:

ACC Vice Chair Nick Myers said the renewable energy mandates are outdated and that utilities should be able to have the flexibility to choose their energy mix themselves without being burdened by government-imposed rules. He said renewable energy mandates drive up costs for customers, but he did not provide support to explain this conclusion.

REST generated gross benefits for utility customers and the public totaling over $1.5 billion for Arizona Public Service (APS) and over $469 million for Tucson Electric Power (TEP) from 2008 to 2018, a 2020 report by Ceres found. The study also found REST resulted in an estimated $12 billion in clean-energy investments.

“It is naive to think that repealing the REST will not have direct impacts on Arizona families,” said Itzel Rios-Vega, Vote Solar’s Interior West regional director. “We urge the commission not to surrender its responsibility to guide Arizona’s energy future.”

For arid regions like Arizona, solar is particularly important because it uses far less water than other forms of generation. From 2008 to 2018, REST played “a crucial role in reducing pollution and delivering substantial water savings of 7,129-acre feet annually- enough water to serve the needs of nearly 44,000 Arizonans each year, an invaluable resource in our arid state,” the Ceres report found.

Additionally, because Arizona has no significant gas reserves, it must import gas from out of state. However, Arizona is drenched in sunshine to tap for energy generation, so much so that it holds the Guinness Book of World Records for “most sunshine.”

The public’s concerns extend beyond clean energy, saving water and lowering costs.

The retirement of renewable energy credits (RECs) is Arizona’s only legal mechanism to ensure exclusive claims over renewable generation, said Lucas Grimes, a senior manager of policy at Center for Resource Solutions.

“Without REST there would be no enforceable REC retirement obligation for regulated utilities,” Grimes said. “Utilities could sell RECs while also marketing the same electricity to customers as ‘renewable’ or ‘clean,’ creating significant risk of greenwashing.”

The public comments that were opposed included:

220 individual public comments from consumers

More than 150 petitions, with 369 signatures on Vote Solar’s petition alone

Dozens of companies and advocacy groups

Government entities and officials

APS was among only public comments explicitly in favor of the repeal. The investor-owned utility said many of its current contractual relationships that resulted from the mandate will still be in effect regardless of whether the standard is repealed. APS cited the payments it receives through rate riders, adjustors and renewable energy programs, authorized by many past commission orders, and said it will still be paid if the mandate is repealed.

Though Grand Canyon State Electric Cooperative Association (GCSECA) said it generally supports the repeal because the rule has burdensome filing requirements. However, it urged the commission to keep the current program, tariffs and surcharges in place and establish a replacement approval process.

The commission’s chair Kevin Thompson has ties to gas utilities, specifically in drumming up new business for gas and pipelines for the business. For over 12 years, he worked for Southwest Gas Corporation, where he was responsible for the gas company’s sale, design and installation of “billions of dollars of natural gas pipelines.”

APS has previously pointed to its ambitious goal for carbon-free electricity by 2050. The utility never made much progress beyond the state’s mandate, and the day before the commission’s decision to repeal the mandate, announced it was abandoning the goal. Instead, APS said it will aim for “carbon neutrality.”

That same day, APS announced a new gas project, which will involve a new transmission line to import gas. APS expects the imported gas will cost $7.3 billion over 25 years, APS parent company Pinnacle West said a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Laying out the regulated utility’s financial developments and outlook, Pinnacle West noted the several actions APS and the ACC took that either increased how much consumers pay to APS or decreased how much APS pays to others, including, but not limited to, multiple rate increases onto consumers, changes to rate designs to reduce “cross-subsidization by certain customer classes (currently ongoing) and so forth.

“None of this should surprise anyone,” Arizona’s Public Health Association said in a statement. “Voters put commissioners in office who openly favor fossil fuels over clean energy.”

Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes, who was on the ACC when it implemented REST in 2006, wrote a letter to the ACC, outlining the many implications that REST’s repeal would have on ratepayers. She noted the recent Lazard report that said utility-scale solar costs have fallen by 84% since 2009, and a Brattle report for PJM that found utility-scale solar and wind are cheaper to construct than new natural gas, coal and nuclear plants, and how relying on pipelines to important natural gas causes higher electric bills. She outlined the ACC’s failure to provide evidence in its statements that solar is more expensive than gas and increasing costs for its ratepayers, calling it “speculation at best.”

In a signal of a potential lawsuit to come, Mayes said, “In addition to being bad policy, repealing the REST Rules as proposed here is an unlawful abdication of the Commission’s duty to set just and reasonable rates,” she said.

“Ratemaking decisions must be just and reasonable, which means they must be supported by substantial evidence, not arbitrary, and lawfully made. The Commission’s decision must be based on high-quality evidence, not speculation and conjecture.”",https://pv-magazine-usa.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/26020715143_ab007849a4_5k-1200x800.jpg,N,,2025-08-22 22:00:21.574523

On 22 August 2025, Ørsted’s subsidiary Revolution Wind LLC, a 50/50 joint venture with Global Infrastructure Partner’s Skyborn Renewables, received an order instructing the project to stop activities on the outer continental shelf related to the Revolution Wind project from the US Department of the Interior’s Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM). Revolution Wind is complying with the order and is taking appropriate steps to stop offshore activities, ensuring the safety of workers and the environment.

The project commenced offshore construction following the final federal approval from BOEM last year. The project is 80% complete with all offshore foundations installed and 45 out of 65 wind turbines installed.

Ørsted is evaluating all options to resolve the matter expeditiously. This includes engagement with relevant permitting agencies for any necessary clarification or resolution as well as through potential legal proceedings, with the aim being to proceed with continued project construction towards COD in the second half of 2026.

Revolution Wind is fully permitted, having secured all required federal and state permits including its Construction and Operations Plan approval letter on 17 November 2023 following reviews that began more than nine years ago. Revolution Wind has 20-year power purchase agreements to deliver 400 MW of electricity to Rhode Island and 304 MW to Connecticut, enough to power over 350,000 homes across both states to meet their growing energy demand. As a reference, South Fork Wind, which is adjacent to Revolution Wind and uses the same turbine technology, delivered reliable energy to New York at a capacity factor of 53% for the first half of 2025, on par with the state’s baseload power sources.

Ørsted is investing into American energy generation, grid upgrades, port infrastructure, and a supply chain, including US shipbuilding and manufacturing extending to more than 40 states. Revolution Wind is already employing hundreds of local union workers supporting both on and offshore construction activities. Ørsted’s US offshore wind projects have totalled approximately 4 million labour union hours to date, 2 million of which are with Revolution Wind.

Ørsted is evaluating the potential financial implications of this development, considering a range of scenarios, including legal proceedings. Ørsted will, in due course, advise the market on the potential impact of the order on the plan announced on 11 August 2025 (company announcement 12/2025) to conduct a rights issue. Existing shareholders and prospective investors are advised to await further announcements by the company.

One of the larger fines, $194,772, was paid in 2019 after findings by the federal Environmental Protection Agency.

The explosion and fire at the plant forced an evacuation around the facility for a one-mile radius. Regulatory records show that there are at least 250 homes with 474 residents in that area as of a couple of years ago.

Smitty’s is listed as a “blending and packaging facility for oil and other engine lubricants.” The company’s website states that it stores, blends and distributes products from big name companies such as Penzoil, Quaker State, WD-40, Castrol, Armor All as well as its own brand, Super S.

Smitty’s website says the company was founded in 1969 by Edgar Ray Smith Jr. with his wife, George Ann, joining him three years later. The company says the couple’s four sons joined the business, and eventually purchased the business from their parents in 2000.

The Louisiana Secretary of State lists Edgar Smith as the company’s vice-president. Nobody from Smitty’s could be reached late Friday.

Hourly workers at the sprawling BlueOval SK Battery Park will vote on whether to join the United Auto Workers Union.
“It’s our time to sit across the table from management as equals,"" says one worker in a video produced by the United Auto Workers Union.
“A union safety committee can help sit down with the safety department to go over issues,"" Wilmoth said.
Ford and SK On announced Aug. 19 that its battery plant in West Tennessee was delaying production until 2027.","Election day is approaching for nearly 1,500 workers at an electric vehicle battery plant in Kentucky. Hourly workers at the sprawling BlueOval SK Battery Park will vote on whether to join the United Auto Workers Union.

The National Labor Relations Board has scheduled the secret ballot election for Aug. 26-27.

The election comes amid bitter tensions between workers and the company over safety and health issues.

Nearly a century ago, Ford Motor Company workers in Michigan pushed for safer factories. Today, their counterparts say they’re engaged in the same high stakes fight in Kentucky.

“It’s our time to sit across the table from management as equals,"" says one worker in a video produced by the United Auto Workers Union. “We want a legally binding contract that guarantees our wage, healthcare, PTO policies, and health and safety.”

Safety issues are 'not a joke'

For more than a year, the plant in Glendale, which is a partnership between Ford and South Korea-based SK On, has faced worker complaints over issues including mold, bat infestations, a lack of protective gear, fires, and exposure to dangerous chemicals.

Halee Hadfield works in quality control at BlueOval SK and is one of the workers raising concerns.

“There is enough chemical in this battery park to level all of Glendale and probably more than half of Elizabethtown,"" Hadfield told WKU Public Radio. ""That’s not a joke.”

Health and safety concerns have supercharged the union drive at the Hardin County campus that produces batteries for Ford and Lincoln EVs. At least a dozen worker complaints have been filed with Kentucky Occupational Safety and Health, according to an investigation by the Courier-Journal. Employees reported feeling unsafe working with toxic chemicals and claim there’s been a lack of proper training.

“A worker should have the ability to go to work and then come home and hug their family at the end of the day with two arms and ten fingers,"" said UAW Region 8 Director Tim Smith.

The union vote at Ford comes as another automaker, Hyundai, grapples with worker safety concerns at its battery megaplant in Georgia. Two workers have been killed this year at the facility and several have been injured in recent years.

As of last month, Blue Oval SK had only received one citation from Kentucky OSHA related to fire extinguishers.

""BlueOval SK is proud of our safety record. We constantly strive to improve and adapt our processes and procedures to remain on the leading edge of providing the safest environment possible for our team members,"" said Mark Hayley, Plant Manager of BlueOval's Kentucky 1 plant in Glendale. “Safety is a job that is never done. BlueOval SK maintains a full-time, on-site Safety and Emergency Response Team that operates 24/7 every day the plant is in operation. Safety is our foundation.""

Production operator Bill Wilmoth said workers' concerns have largely been dismissed by the company.

“A union safety committee can help sit down with the safety department to go over issues,"" Wilmoth said. ""Right now, it doesn’t matter if all of us walk in there together or we go one at a time, we don’t get anywhere.""

“Our team members are determined to produce best-in-class batteries,” Assistant Plant Manager Ben Gassman said in a statement. “The UAW will only hold our team back.”

After a supermajority of workers filed in favor of holding a union election in January, the company launched an anti-union campaign that relied heavily on digital advertising.

“Generally, these campaigns are quite effective"", said Professor Ariana Levinson who specializes in labor and employment law at the University of Louisville. ""That’s why employers are willing to spend lots of money on consultants to aid them with these campaigns.”

Were anti-union meetings mandatory or voluntary?

The company faces multiple allegations of unfair labor practices. The UAW alleges BlueOval SK has illegally fired workers for organizing, threatened to close the plant if it becomes unionized, and forced workers to attend captive audience meetings.

Production worker Joshua Urso said the company's ""coffee talks"" are often used to persuade workers to vote against unionization.

""The way it would work at first was, they would tell us some information and plans for the plant, and then at the end, they would throw in something like, 'Hey, vote no,'"" Urso told WKU Public Radio. ""It's definitely a captive audience. They'll tell you it's voluntary, but when it's time for a meeting, a supervisor will tell the whole area, 'Alright everybody, go to the meeting.'""

BlueOval SK declined interviews, but said in a statement that its team members have endured months of ""union sales tactics and slanders"" against their jobs, and are ready for their voices to be heard.

Currently, BlueOval SK is the only electic vehicle battery plant involving the Big Three automakers that is non-union. The UAW notched its first win at a battery plant in Ohio in 2022, followed by another in Tennessee in 2024, and one this year in Indiana.

“This is sort of a watershed moment for this burgeoning EV sector,"" said Eric Dixon, senior researcher at the Ohio River Valley Institute, a Louisville-based group advocating for solutions to environmental and energy issues facing Appalachia. “There’s also other benefits, ripple effects, that other workplaces in Kentucky could see because the plant is so large and it’s such a marquee economic development project for the state.”

The organizing success in Indiana, Ohio, and Tennessee, is part of the UAW's broader effort to unionize workers at EV battery plants across the country, including in Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina.

The UAW has had mixed success in recent years organizing in the South, a region where many states have right-to-work laws which forbid payment of union dues as a condition of getting or keeping a job.

The UAW lost an election this month at an auto manufacturer in Alabama after experiencing defeat at another plant in that state in 2024.

In 2024, only 8.8% wage and salary workers in Kentucky belonged to a union. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports union membership in the commonwealth was slightly below the national average of just 9.9%.

The Blue Oval SK election is happening in deep-red Hardin County, Kentucky, where 64% of voters in the 2024 election cast ballots for Donald Trump—someone who says he wants to stop the growth of the EV industry.

The makings of 'a historic election'

Voting begins Tuesday, Aug. 26, and the ballot counting will take place the following day after polls close Wednesday at 8 p.m.

If the UAW loses the vote, the National Labor Relations Board allows another election in one year. If the UAW vote is successful, Glendale workers will form their own local and begin working toward a contract.

""I think this is a historic election, not only for Kentucky, but our country and for manufacturing,"" said University of Louisville labor professor Ariana Levinson. ""The UAW had great gains after the Stand Up strike in 2023 and one of their goals was to organize the unorganized, and so I think this bears on the whole manufacturing industry, where we're going in the future.""

Meanwhile, the first electric battery rolled off the assembly line on Aug. 19 in Glendale and will power the all-electric Ford F-150 Lightning. The production launch came four years after Ford and SK On announced plans to build the nearly 1,500-acre campus. The $5.8 billion investment was designed as a twin-plant operation, but only one is currently online.

Roughly a quarter of the nation’s large cattle, dairy and hog farms are located in just 30 US counties, a new satellite-mapping study has found. The research also links large farms — whether in these dense hotspots or scattered elsewhere — to elevated air pollution.

The study supports concerns about the environmental impacts of factory livestock farms, which drive up air pollution levels by kicking up dust and ammonia in the massive amounts of manure onsite. It also comes on the heels of a federal ruling last week that supported exemptions for animal feeding operations from letting state and local officials know about “dangerous” pollutants, including air emissions.

The ruling sided with the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and industry farm groups in continuing an exemption under the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act, and tossed a lawsuit filed by environmental groups.

The environmental groups alleged that the EPA “acted arbitrarily and capriciously by failing to consider the public’s right to access information” when the agency determined animal waste air emissions no longer needed to be reported.

The new study, published in the peer-reviewed journal Communications Earth & Environment, is the first to nationally map out the size and location of these farms — called animal feeding operations or AFOs (defined as a livestock operation where animals are kept and fed for more than 45 days in a year) — and estimate their contribution to nearby PM2.5 emissions.

PM2.5 are tiny particulate air pollutants 30 times smaller than the width of a human hair and inhalation of them has been linked to asthma, heart and lung problems and preterm births.

“The meat you eat comes from somewhere. It takes up a lot of space and produces a lot of pollution,” Benjamin Goldstein, an assistant professor at the University of Michigan School for Environment and Sustainability and senior author of the new study, said in a statement. “And somebody else … has to bear that pollution.”

While experts say the new study is underestimating total AFOs, it adds to evidence that these large livestock operations — which, when large enough, are called concentrated animal feeding operations or CAFOs — are densely clustered in communities and fouling the air around them.

This study highlights “the inadequacy of existing pollution regulations … [and] demonstrates the urgent need for policy that limits the extreme concentration of concentrated animal feeding operations in rural communities,” Chris Hunt, deputy director of the Socially Responsible Agriculture Project (SRAP), said.

Clustered in certain states, counties

The researchers used existing federal and community data of AFOs and went through satellite data of every US county in the lower 48 states to locate the operations. Their totals are lower than federal estimates.

“We’re not claiming this includes every AFO in the US, but it’s a large enough sample to draw conclusions with confidence,” Dimitris Gounaridis, an assistant research scientist at the University of Michigan School for Environment and Sustainability and co-author of the new study, said in a statement.

Most of the cattle AFOs were in the Midwest and West, which together account for eight of the top 10 cattle AFO states. The top five states were California, Wisconsin, Nebraska, Idaho and Iowa.

This “demonstrates the urgent need for policy that limits the extreme concentration of concentrated animal feeding operations in rural communities.” – Chris Hunt, SRAP

Overall, just 21 counties have 26% of the total cattle AFO operations, and many counties are packed with these industrial farms.

“Five of the top ten counties (Tulare, Stanislaus, Merced, Kings in California, and Weld in Colorado) have more area dedicated to cattle AFOs than some of the top states,” the authors wrote.

A majority of hog AFOs were in the Midwest and South. The top five states were Iowa, North Carolina, Minnesota, Oklahoma and Missouri.

Just 28 US counties have 41% of the hog AFOs, and the top ten states account for 86% of the total operations in the US.

Dr. James A. Merchant, a professor emeritus at the University of Iowa departments of Occupational and Environmental Health and Internal Medicine, said the study is a useful sample of AFOs but “it is not clear if it is representative,” adding that the paper also doesn’t include large poultry farms, which are a potent source of ammonia and drive PM2.5 in AFO-dense areas.

But he said that “focusing on PM2.5 is the right environmental exposure.” The researchers found PM2.5 levels were roughly 28% higher near cattle feeding operations and 11% higher near hog operations compared to similar counties without AFOs. Large livestock farms drive up PM2.5 levels through ammonia in the massive amounts of manure and dust.

“It lingers in the air and can get really deep into your lungs and create scar tissue. It’s nasty stuff. There are really no safe levels of it,” Goldstein said.

In addition, an estimated 1.3 million people who do not have health insurance live within 10 miles of these cattle and hog AFOs.

“Industrial livestock operations have long been known to pose a serious threat to public health and the environment, causing pervasive — yet often overlooked — environmental injustice,” Hunt said.

Challenge to industrial farm air pollution shot down

Environmental groups have for years pushed for more air pollution regulation at AFOs — and last week that effort suffered a major blow. A federal judge shot down a lawsuit brought by Rural Empowerment Association for Community Help and nine other organizations, which were pushing for the EPA to mandate air emissions reporting from animal feeding operations. “Emissions generated from animal waste at CAFOs are highly toxic and are sickening communities across the country,” the original lawsuit stated.

“It lingers in the air and can get really deep into your lungs and create scar tissue. It’s nasty stuff. There are really no safe levels of it.” – Benjamin Goldstein, University of Michigan

US District Judge Timothy Kelly last week, however, wrote that Congress exempted air pollution from animal waste from needing an EPA notification under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA).",https://sentientmedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Story-Images-2-41.png,N,,2025-08-23 02:59:44.194730

The Chinese lithium market has experienced unprecedented turbulence in recent months, drawing global attention as prices swing dramatically amid supply uncertainties and speculative trading. With lithium being a critical component in electric vehicle batteries, these market dynamics have far-reaching implications for the global lithium market and EV manufacturing sector.

What's Driving Chinese Lithium Trading Volatility?

Chinese lithium trading has reached extraordinary levels of activity and volatility, creating both opportunities and challenges for market participants. The combination of supply constraints, regulatory shifts, and speculative interest has created perfect conditions for extreme price movements.

Record-Breaking Trading Activity

The Guangzhou Futures Exchange witnessed its busiest period in July 2025 since the lithium contract launched in 2023. Trading volumes surged to all-time highs as market participants rushed to take positions amid uncertainty about future supply conditions. According to Bloomberg News, open interest—the number of outstanding bets on prices—also reached record levels, with this momentum continuing well into August.

Daily price swings have frequently hit exchange-imposed limits, triggering a series of regulatory interventions designed to cool the market. The exchange has been forced to implement multiple measures to control what many observers consider excessive speculation.

Price Fluctuations Reach Extreme Levels

Price movements in recent months illustrate the extraordinary volatility gripping the market:

Prices surpassed ¥80,000 ($11,135) per ton in July before retreating to ¥67,840 by month-end

August witnessed a dramatic 30% price surge to over ¥90,000 before moderating to 21% monthly gains

Price fluctuations frequently triggered daily limit mechanisms

In response to these wild swings, the Guangzhou Exchange implemented three separate control measures in July alone, including position caps, trading fee adjustments, and stricter enforcement of price limit mechanisms. These interventions reflect growing concern about market stability and the potential for disruptive speculation.

""Chinese commodity exchanges have a very high share of participation from speculative or individual investors—much higher than commodity exchanges outside of China—which can lead to greater volatility on a daily basis,"" noted Przemek Koralewski, global head of market development at Fastmarkets.

Why Is the Yichun Supply Situation Creating Market Uncertainty?

Supply disruptions in China's key lithium production regions have become a critical factor driving market volatility, with regulatory developments creating particular uncertainty about future production capacity.

Production Disruptions in China's Lithium Hub

In early August 2025, battery manufacturing giant Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Ltd. (CATL) halted operations at a major mining facility in Yichun after failing to renew its mining permit. This shutdown sent shockwaves through the market, as the Yichun region in Jiangxi province represents one of China's most significant lithium production centers.

The suddenness of the closure caught many market participants by surprise, particularly given CATL's prominence in the battery supply chain. The company's mining operations in Yichun have been a substantial contributor to domestic lithium supply, making the permit renewal failure particularly significant for market sentiment.

Regulatory Environment Tightening

The CATL mine closure has triggered broader concerns about Beijing's approach to lithium mining oversight. Market analysts note that this development suggests a potential tightening of regulatory scrutiny across the sector, with possible implications for other nearby projects.

This regulatory uncertainty has created a battleground between market bulls, who see supply constraints supporting higher prices, and bears, who believe current price levels are unsustainable given the longer-term supply outlook. The situation remains fluid, with market participants closely monitoring regulatory signals for indications of future policy direction.

Several factors have contributed to this heightened regulatory focus:

Environmental impact concerns from rapid mining expansion

Safety standards enforcement after several widely-reported incidents

Quality control issues affecting downstream battery production

Resource conservation priorities from central planning authorities

How Does China's Financial Market Environment Impact Lithium Trading?

The lithium market doesn't exist in isolation—broader trends in Chinese financial markets have significantly influenced trading patterns and investor behavior in the lithium futures space.

The ""Anti-Involution"" Effect

A notable phenomenon known as ""anti-involution"" has swept through Chinese financial markets in recent months, influencing trading patterns across multiple asset classes including lithium futures. This concept—which broadly refers to resistance against diminishing returns despite increased effort—has manifested in market behavior characterized by heightened speculation and contrarian positioning.

According to Bloomberg News, this theme has contributed to the spike in futures activity for lithium, with traders increasingly willing to take speculative positions based on short-term supply concerns rather than long-term fundamentals. The result has been amplified price movements that sometimes appear disconnected from physical market conditions.

Individual investors represent a significantly higher percentage of participants compared to non-Chinese exchanges, creating a market dynamic more susceptible to sentiment shifts and momentum trading. This composition contrast helps explain why price volatility on the Guangzhou Exchange often exceeds what's observed in physical lithium markets.

Exchange Intervention Measures

The Guangzhou Futures Exchange has responded to excessive volatility with multiple regulatory tools:

Position caps limiting the size of new positions traders can establish

Trading fee adjustments designed to discourage speculative activity

Price limit mechanisms that halt trading when daily moves exceed predetermined thresholds

These interventions highlight the delicate balance exchange operators must maintain between allowing price discovery and preventing disruptive market behavior. Despite these measures, price volatility has remained elevated, suggesting the underlying supply concerns and speculative interest continue to dominate market sentiment.

What Makes the Guangzhou Futures Exchange Unique for Lithium Trading?

The Guangzhou Futures Exchange has quickly established itself as the global focal point for lithium price discovery, though its structure and participant composition create distinctive market dynamics.

Market Composition and Behavior

A defining characteristic of the Guangzhou Exchange is its high proportion of speculative and individual investors compared to international commodity exchanges. This participant mix contributes to several observable market behaviors:

Greater daily price volatility than physical lithium markets

More pronounced reaction to news events and supply disruptions

Higher trading volumes relative to physical delivery

Frequent testing of daily price limits

Market experts note that this composition creates both opportunities and challenges. While the enhanced liquidity benefits all market participants, the increased volatility can complicate risk management for commercial users attempting to hedge physical positions.

Contract Specifications and Influence

The Guangzhou Exchange specializes in lithium carbonate futures, trading a refined form of lithium used directly in EV battery production. This specificity makes the contract particularly relevant for battery manufacturers and EV producers looking to manage input cost risk.

""Guangzhou's exchange undoubtedly has a role in how the lithium market transacts,"" noted market development expert Koralewski. ""Ultimately, it's in the discretion of market participants to decide if they want to be exposed to it.""

The exchange has become increasingly influential in global lithium price formation despite its volatility, with pricing from Guangzhou futures contracts often referenced in physical supply contracts and market analysis. This influence has grown as China continues to dominate both lithium processing and EV battery manufacturing.

What's the Outlook for Chinese Lithium Markets?

Market participants and analysts remain divided on the longer-term outlook for Chinese lithium markets, though most expect the current extreme volatility to eventually moderate.

Short-Term Volatility Expectations

Analysts broadly expect elevated price volatility to persist in the near term. According to Citigroup analysts cited by Bloomberg News, the market's ""current sensitivity to policy uncertainty around supply cuts and related news flow"" will likely keep price volatility elevated during the next couple of months.

Several factors contribute to this volatility outlook:

Ongoing uncertainty about regulatory decisions affecting mining permits

Potential for additional production disruptions in key regions

Continued speculative interest from retail investors

Seasonality in demand patterns from battery manufacturers

Market sensitivity to supply-related news remains exceptionally high, with even minor developments capable of triggering significant price movements. This creates challenging conditions for commercial users attempting to manage procurement strategies.

Supply-Demand Balance Projections

The current modest domestic supply deficit is widely expected to reverse in coming months as production normalizes and new capacity comes online. Industry experts anticipate:

Production resumption at several temporarily idled facilities

Gradual regulatory clarity improving operational certainty

New extraction technologies improving recovery rates

Continued investment in processing capacity expansion

Most analysts view the recent price surge as temporary rather than signaling a fundamental shift in market dynamics. The longer-term outlook suggests a return to the structural oversupply conditions that characterized the market before recent disruptions, though the timeline for this transition remains uncertain.

Disclaimer: The lithium market is subject to significant volatility and uncertainty. The projections discussed represent current analyst expectations but may not accurately predict future market conditions. Investors should conduct thorough research before making investment decisions based on market forecasts.

How Does This Volatility Impact the Global EV Supply Chain?

The ripple effects from Chinese lithium trading spikes amid volatility and supply concerns extend throughout the global electric vehicle supply chain, creating challenges for manufacturers, suppliers, and investors.

Battery Manufacturing Implications

For battery manufacturers, price uncertainty complicates critical business processes:

Procurement strategies must account for potential dramatic price shifts

Contract negotiations increasingly include flexibility mechanisms

Inventory management becomes more complex amid price volatility

Margin protection requires sophisticated hedging approaches

EV producers face parallel challenges in cost forecasting and pricing strategies. The unpredictability of key input costs makes financial planning more difficult, particularly for manufacturers with longer production cycles or fixed-price sales contracts.

Increasingly, supply chain participants are implementing risk management strategies designed specifically for volatile lithium markets. These include:

Geographic diversification of supply sources

Vertical integration through mining investments

Development of technical alternatives reducing lithium dependency

Implementation of sophisticated financial hedging programs

Investment Considerations

For investors and financial market participants, Chinese lithium market volatility presents both opportunities and risks. Market positioning increasingly requires:

Careful assessment of appropriate exposure levels to Chinese lithium futures

Trading strategies focused on volatility rather than directional price moves

Enhanced risk management protocols given extreme price movements

Deeper understanding of physical market fundamentals

Physical market participants face growing pressure to implement hedging strategies that protect against adverse price movements. This has driven increased interest in options and other derivative instruments that can provide downside protection while maintaining upside potential.

FAQs About Chinese Lithium Trading

Why has lithium trading in China become so volatile?

The combination of supply uncertainty in the Yichun region, regulatory changes, and high speculative trading participation has created perfect conditions for extreme price volatility. The shutdown of a major CATL mine due to permit issues has particularly fueled market uncertainty, while the ""anti-involution"" theme in Chinese financial markets has attracted speculative interest beyond typical commodity market participants.

How does Chinese lithium trading compare to other commodity markets?

Chinese commodity exchanges typically have much higher participation from individual and speculative investors compared to international exchanges. According to market experts, this participant composition leads to greater price volatility and more frequent extreme price movements. The lithium market has been especially susceptible to these dynamics given its strategic importance in China's electric vehicle manufacturing ecosystem.

What measures has the Guangzhou Futures Exchange taken to control volatility?

The exchange has implemented multiple interventions, including position caps limiting new positions, adjustments to trading fees, and price limit mechanisms that trigger when daily moves exceed certain thresholds. Despite these measures, volatility has remained elevated, suggesting the underlying supply concerns and speculative interest continue to dominate market sentiment.

Will lithium prices continue rising through 2025?

Most analysts predict the recent price surge will be short-lived. As mines resume production and regulatory clarity improves, the current modest supply deficit is expected to flip to oversupply, likely moderating prices in the coming months. However, the timing and extent of this correction remain subject to significant uncertainty, particularly given the potential for additional regulatory developments affecting production capacity.

How should businesses in the EV supply chain manage lithium price volatility?

Companies throughout the EV supply chain are increasingly implementing comprehensive risk management strategies, including:

Diversifying supply sources across multiple regions

Developing more flexible procurement contracts

Maintaining strategic inventory buffers

Implementing financial hedging programs

Investing in R&D for lithium industry innovations

Exploring vertical integration opportunities

The effectiveness of these approaches varies based on each company's position in the supply chain, financial resources, and risk tolerance.

What role does speculation play in the Chinese lithium market?

Speculation has become a significant factor in Chinese lithium futures trading, with individual investors representing a much larger proportion of market activity than in most international commodity exchanges. This speculative interest amplifies price movements and can sometimes create disconnects between futures prices and physical market fundamentals. However, the resulting liquidity also supports more efficient price discovery and risk transfer functions for companies interested in battery metals investment and critical minerals energy security.

With ongoing research into battery recycling breakthrough technologies, the industry hopes to reduce some of the supply pressures currently amplifying market volatility.

In addition to tax credit concerns, tariffs loom large over the market.
On a more positive note, the used EV market shows encouraging developments.
Many of these vehicles also qualify for the $4,000 used-EV tax credit, which is set to expire alongside the new credit at the end of this month.","The latest report from Cars.com sheds light on the electric vehicle (EV) market, revealing a mix of optimism and concern as new vehicle sales surged 6.6% year-over-year in July. This increase comes despite a notable first decline in dealer inventory since 2022, as consumers rushed to take advantage of deals ahead of impending tariffs and the expiration of EV tax credits.

The immediate incentive for buyers appears to stem from a pressing “buy now” mentality. Shoppers are eager to secure purchases before the federal $7,500 tax credit expires on September 30. Although consumers now have more choices than ever, with 75 different EV models available — a 27% increase from last year — the growth in new EV inventory has slowed considerably to only 9% year-over-year. This marks the lowest growth rate since before the Inflation Reduction Act revived federal incentives. Industry analysts predict that the impending loss of tax benefits could lead to a spike in purchases, though subsequent price increases might temper demand, especially since most new EVs fall within the premium-to-luxury price range.

In addition to tax credit concerns, tariffs loom large over the market. Automakers are currently facing an estimated $12 billion in tariff-related costs in the second quarter alone, which they have absorbed to maintain sticker prices. This approach, however, is becoming increasingly unsustainable. Forecasts indicate that if current 25% tariffs remain in place, the average new vehicle price could rise from $48,000 to approximately $54,400 — an increase of around $6,400. Even if trade agreements manage to reduce tariffs to 15%, buyers would still face an average price hike of over $4,000, a significant challenge considering that household incomes grew by only 1% last year.

On a more positive note, the used EV market shows encouraging developments. Year-over-year inventory has increased by 33%, and the average prices for used EVs have dipped by 2%, settling at $36,000. In particular, affordable used EVs priced under $25,000, such as the Tesla Model 3, Nissan Leaf, and Chevy Bolt EV, are selling 20% faster than average. Many of these vehicles also qualify for the $4,000 used-EV tax credit, which is set to expire alongside the new credit at the end of this month.

The EV landscape thus presents a complex picture of growth and impending challenges, as consumers scramble to secure favorable deals before significant price increases due to tariffs take effect. The market’s future will largely depend on policy shifts and consumer responses in the wake of these changes.",https://news.ssbcrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/July-EV-Sales-Show-Growth-Amid-Tariff-and-Tax-Credit.jpeg,N,,2025-08-22 21:04:44.732691

A Compelling Near-Term Investment For investors, enCore's capital raise represents a rare alignment of strategic execution and market opportunity.
Conclusion enCore Energy Corp's $115 million convertible notes offering is more than a financing event—it is a strategic masterstroke that positions the company to lead the uranium sector's green energy transition.
By securing long-term capital, reducing debt, and investing in scalable projects, enCore has created a robust foundation for growth.
As the world pivots toward clean energy, enCore's uranium projects are not just a part of the solution—they are a catalyst for it.","In a bold move to capitalize on the global energy transition, enCore Energy Corp has executed a $115 million upsized offering of 5.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2030, signaling robust investor confidence and positioning the company for accelerated growth in the uranium sector. This strategic capital raise not only strengthens enCore's balance sheet but also aligns with the rising demand for nuclear energy as a clean, reliable power source. For investors, the offering represents a compelling opportunity to back a company poised to benefit from both market tailwinds and operational innovation.

A Capital Structure Designed for Growth and Flexibility

The convertible notes, initially priced at $100 million, were upsized by $15 million after underwriters fully exercised their over-allotment option—a clear vote of confidence in enCore's prospects. The 5.50% coupon rate, combined with a 2030 maturity date, provides the company with a stable, long-term funding source at a time when interest rates are trending upward. This structure avoids the refinancing risks that plague many capital-intensive industries, ensuring enCore can focus on execution rather than short-term liquidity constraints.

The conversion price of $3.2895 per share—a 27.5% premium to the stock's August 19 closing price of $2.58—further underscores the offering's shareholder-friendly design. By setting a price floor, enCore limits immediate dilution while incentivizing growth through upside potential. Additionally, $11.5 million of the proceeds was allocated to capped call transactions, effectively establishing a $4.52/share price floor (a 75% premium to the August 2025 price). This move signals management's commitment to protecting existing shareholders, a critical factor in attracting long-term capital.

Fueling Green Energy Projects with Strategic Capital

The $87.7 million in remaining net proceeds will directly fund enCore's expansion of U.S. uranium projects, including the Alta Mesa Uranium Project in South Texas and the newly acquired Tacubaya land parcel. These initiatives are central to the company's mission to supply low-cost, clean nuclear fuel. The Alta Mesa project, operating under a 70/30 joint venture with Boss Energy Ltd, has already reduced production costs from $100.71 to $59.42 per pound in 2025 through In-Situ Recovery (ISR) technology. With plans to add 75 new wells and increase drill rigs from 24 to 30 by Q3 2025, enCore is primed to scale production while maintaining environmental sustainability.

The Tacubaya acquisition, a 5,900-acre parcel adjacent to Alta Mesa, further extends the project's longevity. Historical drilling data from Chevron Minerals in the 1970s revealed multiple uranium roll fronts, which enCore plans to explore aggressively starting in October 2025. This expansion not only diversifies enCore's asset base but also aligns with U.S. government priorities to reduce reliance on foreign uranium imports. The $1.2 billion federal investment in domestic uranium production, coupled with streamlined regulatory approvals and tax credits for nuclear projects, creates a favorable operating environment for enCore's green energy initiatives.

Shareholder Value and Investor Confidence

The capital raise also addresses near-term debt obligations, with $10.6 million used to repay existing loans. This reduces leverage and improves cash flow flexibility, allowing enCore to allocate resources to high-impact projects. The company's strategic use of convertible debt—rather than dilutive equity—demonstrates a disciplined approach to capital management. By prioritizing debt reduction and capped call transactions, enCore has signaled its intent to balance growth with shareholder protection.

Investor confidence is further reinforced by the underwriting team's involvement. Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. and Haywood Securities Inc. executed a seamless offering, while legal advisors like Sidley Austin and Winston & Strawn ensured compliance with complex securities regulations. The fact that the convertible notes are not registered in the U.S. or Canada until specific dates also minimizes short-term market volatility, allowing enCore to focus on long-term value creation.

A Compelling Near-Term Investment

For investors, enCore's capital raise represents a rare alignment of strategic execution and market opportunity. The company is leveraging low-cost financing to expand its uranium production capabilities at a time when global demand for nuclear energy is surging. With uranium prices supported by decarbonization goals and geopolitical shifts, enCore's position as a U.S.-based, low-cost producer offers significant upside.

The stock's recent performance——reflects growing investor optimism, but the 27.5% conversion premium in the notes suggests there is still room for appreciation. As enCore scales production at Alta Mesa and advances projects in South Dakota and Wyoming, the company is well-positioned to outperform peers in a sector poised for long-term growth.

Conclusion

enCore Energy Corp's $115 million convertible notes offering is more than a financing event—it is a strategic masterstroke that positions the company to lead the uranium sector's green energy transition. By securing long-term capital, reducing debt, and investing in scalable projects, enCore has created a robust foundation for growth. For investors seeking exposure to a company that combines operational excellence with environmental stewardship, enCore offers a compelling near-term opportunity.

Why we are consulting

Delivering clean power by 2030 is at the heart of our mission to transform the UK into a clean energy superpower. Reflecting the urgency of the challenge, the Government has taken early action to deliver this goal including ending the onshore wind ban and establishing GB Energy. The CfD is vital in securing the renewables deployment necessary to deliver clean power by 2030, and the Clean Industry Bonus (CIB) has been introduced to support that deployment with the development of more sustainable offshore and floating offshore wind supply chains.

The response to the CIB in AR7 was strong, with £544 million allocated to support the supply chain. Subject to the Contracts for Difference process, this could leverage up to £9 billion in private investment in cleaner manufacturers, new and upgraded factories, and port infrastructure. We committed to building on the early success of the CIB in the ‘Clean Energy Industries Sector Plan’ under ‘The UK’s Modern Industrial Strategy’, and this consultation invites views on proposed changes to deliver that commitment.

The proposed changes include addressing operational issues identified in AR7, introducing new criteria on workforce protection and skills development, and extending the CIB to onshore wind, as per the manifesto commitment. Together, these changes aim to enhance the CIB’s effectiveness in supporting the clean energy superpower mission, help to develop supply chains that are more environmentally sustainable and deliver economic and social value to the regions that need it most.

Scope of this consultation

The consultation seeks views on proposed regulatory changes to the CIB in support of the aims outlined above. Specifically, we are considering:

Introducing a new criterion aimed at improving minimum levels of workforce protection by encouraging developers and suppliers to commit to discussions on a new offshore wind fair work charter, which will help ensure offshore wind developers and their supply chains offer good jobs, terms and conditions.

Introducing a new criterion aimed at improving minimum investment in skills, encouraging developers to invest either through a pooled fund targeting industry-wide needs or through project-level initiatives, to help build the skilled workforce needed to support the clean energy transition. Though this does not necessitate regulatory change, we are consulting due to the implications for both the CIB criteria and minimum standards.

Expanding the CIB to include onshore wind, recognising its vital role in delivering clean power and the opportunity to support investments in cleaner and shorter supply chains.

Rectifying minor issues from the initial implementation of the CIB in AR7. While the first round of the CIB was successful, we recognise the need to amend some of the processes and refine the scheme so it runs as smoothly as possible for government, developers and the supply chain.

To note, other non-regulatory matters will result in amendments to the CIB Allocation Framework. These will be tested with industry, trade bodies, unions and other relevant stakeholders during the summer.

Clean Industry Bonus scheme description

The Clean Industry Bonus (CIBs) is part of the Contracts for Difference scheme, which is the government’s main mechanism to support the deployment of new low-carbon electricity generation projects in Great Britain.

The Clean Industry Bonus rewards fixed and floating offshore wind developers who choose to invest in cleaner and more sustainable supply chains. The scheme does this by covering the difference in cost between more expensive but more desirable supply chain investments, compared to cheaper but less desirable investments. This is in effect the difference in cost between investing in cleaner or more sustainable facilities, or in a facility (e.g. blades, cables, ports) in a deprived UK area, versus dirtier or less sustainable facilities. By offering extra CfD revenue support for supply chain improvements, the CIB ensures that the “lowest price wins” aspects of the CfD does not inhibit the supply chain investments we need to support our renewables deployment targets and reduce our reliance on polluting suppliers.

The scheme currently features two sustainable criteria. An applicant may be considered to have met Criterion 1, ‘Investment in shorter supply chains’, if an investment is made in an offshore or floating offshore wind manufacturing facility, installation firm, or port located in a UK deprived area. An applicant may be considered to have met Criterion 2, ‘Investment in cleaner supply chains’, if an investment is made in offshore or floating offshore manufacturing facilities or installation firms owned or operated by firms that can evidence having set or committed to a Science Based Target.

To be able to enter a CfD auction, and to apply for extra funding through the CIB, an applicant must have met the CIB ‘minimum standard’ of investment in supply chain sustainability. Currently, this CIB Minimum Standard is for an applicant to have invested at least £100m per GW for fixed-bottom offshore wind farm or £50m per GW for a floating offshore wind farm into facilities meeting the CIB criteria. Once an applicant has met the minimum standard, they can apply for additional revenue support through a competitive process if they choose to invest further under either of these two criteria.

Projects awarded a Clean Industry Bonus will have their commitment written into their CfD contract to ensure delivery. Projects will be monitored at least twice a year to follow progress on delivery. Projects that do not deliver investments will not be paid the Bonus. Partial delivery will only be paid a portion of the CIB equivalent to the portion of their investment delivered. Failure to deliver the minimum standard will incur a corresponding penalty on a developer’s CfD payment.

Proposed reforms to the Clean Industry Bonus

Workforce protection

Clean energy jobs represent the skilled, high-quality employment opportunities of the future, potentially offering good wages, stability, and the chance to build a varied and fulfilling career. These jobs are essential for boosting productivity and driving economic growth. However, there are persistent concerns about workplace standards across parts of the sector, challenges around workforce diversity and wider social inclusion, and there is a mixed picture on trade union access and recognition.

We estimate the offshore wind sector could support up to 100,000 direct and indirect jobs in Great Britain by 2030 . The CIB can play a role in ensuring that high-quality jobs are provided as a minimum, strengthening workforce protections by helping to improve the environment around pay, terms, and conditions. This will support the economic and social sustainability of offshore wind supply chains, encouraging companies that offer good jobs in the communities that need them most. Any CIB measure on workforce protection would be delivered either through CIB minimum standards (i.e. CfD entry requirements) or as a condition to receiving bonuses. The government does not believe that the CIB should offer additional ‘bonuses’ (i.e. more subsidy) for such interventions, as high quality jobs should be provided as a minimum by businesses and bonuses would be difficult to quantify in a way that provides good value for money. Strengthening workforce protection in offshore wind through the CIB may necessitate an addition to regulation 6(2B) of The Contracts for Difference (Allocation) Regulations 2014.

Encouraging commitment to discussions on a new offshore wind fair work charter through the CIB

The government’s lead proposal for AR8 is to encourage commitment, through the CIB, to discussions on a new and ambitious offshore wind fair work charter that is co-developed between the offshore wind industry and trade unions, with government playing a convening role. Various local and devolved authorities across the UK have sought to develop such charters and the government encourages businesses to sign-up where they exist, especially in sectors or areas in receipt of government support, for example in Industrial Strategy Zones.

The development of a new offshore wind fair work charter presents an opportunity for government, industry, and trade unions to build a shared consensus on key issues such as pay, terms, and conditions. We expect an offshore wind fair work charter could include, but would not necessarily be limited to, commitments on pay, job security, health and safety, access to trade unions, and employee wellbeing.

We recognise that we cannot encourage sign-up to a full and ambitious fair work charter in time for AR8, as the lead-in times to negotiate the commitments are not compatible with our desire to publish a draft CIB Allocation Framework in the Autumn. To generate momentum in AR8, we would require commitment to participating in discussions on a fair work charter which would provide a first step towards full implementation of the charter in AR9. Incentivising commitment to discussions on a fair work charter through the CIB in AR8 could help focus industry and trade union collaboration, with the aim of building consensus around a set of meaningful minimum commitments that target some of the remaining challenges on workforce protection in offshore wind. Encouraging discussions on the development of a fair work charter will form part of DESNZ’s Clean Energy Workforce Strategy, to be published in the coming months, and it will reiterate the government’s commitment to exploring how we can encourage fair work through the CIB.

The measures we propose for AR8 are three-fold. First, either CIB minimum standards or bonus eligibility requirements would encourage commitment from developers to discussions on a fair work charter. Second, suppliers could be encouraged to commit to discussions on a fair work charter by making this a condition of their eligibility to be included in CIB investments. These commitments to discussions from developers and suppliers could be either a public commitment, a commitment made as part of CIB minimum standards or eligibility rules, or both. Third, the government would commit to convening widespread representation of all key interests in the discussions, beginning this summer. This would include representation from a range of supply chain firms, along with both offshore wind and floating offshore wind developers and relevant trade unions and workers’ representatives.

This approach to AR8 could provide a genuine step towards implementation of a fair work charter in AR9 that offers commitment to the process from both government and industry. Importantly, it would avoid introducing one-off requirements for AR8 that may distract from, or undermine, discussions on the fair work charter. We could also consider incentivising sign-up to suitable early commitments if agreed by relevant parties prior to Autumn, which could then be reflected in the AR8 CIB Allocation Framework ahead of publication (subject to their design). Once a full fair work charter has been established, we could consider incentivising sign-up via the CIB in AR9, which would provide all parties with sufficient time to engage in meaningful discussions on its design. The government will review the contents of the charter before considering whether and how to incentivise sign-up to the full range of commitments.

Options to incentivise developers to participate in fair work charter discussions

We are considering two options to incentivise developers to participate in discussions on a fair work charter in AR8. These are set out below.

Option one is to require developers to commit to discussions on the fair work charter as part of their CIB minimum standards and to sign up to suitable early commitments if agreed by all relevant parties prior to Autumn through a public commitment. This would require all developers to commit to discussions and any early commitments agreed, with an accompanying financial non-delivery disincentive should they not subsequently participate actively in the discussions and/or subsequently not meet any early commitments agreed. The minimum standard amount (i.e. the financial liability) for developers could be increased, with performance related adjustments applied proportionately for non-delivery. This would align closely with the existing design of the CIB, but we recognise the challenge in determining an appropriate minimum standard amount reflective of commitment to a fair work charter.

Option two is to make developers’ eligibility to apply for CIB bonuses conditional on their public commitment to discussions on the charter and any early commitments agreed. Upon application, there would be no financial non-delivery disincentive put in place for those developers that did not wish to commit, but they would not be able to apply for bonuses. If, however, a developer was to receive a CIB bonus but later withdrew their commitment to the discussions or any early commitments agreed, they would be denied their bonus payment as they would no longer meet the eligibility requirements. This option would avoid an increase to the minimum standard amount, but risks a negative impact on investment made through the CIB.

Options to incentivise suppliers to participate in fair work charter discussions

With regard to suppliers, we are also considering two options to encourage commitment to discussions on, and the principle of, a fair work charter. These are set out below.

Option one is that, to be eligible to be included in a developer’s CIB investment proposal under criterion 1, we could require some or all supply chain firms to make a public commitment to discussions and early commitments agreed on the fair work charter. To minimise resource and cost burdens, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) – and / or firms with smaller contract values - could be exempted, though we would strongly encourage firms to commit to discussions on the charter where possible. New facilities may also be exempt from committing to discussions in acknowledgement they would face additional challenges to participation. This option has been designed to encourage commitment and sign-up to the charter across the supply chain, without increasing costs or burden for SMEs or new facilities. Again, we recognise new eligibility conditions may risk a negative impact on investment made through the CIB.

Alternatively, option two focuses on suppliers’ eligibility to receive Industrial Growth Plan (IGP) funding via the CIB. Currently, suppliers can receive IGP funding from developers’ contributions to the IGP Delivery Body (a role assumed by the Offshore Wind Growth Partnership as part of their CIB minimum standard obligations. Under option two, suppliers would only be eligible for this funding if they commit publicly to discussions on the fair work charter. However, suppliers who do not make this commitment would still be eligible to be included in CIB investments. While this may lead to less commitment to developing a fair work charter compared to option 1, it could have less impact on investments made through the CIB.

As set out above, ahead of AR9, the government could consider requiring sign-up to a full fair work charter subject to the result of the discussions and the commitments included. As part of its considerations, the government could utilise a tiered approach to sign-up across the supply chain as an eligibility condition to being included in CIB investments under criterion 1 or via the IGP. In practice, this could mean that the largest firms are expected to sign-up to implementing the charter in its entirety and less-large firms expected to sign-up to the majority of the charter but not every aspect. SMEs – and / or firms with smaller contract values - may not be required to sign-up while new facilities could be provided with more time to sign-up.

Skills

The government is committed to driving an increase in the capacity of our domestic clean energy workforce to match the scale of clean energy deployment, and to ensure the UK has the skills needed to deliver the Clean Energy Mission.

The Office for Clean Energy Jobs ‘Assessment of the clean energy skills challenge’ , as part of the ‘Clean Power 2030 Action Plan’, provided a basis for government to better understand the 2030 workforce requirements and support targeted skills planning. It pointed to common challenges that cut across clean energy sectors, including competition for skills, awareness of opportunities, equality and diversity, an ageing and retiring workforce, and barriers to training. Despite the scale of the skills needs, there has been a steady decline in employer investment in training over the last decade, with real terms investment per employee down 19% since 2011.

The government aims to create the right conditions and incentives for industry to invest in current and future skills requirements. Previously, the government requested developers to submit, for approval, Supply Chain Plans (SCPs) to be eligible to enter a CfD Allocation Round. These SCPs included a requirement for developers to give an overview of the skills commitments they were making to meet the aims and objectives of the Supply Chain Plan Policy.

Encouraging investment in skills through the CIB

As set out in the ‘Industrial Strategy: Clean Energy Industries Sector Plan’ , the government is now considering introducing a skills criterion into the CIB for AR8, which could help accelerate investments in skills as part of wider government efforts to meet our 2030 targets. We recognise the work that many industry players already do on skills throughout the project lifecycle, including through community benefit funds, but we see a gap for the CIB to set some minimum requirements in this space given the scale of the clean energy superpower mission. The aim is that such requirements would complement rather than displace the offshore wind industry’s existing skills investments.

We see two alternative ways of introducing a skills criterion into the CIB, which we would like to test through this consultation. Both would form part of CIB minimum standards rather than offering CIB bonuses as we consider that investment in future capability should be provided as a minimum and bonuses would be difficult to quantify.

Option 1: Developers could be incentivised to contribute towards a “skills investment fund” that encourages a more collaborative approach.

Option 2: Developers could be incentivised to invest in skills at the project level.

Option 1 – Incentivise contributions to a “skills investment fund”

In this option, the CIB would incentivise contributions from developers to a “skills investment fund”, to be administered and operated by a third-party. This could enable industry, with government partnership, to channel investment to where it is needed most and in ways that individual projects cannot manage alone. The government recognises the challenge to establish a GB-wide skills investment fund given the importance of regional and local interventions and note that education and skills policy is devolved to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.

We engaged with stakeholders ahead of this consultation to examine how CIBs could be used to help address skills challenges in the sector. Our early engagement suggested that the CIB could be used as a mechanism to incentivise a more collaborative approach to skills investment. Such an approach would allow for interventions that target industry-level challenges, with the potential to align interventions with wider government skills policy as well as the ‘Offshore Wind Industry Council People and Skills Plan 2024’ . There is also an opportunity for a skills investment fund to support engagement with under-represented groups in the sector, which could help promote social mobility and attract a broader talent pool. Promoting industry leadership in this space, with government playing a convening role, could help to stimulate coordinated skills interventions that complement existing activities, avoid duplication and maximise impact.

The government recognises the challenge to establish a GB-wide skills investment fund given the importance of national, regional and local interventions, and it is essential that any such fund delivers for offshore wind projects and workers across GB. In recognition that skills is a devolved matter, we would continue to engage with the Scottish and Welsh governments to ensure they can input into the distribution of funds. We would aim to align with current and future strategy, including the upcoming ‘Offshore wind skills action plan’ which is being jointly developed by the Scottish Government, industry, public sector delivery partners and trade unions. The government would also continue to engage with industry to ensure that a skills investment fund complements – rather than replaces – developers’ ongoing work at the regional and local levels.

The IGP Delivery Body could be well-placed to administer a skills investment fund, particularly given the existing link with the CIB and its remit to make strategic, targeted investments. Currently, developers can choose to contribute part of their CIB minimum standard amount to the IGP Delivery Body, as long as it is used to support investments that meet the CIB criteria. In AR8, to cover the costs of a skills investment fund and to provide a level playing field among developers, the CIB could require that a proportion of developers’ minimum standard contributions are put towards the IGP Delivery Body. Alternatively, the voluntary approach could continue. If the IGP Delivery Body is responsible for administering both the skills and supply chain contributions, the amount of funding reserved for skills could either be decided by the strategy function of the Body itself, or the government could require that a minimum amount of funding is reserved for skills.

In terms of distributing funds, the CIB Allocation Framework would set guidance in relation to eligible investments that a skills investment fund could target. The government would look to engage extensively with the devolved governments, industry and expert bodies to provide a suitable list of eligible investments, which might include support for training programmes and materials, for career development programmes, or for new training facilities and equipment. This list is by no means exhaustive, and the skills investment fund could be used to support a range of investments, including those that benefit key regions for offshore wind such as coastal areas around the North Sea, Celtic Sea and Irish Sea.

The government would look to work with the IGP Delivery Body’s Strategy Board, which includes representation from the devolved governments, to ensure there is sufficient skills expertise in place to identify high quality skills interventions that align with broader industrial strategy. Suitable expertise and experience would be needed to monitor the delivery and performance of the skills interventions taken forward. In practice, this could mean that a range of stakeholders would be involved in the distribution and delivery of a skills investment fund. We will look to align with - and utilise the expertise of - the Department for Education, devolved administrations and government agencies such as Skills England and Skills Development Scotland.

We recognise that developers contributing to the fund would be ceding control of how money is spent, and it is conceivable that some individual projects entering AR8 may not benefit directly. We would expect that contributing developers would be able to provide views on the investments to prioritise through industry forums, which could provide opportunity to prioritise initiatives where the benefits can be realised within AR8 projects’ lifetimes.

Option 2 – Incentivise investment in skills at the project level

A second option (option 2) would be to introduce a skills criterion into the CIB that requires investment in skills at the project level. This could mean setting an amount of a developer’s CIB minimum standard contribution that needs to be spent on skills training activities for their own project. It would be for a developer to decide on how they would spend their minimum standard obligation to meet their skills requirements within an eligible list of skills activities. The eligible list of activities could include:

Support for education attainment and upskilling

Support for training providers

Training facilities and equipment

Work experience and internships

The above list could encompass a wide range of interventions that are impactful and for which it is straightforward to evidence financial spend, in keeping with the existing CIB framework. We have considered other activities, such as ‘career progression’, but found that it was either more difficult to define tangible outcomes or more burdensome for developers to evidence spend and monitor outcomes.

The government would engage further with the sector before setting an appropriate minimum standard contribution level for skills training. Recognising that education and skills policy is a devolved matter, the relevant devolved governments will also be engaged in the process of agreeing on minimum standards. Should a developer fail to meet the minimum standard requirement for investments in the skills criterion, they would automatically have a Performance Related Adjustment applied, in the normal way, to their future CfD payments, proportional to the level of non-delivery.

A project-by-project approach would enable the CIB to set minimum standards on skills investment in a way that aligns closely with the existing framework. It may not produce the same level of impact that a more collaborative approach might do through economies of scale, however it would provide individual developers with greater control over the skills interventions they wish to invest in. This could allow developers to concentrate their investments in interventions and regions that produce direct benefits for current or future projects.

Onshore wind

The government is examining whether and how Onshore Wind (ONW) could be included into future auction rounds.

Eligibility

Onshore wind deployment is critical to the government’s clean power mission. The Clean Power Action Plan set ambitious targets of near-doubling onshore wind capacity, from 16.3GW of currently installed capacity up to 29GW by 2030. The government has taken key steps to support accelerated deployment of this critical technology, including lifting the de facto onshore wind ban in England within 72 hours of taking office and establishing the Onshore Wind Taskforce bringing together government, industry and trade unions to set out ambitious reforms to planning, grid connections, and routes to markets.

A strong supply chain offer will be essential to support our onshore wind capacity targets and harvest the benefits of increased deployment. The Onshore Wind Strategy, published on 4 July this year, outlined key actions for ensuring strong and sustainable supply chains. This included improving the quality of onshore wind supply chain data to support future policy decisions, and in tandem, exploring what government can do now to support the onshore wind industry. Expanding the CIB to include onshore wind could create momentum for investment in the sector’s supply chains.

We recognise the challenges of introducing this new technology in the scheme. The relatively smaller size of ONW projects means each has a comparatively small amount of market pull – often purchasing “off the shelf” for multiple projects at once rather than doing bespoke orders from Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs). There are also other barriers to greater investment such as the current trend of ONW OEMs rationalising (rather than expanding) their supply chains, regulatory differences between regions and concerns over rising costs. We recognise that the CIB needs to be one of several policies supporting the sector’s growth, alongside other policies trailed in recent strategic documents. In developing this policy, we have been mindful of wider work in this space, including Scotland’s onshore wind sector deal. This consultation includes proposals which, should onshore wind be included in the scheme, would aim to maximise opportunities for the sector while providing good value for money for the billpayer.

We welcome views on the opportunities and challenges of introducing onshore wind into the Clean Industry Bonus. This includes views on whether the scheme should be expanded for Allocation Round 8 or Allocation Round 9. While onshore wind in the CIB from AR8 would offer industry with a tangible opportunity to invest in cleaner and shorter supply chains, this may present a challenging timeline for developers and suppliers to familiarise themselves with the scheme and construct high-quality bids. Including onshore wind in the CIB from AR9 would allow more time for industry to consider how they could capitalise on the opportunities offered by the scheme and create strong bids. However, as 2030 approaches we are aware introducing support later may limit its impact.

From a legal perspective, the proposal to include onshore wind in the scheme would result in regulatory amendments that would allow the Allocation Framework to set which technologies would apply during an applicable Clean Industry Bonus round. This would build flexibility into regulations, should the government wish to make further changes to the scheme at a later date.

Components

As components for ONW and OFW are largely distinct, we are proposing using a separate bespoke list of components to be available for CIB extra funding:

CIB eligible components ONW

Blades

Towers

Hubs

Nacelles

Gearboxes

Generators

Cables

Other Electrical Infrastructure including Converters

Transformers

Wider Balance of Plant

Foundations

Criteria

As laid out elsewhere in this consultation, we are also considering including further criteria on skills and workforce for OFW. As introducing ONW into the CIB would be new for the industry, we are currently proposing that if ONW is introduced it would only be required to meet either of the first two criteria introduced in AR7, namely short supply chains and sustainable supply chains.

Criteria 1: short supply chains

Should we include ONW into the CIB we are currently planning to retain the same map of UK deprived areas that would qualify suppliers for additional CIB funding. This would remain consistent between OFW and ONW technologies and retains existing rationale for inclusion into the scheme, which is that funding should be channelled where it is needed most. We do acknowledge that fewer ONW suppliers currently exist within UK deprived areas, and this may have an adverse impact on the competitiveness of the auction. This is mitigated in part by the presence of a second criteria and budget revision mechanisms (see ‘process improvements’ section), which will ensure that the scheme only funds bids that are considered to provide value for money.

Criteria 2: sustainable supply chains

Suppliers demonstrating that they have considered science-based targets towards decarbonising is a key part of creating sustainable supply chains across industries. By agreeing to let the Science Based Target Initiative (SBTI) review these targets suppliers demonstrate their commitment to implementing feasible decarbonisation strategies within their organisations.

Developers can meet their minimum standard commitment by investing in a supplier signed up to the Science Based Target Initiative. Developers can put forward a CIB extra proposal to request a bonus in return for investing in a proportion of suppliers that set SBTIs across the components listed above. For offshore wind, this proportion is set at 40%, which reflects what would be expected in a business-as-usual scenario. While the scheme is intended to encourage sign up to SBTI, we recognise that fewer ONW suppliers are signed up to the SBTI than for OFW. We propose that the minimum is set at 30% for onshore wind, which means that at least 4/11 of the components listed above will need to be sourced from suppliers that sign up to the initiative to obtain extra CIB funding. This was judged to be an appropriate minimum SBTI coverage from supply chain data which shows the suppliers available for each component which has signed up to SBTI.

Portfolio-level bids

As laid out above, much of the procurement for ONW projects is done at the portfolio level due to the size of the projects. This enables economies of scale to significantly reduce project costs. To preserve developers’ capacity to maintain these savings, we propose to allow applications to be placed at the portfolio level, matching the level which industry already conducts much of its procurement.

In practice, this means a developer owning several projects would only need to make one CIB application, reducing the administrative burden of the scheme for developers, suppliers and government alike. A similar proposal is put forward for offshore wind applications – please refer to the ‘process improvements’ section of this consultation, as details differ to reflect differences in size of projects.

An application would have to list all projects included in its portfolio application. However, the applicant would not have to specify which project would be delivering the applicable minimum standard and/or CIB extra proposals at the point of application. Instead, this would occur after the CfD auction, when CIB minimum standard and extra proposals could be attributed to winning projects upon contract signature.

For onshore wind, the following definitions would apply:

Portfolio: A portfolio is a set of projects, to a minimum of one, owned by the same entity (or set of entities).

Project: The totality of a leased/owned area of land for which the bidding entity/entities obtain, or will obtain, relevant planning permission. For onshore wind, a project is assumed to be a CfD unit.

Minimum Standards

Minimum standards are set to ensure developers meet a baseline level of investment into the supply chain prior to applying for additional CIB funding. This is not set to act as a barrier to taking part in the scheme but to ensure that this scheme represents a good value for money investment for the Government.

To reflect differences in project costs and supply chains, the minimum standard for ONW could also be set lower than for OFW. Our current proposal is to set the minimum standards at £25m/GW, approximately 2% of project construction costs. Based on available supply chain information, this was judged to be a reasonable expectation of current business-as-usual investments into more deprived areas or cleaner supply chains, noting the lower number of eligible suppliers compared to the OFW supply chain, where minimum standards represent approximately 6% of project construction costs. We believe this level will enable projects to meet the minimum standard as part of their natural project expenditure. We recognise that this was calculated using a limited evidence base and commercial expertise and welcome further evidence to inform this figure.

We recognise that ONW projects are a lot smaller than OFW projects and have taken this into consideration when designing this proposal. Smaller projects may find it difficult to shoulder the administrative burden of engaging with the minimum standards process. There is also a concern that applying the same minimum standard as offshore wind would be unreasonable, given the differences in supply chains.

To address the concern related to administrative burden, we are proposing to apply a minimum standard requirement only to projects above a certain threshold of generation capacity. Below this threshold, projects would not be required to meet the CIB minimum standards in order to enter the CfD round. However, if they choose to apply for additional funding through the CIB, they would need to meet the minimum standard as part of their application. We propose that the threshold be set at 100MW, in line with Nationally Significant Infrastructure Projects (NSIP) requirements which will be coming into effect at the end of 2025. This approach allows smaller projects to participate in the CIB scheme without imposing an undue barrier to entering a CfD round. In addition, the requirement for all projects to meet minimum standards if they wish to bid for CIB funding would help ensure that consumers pay for investments above and beyond ‘business as usual’.

For developers placing portfolio-level bids, the minimum standards applied would be in relation to the total project capacity included in the portfolio. For example, three 50MW projects would have a combined generating capacity of 150MW and would be required to engage with the minimum standards as set out above. However, should only a subsection of projects within a portfolio be successful at the CfD auction round, developers would only be required to meet minimum standards proportional to the total capacity of the successful CfD bids.

Budget

The current budget of the CIB is set out as follows: there is one primary budget for all bids, within which there is a “sub-budget” for Floating Offshore Wind (FLOW). This sub-budget represents ringfenced funds for FLOW, beyond which any additional FLOW bids would need to compete with other OFW bids. This sub-budget is hidden in order to maintain competitive tension and can be adjusted at the budget revision stage by the Secretary of State.

To recognise the fact that OFW bids will benefit from greater economies of scale and more mature supply chains, we propose to create a separate sub-budget for onshore wind. This would ringfence funding for ONW, allowing for the Secretary of State to take advantage of any opportunities while also allowing funding to be transferred to OFW bids should there be a low number of bids, or to protect value for money if ONW bid quality is low. Similarly, in order to preserve competitive tension between ONW bids, we would keep the initial amount the sub-budget is set at hidden and retain the Secretary of State’s ability to adjust the sub-budget at the budget revision stage, including not to fund any bids if value for money is deemed poor. This and other regulatory changes related to sub-budgets are explained in more details in the ‘process improvements’ section of this consultation.

Process improvements

The first round of the CIB received a large number of applications, with all stakeholders successfully applying and meeting eligibility requirements, and no applicant using the appeals process. However, we identified a number of improvements in the process, or areas that would benefit from clarifications. In this section, we are proposing to amend inefficiencies or ambiguities where they are set in the CIB regulations or in the contract. Others arising from the Allocation Framework will be resolved separately later this summer.

Timelines

The current legislation governing the CIB process includes the following statutory deadlines:

Process Statutory deadline - Publication of CIB framework notice (notice of CIB application window opening and provisional budget notice) 3 months before CIB application window opening. - Final Allocation Framework published 30 days before CIB application window opening. - Final budget notice 3 weeks after CIB application window closing. - CIB results released 50 working days after the CIB application window closing. - CfD round able to launch 4 months after CIB application window opening.

Assuming one month between the CIB opening to applications and closing, these statutory deadlines mean that the theoretical minimum amount of time between a notice of a CIB application window opening and the subsequent CfD application window opening is 7 months.

Statutory deadlines should aim to strike a balance between giving stakeholders appropriate lead-in times ahead of each CIB round, providing transparency in timings, and allowing for key government policy where high-value contracts are at stake to move rapidly. The interaction between CIB timelines and the government’s commitment to deliver annual CfD rounds is particularly critical. The first round of the scheme highlighted timeline inefficiencies and constraints, which require fixing.

We are minded to amend the scheme’s statutory timelines, with the aim to reduce overall time between a CIB round notice and a CfD round. This is to ensure that the government is able to deliver on its commitment to deliver annual CfD rounds, and that the CIB and CfD auctions run in a smooth sequence. Now that industry is more familiar with the CIB process, we are confident that industry can adequately prepare in shorter timescales.

We propose to amend the current legislative timelines in the following way:

Publication of a notice of CIB application window opening and provisional budget notice: we propose that the Allocation Framework specify, round on round, when the notices related to a CIB application window opening and provisional budget would be published. We recognise the importance of communicating CIB application window timelines well in advance, as the success of a round is in part predicated on giving potential applicants sufficient lead-in times to prepare applications. Please find below a proposed timeline, including circulating a draft Allocation Framework to industry stakeholders in Autumn 2025 and launching a CIB round in March 2026.

Final Allocation Framework published: 5 days before CIB round opening. In practice, as set out below, we plan to share a complete draft of the Allocation Framework in Autumn 2025, which can be amended following engagement with stakeholders. Any amendments to the Allocation Framework following the publication of the Government Response to this consultation would be kept to fixing errors or clarifying policy.

Final budget notice: as with the provisional budget notice, we propose that the Allocation Framework determine round on round when the final budget notice would be issued. This could include a backstop for the final budget notice to be issued by the time the first CIB statement is released. This would provide government flexibility to vary timelines to account for timing requirements of future rounds. For AR8, we propose that the final budget notice be issued 25 working days after the CIB application window closing date. Compared to AR7, this allows for more time for government to assess CIB bids and set a final budget, though it does not increase the overall results processing time (see next line).

CIB results released: 35 working days after the CIB round closing.

CfD window able to open: as soon as reasonably practicable.

While the aim of these proposals is for government to move quickly and flexibly between scheme delivery milestones, this does not come at the expense of early engagement with stakeholders and overall predictability in the timeline. For full transparency, if the above proposals are implemented, the provisional intended AR8 CIB timings are as follows:

Engagement on a draft Allocation Framework September 2025. Government will update and refine the framework iteratively following industry feedback. Publication of a government response and a complete Allocation Framework draft November 2025. Government lays legislation on CIB AR8 December 2025. Government publishes a provisional budget and notice of CIB round opening as soon as the regulations are in force, likely February 2026. Final Allocation Framework is published as soon as the regulations are in force, likely February 2026. CIB round opens early March 2026. CIB round closes mid-March 2026 (two week long window). CIB results are released by end of May 2026. CfD round is able to launch after CIB results are released.

Budget

According to current regulations, the Department must set a provisional budget available to applicants for a CIB allocation round, and communicate this with industry ahead of the round. This budget can be revised, with the final budget announced within 3 weeks of the CIB round closing.

The AR7 CIB Allocation Framework made provisions for a sub-budget, dedicated to supporting investments in floating offshore wind. This meant that bids for certain floating offshore wind components were able to compete against each other for a ring-fenced budget, instead of competing in the ‘main pot’ against fixed offshore wind bids. This recognised the specificities of the floating offshore wind industry, including different componentry and investment needs. The value of the ring-fenced budget was not communicated publicly in order to preserve competitive tension within this sub-budget and ensure applicants placed value for money bids.

We are proposing to formalise the creation and functioning of sub-budgets in regulations to remove any ambiguity between the regulations and the allocation framework. We propose to continue using sub-budgets for floating offshore wind at least for AR8. Should onshore wind be included in the scheme (see elsewhere in the consultation), an onshore wind sub-budget could also be created.

From a legislative perspective, we propose that amendments to the regulations grant powers to set budget structures, round on round, through the Allocation Framework. This would provide government with flexibility to apply different budget structures depending on upcoming round’s design specificities (e.g. technologies included) and expected value for money. This would include:

Powers to set a sub-budget, or a ‘flexible minima’, recognising the different needs of certain applicants, such as floating offshore wind or onshore wind applicants. The Allocation Framework could also clarify the interactions between the sub-budgets and the general budget, with any unused funds from sub-budget able to be used in the general budget.

Powers to set separate budget ‘pots’: whilst we do not propose to use this power for AR8, the purpose of this proposal is to future-proof regulations against a variety of possible budget structures, which may be deemed to offer better value for money or be easier to administer in the future.

Powers to set a ‘maxima’: this refers to a hard cap on the amount that can be spent on bids of a certain category, e.g. bids related to a particular technology.

Powers to keep the value of the overall budget and/or of sub-budgets hidden, to preserve competitive tension if deemed appropriate.

Powers to increase or decrease the value of the overall budget and of sub-budgets, including to zero, as part of the budget revision process occurring within the period after the CIB window closed and before the auction is run.

Events outside a generator’s control

The AR7 CIB Guidance describes the process to follow in the event that a generator cannot deliver a CIB commitment due to unforeseen circumstances outside of their control. This includes proposing one or several alternative minimum standard investments. As a last resort, it also allows for the Secretary of State to deem that a generator has met minimum standards when a commitment has not been delivered due to circumstances outside of the generator’s control, when every reasonable effort to deliver the original or alternative commitments have been made.

We propose cementing this principle into regulations, with a clause stating that the Secretary of State may deem a generator to have met minimum standards even in the absence of an investment, due to events or circumstances outside of their control.

Budget notice

The provisional and final budget notices included a budget expressed in millions of pounds per gigawatt of capacity entering the auction. The original intent was to vary the budget to reflect the number of projects bidding into the auction. However, we note this created confusion amongst applicants that a project may not be able to win more than the £m/GW figure for its size.

To simplify this, we propose changing regulations to enable government to express the provisional and final budget in absolute terms rather than in £m/GW terms.

Sunset clause

Regulations currently stipulate that the Clean Industry Bonus may apply to the seventh, eight, or ninth CfD allocation rounds. We propose to extend this sunset clause, so that the CIB may be applied to rounds opening prior to 31 December 2028. This would align the scheme’s timeline with the government’s clean power mission, by extending this support to the last projects receiving a CfD that could deliver renewable energy generation by 2030. Regulations would provide for government to apply the scheme to an upcoming CfD allocation round by issuing a notice.

Payment on delivery

The scheme currently allows for applicable CIB payments to be released to generators once the project has been successfully commissioned and CfD generation payments begin. In practice, these will appear as a ‘reconciliation amount’ in respect of a billing period as nominated by the Low Carbon Contracts Company (LCCC), which administers the CfD. Payment amount and frequency will be determined by the LCCC to ensure that generators receive the full amount owed for their CIB Extra Proposals by the end of the fourth year after either their Start Date (or of their extension if applicable) or the date at which the LCCC is satisfied that it is aware of the Secretary of State’s determination that CIB Extra Proposals have been met.

This payment system means that an applicant is likely to receive CIB payments 1-3 years after relevant supply chain investments have been made, given these investments occur in the capital expenditure phase of a project. This means a debt-financed project carries the investment debt longer before CIB payments can offer financial relief, which is assumed to increase overall project financing cost and may increase the cost of the CIB bid itself.

To improve this payment timeline, we are considering the following options:

Enable payments to be made before the CfD Start Date upon release of the Implementation Statement. This means payments can be made after all investments (towards minimum standards and CIB extra proposals) have been made, but before CfD generation starts. This would improve payment timelines for generators whilst ensuring all supply chain investments have been verified, with payments released corresponding to level of delivery.

Enable payments to be made before the CfD Start Date, upon proof that the total share of the CIB extra proposals investments from the generator has been made, demonstrated through a conditional Implementation Statement. This would enable payments to be released once investments related to extra proposals have been made, but before those related to the minimum standards have been completed. This could significantly improve payment timelines for generators and may result in a more significant decrease of project financing costs and potentially the cost of CIB bids themselves. However, to protect against non-delivery of minimum standards, a claw-back mechanism would need to be designed for the LCCC to be able to retrieve funds from the generators.

In both cases, the benefits of earlier payments should be considered alongside the impact of bringing the cost of CIB for AR8 and future rounds forward on consumer bills.

For both options, we propose to maintain the current spread of payments, that is, that payments will have been fully paid to the generator by no later than the end of the 4th year after the date at which the LCCC has been made aware that the CIB Extra Proposals have been fulfilled. The government’s position is that a four-year payment window continues to provide the right balance between rewarding developers for their CIB investments whilst mitigating impact of the scheme on consumer bills.

Project-level bids

The policy intention for the CIB was for each offshore or floating offshore wind project to prepare one application and be released with one CIB Statement. This would have mirrored the process under Supply Chain Plans (the CfD supply chain legacy policy), which developers are familiar with. As CIBs mapped themselves onto CfD units, and as it is not uncommon for developers to split a large offshore wind project into several CfD units, this resulted in developers being required to complete several CIB applications per project. This significantly increased the administrative burden for developers, suppliers and government alike.

To rectify this, we are considering creating the option for project-level bids. In regulatory terms, this means removing the limitation on applications per unit, with the Allocation Framework setting out the options for project-level bids. This would be available to both offshore (fixed and floating) and onshore wind projects should they be included but would work slightly differently to reflect the different project sizes and ownership structures. For a description of the onshore wind mechanism, please refer to the onshore wind section in this consultation on ‘portfolio-level bids’.

For fixed and floating offshore wind, this would mean multiple CfD units in the same leasing zone could put forward a single CIB application. The applicant would not have to specify number or size of units at CIB application stage; though they will have to communicate to DESNZ the names and sizes of all units prior to the CfD auction round opening, so these can be added to the CIB Statement, for NESO to be able to complete checks. Applicants would only have to specify which units would be delivering the project’s minimum standard and/or CIB extra proposals after the CfD auction, where CIB minimum standard and extra proposals could be attributed to winning units upon contract signature.

We would define key terms in the following way:

Project: The totality of a leased area of sea for which the leasing entity (or entities) have obtained, or will obtain, relevant planning consent.

Unit: as defined in the CfD regulations, the whole or part of an eligible generating station.

Changes to regulations relating to the Contracts for Difference scheme

The current CfD (Allocation) Regulations 2014 require any Contract Budget Revision Notice to be published as soon as practicable after the contract allocation process has been re-run. In order to clarify that Contract Budget Revision Notices do not need to be published before results are released, we intend to amend Regulation 13B to allow for the backstop for publishing a Contract Budget Revision Notice to be when the first CfD notification is given by the Delivery Body.

Next steps

This consultation will be open to responses for 6 weeks. Responses will be used to finalise government policy on AR8 regulatory reforms to the CIB, which will be announced in a government response planned for November 2025. Legislation is expected to be laid in December 2025 and come into force by February 2026.

In parallel, the government will engage with industry on non-regulatory changes to the scheme over the summer and beyond. This includes engaging on Allocation Framework amendments and circulating a draft in September 2025, which will be updated iteratively through the Autumn.",https://www.gov.uk/assets/static/govuk-opengraph-image-4196a4d6333cf92aaf720047f56cfd91b3532d7635fc21ebcf0d5897df6b5f77.png,N,,2025-08-22 22:59:50.221523

Contact us Develop your energy tax credit strategy with professional guidance.","Tax credit transferability remains a powerful cash planning strategy for developers and investors. Introduced by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA), project owners can sell their tax clean energy credits for cash — making it easier to access capital and plan strategically.

While the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) rolled back certain energy incentives, tax credit transferability remains largely intact, creating a clear runway to transact credits for the next several years and keeping this powerful tax planning strategy firmly in play.

What is tax credit transferability?

Enacted under the IRA, Section 6418 of the Internal Revenue Code allows entities that generate certain federal clean energy tax credits to sell them to unrelated parties for cash. This is especially beneficial for developers who lack sufficient tax liabilities to use the credits themselves. It’s also an attractive alternative to historical tax equity structures that typically lock investors into partnerships for a number of years.

On the buy side of the transfer market, taxpaying C corporations can’t seem to get enough of the savings afforded by transferable credits. Due to the way Section 6418 was drafted, individuals with passive activity tax liabilities can also benefit from credit purchases; however, C corporation buyers have dominated the market.

Paying less than face value for a credit (sometimes as much as 15%), and not being taxed on the savings, seems like one of those too-good-to-be-true opportunities. But these savings are real, and corporations have flocked to the transfer market to lighten their tax bills and improve cash flow.

What the OBBBA changed — and didn’t change

Despite early drafts of the OBBBA proposing rollbacks to tax credit transferability, the final legislation preserved Section 6418’s framework, albeit with some restrictions.

Most notably, credits now cannot be transferred to prohibited foreign entities, aligning with broader national security and trade policy goals.

Additionally, the OBBBA chipped away at some of the underlying credits eligible for transfer. The most significant of these changes relates to wind and solar projects, which have been highly transacted in the market.

These projects are now facing a loss of eligibility due to the OBBBA’s accelerated termination date. Namely, projects that begin construction after July 4, 2026, must now be placed in service by the end of 2027 to qualify for investment and production tax credits under Sections 48E and 45Y, respectively. Projects that start before this date are not subject to the accelerated deadline but must still be placed in service within four years after the year construction begins to meet the continuity safe harbor.

In conjunction with the accelerated termination for wind and solar credits, the IRS further tightened compliance and documentation standards, particularly around the beginning of construction safe harbor provisions.

These changes will force many wind and solar developers to accelerate project plans to preserve tax credit eligibility.

Manufacturing credits are becoming buyer favorites

Two of the newly created credits under the IRA — Sections 45X and 45Z — directly benefit certain clean energy manufacturing activities. They’re also becoming favorites among buyers since they can generate a steady stream of credits, can be transacted in tranches on a quarterly basis, and are viewed as less risky than other credits because they’re generally not subject to recapture.

Section 45X: The tax code’s ultimate manufacturing incentive

Effective January 1, 2023, the Section 45X Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit has been a golden goose of sorts for clean energy manufacturers in the United States.

Applicable to a wide range of clean energy components — from solar equipment to critical minerals — Section 45X has developed a unique position in the market due to the large credits it can generate and the flexibility it can give buyers from a transferability perspective.

Additionally, it’s safer risk profile in the eyes of many buyers has often led to higher market pricing when compared to other transferable credits.

The OBBBA left Section 45X largely intact, although it did accelerate the phaseout of wind energy components. On the flipside, a new qualified mineral was added: metallurgical coal.

Perhaps the biggest change relates to the new prohibited foreign entity rules effective for tax years beginning after July 4, 2025. The new provisions will require many manufacturers to evaluate their supply chains to avoid tripping the “material assistance” rules, although further guidance is needed to define their meaning and scope.

Section 45Z: A new era for clean fuel tax credits

Effective January 1, 2025, Section 45Z introduced the Clean Fuel Production Credit, an incentive aimed at decarbonizing the transportation sector. The credit rewards producers of transportation fuels — both sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and non-SAF fuels — based on their lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions.

The OBBBA extended Section 45Z through December 31, 2029, originally slated for termination at the end of 2027 under the IRA.

Section 45Z consolidates and replaces several pre-IRA fuel credits and is expected to bring a surge of new production tax credits to the marketplace. Moreover, it’s expected to gain popularity with buyers due to its flexibility in terms of timing and cash flows.

How CLA can help with tax credit transactions

Despite some rollbacks of the IRA, the retention of Section 6418 in the OBBBA fosters tax credit monetization opportunities for both renewable energy developers and corporate taxpayers.

New APD electric patrol cars The backstory: ""We test these vehicles first, and then we evaluate them in the field, and then, we take that feedback, and then phase and scale up from there,"" said Rick Harland, assistant director of Austin Fleet Mobility Services.
What's next: While these are the first electric vehicles for APD, there are already about 400 EVs across other city departments.
""We're just interested to see how the electric vehicle itself will operate and complement what the rest of our fleet really is right now,"" Assistant Chief Sheldon Askew with APD, said.
If APD does get more electric vehicles, it would be in the 2027.","Austin police now have two electric patrol vehicles in their fleet. It's part of a pilot program, which will last six to 12 months.

The city says it will be more environmentally friendly and cost-efficient.

New APD electric patrol cars

The backstory:

""We test these vehicles first, and then we evaluate them in the field, and then, we take that feedback, and then phase and scale up from there,"" said Rick Harland, assistant director of Austin Fleet Mobility Services.

Manufactured by General Motors, the EVs can go up to 130 miles per hour and accelerate from zero to 60 miles per hour in four seconds.

They can run for 14 -16 hours at a time and are quieter than gas-powered ones.

The EVs are built for police use. The main difference between these and gas-powered ones is how they accelerate.

""We really wanted these vehicles to be as identical as possible to the current operation,"" Harland said.

Once all the officers get trained on them, which will be about 30 to 60 days, you'll start to see the EVs downtown. That way, they're close to their charging station and police headquarters.

Dig deeper:

The money for these comes from the general fund. The city says maintaining a gas-powered vehicle costs about 30 cents per mile. An electric one is about 10 cents per mile.

""There is some cost, because it does cost us to charge these vehicles, and it does cause us to maintain them, but you can see that the differential is pretty substantial,"" Harland said.

""It is beneficial for our climate, but it's beneficial for pocketbook. These are cheaper to maintain, they are cheaper to operate,"" Council Member Ryan Alter (District 5) said.

What's next:

While these are the first electric vehicles for APD, there are already about 400 EVs across other city departments.

""We're just interested to see how the electric vehicle itself will operate and complement what the rest of our fleet really is right now,"" Assistant Chief Sheldon Askew with APD, said.

Tax credit 101 The federal tax credits for electric vehicles are complicated, and have changed repeatedly in recent years.
Now the Trump administration is rolling back a whole suite of policies designed to promote EVs, including ending these tax credits.
Auto data giant Cox Automotive reports that new EV sales were up almost 20% year-over-year in July, and used EV sales were up 40%.
She says searches for EVs on Edmunds.com haven't increased as much as she expected as the tax credit deadline approaches.","The clock is ticking on the federal EV tax credit for electric vehicle purchases, worth up to $7,500. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act eliminated the credit, which expires Sept. 30.

But this week the IRS clarified that the deadline has a little bit of flexibility. Specifically, as long as a shopper enters a binding contract to buy a vehicle before Sept. 30, the purchase can qualify for the tax credit — even if the car isn't actually delivered until later.

A payment before the deadline is also required. ""A payment includes a nominal downpayment or a vehicle trade-in,"" the IRS notes. The tax credit won't actually be granted until the buyer takes possession of the car, but as long as the binding contract was in place before the deadline, it won't matter that the transfer happened afterward.

The IRS has typically used delivery dates to determine eligibility for the tax credit; for example, if your vehicle would have qualified for a tax credit in 2024 but not in 2025, and you took delivery on January 1, you were out of luck.

But it's not unprecedented for the agency to base eligibility on the date a contract was signed.

""The IRS has used this exact same language before, when the rules for claiming the credit changed after the Inflation Reduction Act was passed,"" notes Sean Tucker, the lead editor of Kelley Blue Book.

And the new guidance is also consistent with what lawmakers argued during debates over the the tax and spending package, when two Republican members of Congress stated that it was the ""legislative intent"" of Congress to treat a binding contract as a purchase.

Andy Phillips, the vice president of the Tax Institute at H&R Block, says the added wiggle room will be particularly helpful for car shoppers who want to buy a vehicle that's located in another state and needs to be shipped to them, or who would like to order a car that hasn't yet been manufactured. In both cases, they might run out of time to get the car delivered before the deadline.

""I can't give you exact numbers of how many people will now be able to take advantage of this credit"" because of the IRS update, he says. ""But what I can tell you is for the people that know the vehicle they want, this added flexibility will make a meaningful difference to them.""

Tax credit 101

The federal tax credits for electric vehicles are complicated, and have changed repeatedly in recent years. (Here's our most recent guide.) Unlike most tax credits, this one can now be received up-front, in the form of a discount on a vehicle purchase.

For new vehicles, the tax credits are worth up to $7,500. Vehicles have to be under a specific price cap, be made in North America, and contain a certain percentage of battery minerals and components that come from the U.S. and certain allied countries.

Meanwhile, to be eligible for the credit, buyers have to earn less than $150,000 adjusted gross income ($300,000 for married couples) — that's income after tax-deductible retirement contributions.

Qualifying vehicles are listed here, and include many Tesla, Chevrolet, Hyundai and Kia models, as well as the Ford F-150 Lightning and the Chrysler Pacifica PHEV. In each case, shoppers need to confirm with a dealer that an individual car qualifies for the credit — not all do.

Meanwhile, there's also a used vehicle credit worth up to $4,000 for EVs at least two years old that are sold for less than $25,000.

And for people who choose to lease rather than buy, $7,500 can be put toward the lease of any EV, without restrictions on price, manufacturing location or buyer income — a loophole that has pleased many automakers and frustrated many EV tax credit critics.

A looming deadline

EV and plug-in hybrid sales in the U.S. grew rapidly from 2020 to 2023. But despite continued growth overseas, since then they have been stuck in neutral in the U.S., holding steady at around 10% of the market. That was disappointing for automakers and environmentalists alike.

Now the Trump administration is rolling back a whole suite of policies designed to promote EVs, including ending these tax credits.

Analysts expect a near-term bump in EV sales, as buyers and dealers race to get ahead of the deadline, followed by a drop in sales. Auto data giant Cox Automotive reports that new EV sales were up almost 20% year-over-year in July, and used EV sales were up 40%. Earlier this month, Stephanie Valdez Streaty of Cox predicted that ""urgency is likely to remain high"" as the tax credits near expiration, and sales will be strong through the end of September.

In the long run, electric vehicles are still expected to grow in popularity, albeit slower than predicted, and automakers are still investing in new EVs designed to be cheaper.

Jessica Caldwell, the head of insights at the auto data company Edmunds, says the loss of the tax credit is ""pretty daunting"" for automakers, as they also navigate shifting tariffs and high interest rates.

She says searches for EVs on Edmunds.com haven't increased as much as she expected as the tax credit deadline approaches. ""I don't think a lot of consumers are necessarily aware this is happening,"" she says. ""With so much news going out there around autos, particularly around tariffs, some of this message may be getting lost — and people may find themselves disappointed come fall.""

That announcement came only a day after Vulcan posted on its website that its domestic rare earth magnet manufacturing capability won the Advanced Manufacturing Innovation for Maritime Readiness Challenge with support from the US Department of Defense’s Defense Industrial Base Consortium.
“The way that we think about it internally is if you think about your own body, a semiconductor is like your brain, a battery is like your heart, and a rare earth magnet is like your spine.
“No one was thinking about the third leg of that stool, which is a rare earth magnet.
One of the first rare earth magnetics labs in the US in decades Maslin met Vulcan’s co-founder, Peter Kulik, who had opened one of the first rare earth magnetics labs in the US in two decades at the University of Central Florida.","When US-based rare earth magnet manufacturer Vulcan Elements announced this week it signed a supply deal with ReElement Technologies, the financial terms were undisclosed, but the companies said that the price is “significantly below” the floor of $110 per kilogram that the US Department of Defense guaranteed to MP Materials last month.

Rare earth metals are essential in heavy magnets that power electric vehicles, consumer electronics and military applications, and MP Materials is the only US producer, out of its Mountain Pass mine in California.

While China dominates the global rare earth industry, controlling the vast majority of the world’s rare earth processing and refining capacity, Vulcan Elements’ vision is to provide domestic supply with pricing viable in the US market and beyond.

“This pricing will enable Vulcan to be competitive in global markets,” Vulcan CEO John Maslin told Reuters. “We wanted to make sure the unit economics made sense.”

Last week, the privately-held North Carolina-based start up unveiled it has raised $65 million in Series A funding to scale up its planned buildout of a commercial-scale facility in Durham.

That announcement came only a day after Vulcan posted on its website that its domestic rare earth magnet manufacturing capability won the Advanced Manufacturing Innovation for Maritime Readiness Challenge with support from the US Department of Defense’s Defense Industrial Base Consortium.

Over 400 manufacturing companies competed for the award, but Vulcan has, until now, avoided the spotlight.

“We’ve been fairly quiet intentionally, and that’s because we want to put our money where our mouths are,” Vulcan Elements CEO John Maslin told MINING.com in an interview.

“We want to execute. And now that we’re doing that, we have a lot of additional work to do where we have to execute much further at a much larger scale,” he said. “We want to show and not just tell. So now is the right time.”

The company is specifically producing neodymium iron boron magnets – and boron is a big blind spot in the US market. As with many other critical minerals, efforts are underway to re-shore supply to the US.

Maslin, a former supply chain officer with the Navy’s nuclear energy program, saw the gap working across nuclear shipbuilding and submarine programs.

“My job was effectively working with the government and appropriations and then taking that and helping finance and procure materials and components for nuclear reactors,” Maslin said.

“I was thinking a lot about the critical components that were going to be fundamental, not just for defense, but for critical economic industries, the 21st century technology race – semiconductors, batteries, rare earth magnets,” Maslin remembered.

“The way that we think about it internally is if you think about your own body, a semiconductor is like your brain, a battery is like your heart, and a rare earth magnet is like your spine. It converts electricity into motion. Everyone was focused on semiconductors and batteries at the time.

“No one was thinking about the third leg of that stool, which is a rare earth magnet. The next generation technologies, either commercially or defense related, drones, data centers that enable AI, robotics, hybrid electric vehicles, et cetera, satellites, aerospace applications, you need all three.”

“But functionally, we knew that China made over 90% of the global supply and that the US made less than 1% and that the demand for these magnets was going exponential, and there needed to be diversity and resiliency in the West.”

Maslin said that all of Vulcan Elements’ materials, whether rare earths or the electrolytic iron or the boron or ferroboron, have traceability down to the mine where that’s coming from, and that feedstock is sourced from US and allied partners.

One of the first rare earth magnetics labs in the US in decades

Maslin met Vulcan’s co-founder, Peter Kulik, who had opened one of the first rare earth magnetics labs in the US in two decades at the University of Central Florida.

“We said, this is a problem that is too important not to address. We went to the Department of Energy, and we validated our own chemistries with their scientists,” Maslin said. “We made several different grades of magnets, then built a pilot facility.”

The plan was to have the plant online by Q1 2025, fully decoupled from China down to the equipment, software, and material level.

“We opened our doors on March 31st of this year,” Maslin said. “It is a blend of defense and commercial across several different verticals and industries. We have started to deliver and qualify magnets with customers. 100% of our material is US or allied. We either get it from recycled end-of-life magnets, or directly from miners in the US and Canada and Australia, parts of Africa, parts of South America. Nothing from an entity of concern.”

The company is now moving to large-scale commercial, doing a multi-state site search.

“We’re going to go to several hundred tons over the next 18 to 24 months. The goal is to have several thousand tons online by the end of this decade,” Maslin said.

Vulcan is currently producing a mix of samples and low-volume production.

“A lot of it right now is qualification, making sure that we’re hitting the grades that we’re actually delivering the products that customers need. We’re at the point where we’re getting to actually do that with our customers who are very eager to have resilience in their supply chain.

“We have a lot of work to do to deliver even higher performing grades – but we’re moving with the speed and seriousness that this mission and this moment need.”",https://www.mining.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-22-at-14-59-24-Mail-Amanda-Stutt-Outlook.png,N,,2025-08-22 19:07:21.810702

Following the review, the agency said it is granting full exemptions to 63 petitions, granting partial exemptions to 77 petitions, denying 28 petitions, and finding seven petitions ineligible.
The exemptions granted today should have little or no effect on current and future levels of renewable fuel production and use.
It is critical, however, that the renewable fuel blending volumes associated with SREs for 2023 and 2024 are fully reallocated.
“We want to see the Renewable Fuel Standard continue to be implemented as it was intended, and we want to extend year-round, nationwide consumer access to 15% ethanol fuel blends through the summer months.","WASHINGTON — The Environmental Protection Agency is moving to resolve a years-long backlog of Small Refinery Exemption petitions under the Renewable Fuel Standard, a federal program requiring refiners to blend a minimum volume of renewable fuels into the nation’s fuel supply. The agency announced it has acted on 175 petitions filed by 38 small refineries covering compliance years 2016 through 2024.

In consultation with the Department of Energy, the EPA reviewed information submitted by each refinery before making its determinations. Officials said each petition was evaluated for consistency with the Clean Air Act and case law, with decisions based on hardship claims and economic circumstances provided by the refineries.

Following the review, the agency said it is granting full exemptions to 63 petitions, granting partial exemptions to 77 petitions, denying 28 petitions, and finding seven petitions ineligible. EPA said this clears a backlog of refinery exemption requests that has created uncertainty for years across both the refining and biofuels industries.

The Renewable Fuel Standard has been a point of contention between refiners and biofuel producers, with refiners arguing exemptions are necessary to prevent economic hardship while farm and ethanol groups contend waivers reduce demand for renewable fuels and hurt rural economies. EPA said the latest action is part of its ongoing work to put the program back on track and restore confidence in its implementation.

Growth Energy, the nation’s largest biofuel trade association, issued the following statement today in response to the decision from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) about small refinery exemptions (SREs) under the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS).

“With more than 140 granted refinery exemptions, today’s decision alone does not give farmers and biofuel producers the certainty they need,” said Growth Energy CEO Emily Skor. “It is imperative that EPA reallocates each and every exempt gallon in a forthcoming rule to mitigate the potentially devastating impact on biofuel demand. We appreciate EPA’s commitment to issue a rule that ensures promised homegrown biofuel gallons reach the marketplace and upholds the administration’s commitment to American energy dominance.”

In response to the EPA announcement, RFA President and CEO Geoff Cooper offered the following statement:

“While RFA continues to doubt that the small refineries receiving exemptions today truly experienced ‘disproportionate economic hardship’ due to the RFS, we are pleased to see EPA taking an approach to implementation of these exemptions that is minimally disruptive to the marketplace and affirms the agency’s intent to reallocate renewable fuel volumes lost to SREs. We appreciate that EPA is focused on an approach that maintains stability in the marketplace and ensures finalized annual volumes under the RFS are maintained. The exemptions granted today should have little or no effect on current and future levels of renewable fuel production and use. It is critical, however, that the renewable fuel blending volumes associated with SREs for 2023 and 2024 are fully reallocated.

“In the days ahead, RFA will be further analyzing EPA’s new approach and rationale for determining disproportionate economic hardship. According to EPA’s previous analysis, all refiners—both small and large—recoup their RIN costs when they sell gasoline and diesel. Thus, there is no credible evidence that small refiners are disproportionately affected by RFS compliance, or that the financial impact of RFS compliance rises to a level anywhere close to ‘economic hardship.’ In any case, SREs were always intended to be a temporary measure and a bridge to compliance—not a permanent handout. Small refiners have now had two full decades to adapt their operations to comply with the RFS.”

The president of the National Corn Growers Association released a statement today after the Environmental Protection Agency announced its decision to exempt some small refineries from blending biofuels in their supplies at levels required under the Renewable Fuel Standard. With today’s announcement EPA has taken an important step toward resolving a stubborn issue that has lingered without resolution for too many years, according to Illinois farmer and NCGA President Kenneth Hartman Jr.

“With government reports projecting record high corn yields this year, we continue to focus on corn demand, including increasing ethanol sales,” Hartman said. “We want to see the Renewable Fuel Standard continue to be implemented as it was intended, and we want to extend year-round, nationwide consumer access to 15% ethanol fuel blends through the summer months. Both will ensure greater energy security and lower gas prices for consumers.”",https://dehayf5mhw1h7.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/2470/2025/08/22112959/rny02802-845x563.jpg,N,,2025-08-22 22:00:13.418106

Since 2009, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)’s “endangerment finding” has held that certain greenhouse gases harm human health and the environment. Now, the agency wants to repeal emission regulations for vehicles, citing costs to consumers and private industry.

Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes joined Colorado and New Mexico’s top attorneys in speaking out against the proposed rule change this week.

“The EPA is proposing to bury its head in the sand and ignore the mounting cost of climate change for all Americans,” Mayes said.

Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser called the EPA’s proposal “misguided.”

“Ignoring common sense, including scientific research from our own government, is a recipe for disaster,” he said in a press release.

The EPA is challenging the underlying science used in the endangerment finding and said the rule has been used to justify more than $1 trillion in regulations. It has also said that the auto industry has suffered from “significant uncertainties” amid these emission regulations.

“Finally, EPA is proposing to provide much needed certainty and regulatory relief, so companies can plan appropriately, and the American people can have affordable choices when deciding to buy a car,” an agency press release stated.

This comes as the Trump administration rolls back policies promoting electric vehicles.

At the time of publication, the EPA had received more than 70,000 comments online regarding the plan. The agency had initially planned to host two full days of virtual public comments this week, but added two more to meet the demand.

The final rule is expected before the end of the year.

Since she was a child, she has seen the coal and natural gas-powered W.A. Parish Generating Station puff clouds of haze during the day and light up brightly at night. The facility — which has been around since 1958 — is both part of the background and all she thinks about.

Thomas is not alone. For decades, residents have expressed concerns over the pollution emitted from the Parish coal plant — a separate facility from the natural gas plant — and called for its closure. The plant, located about 30 miles southwest of downtown Houston, is ranked by Texas environmental regulators as one of the worst polluters in the state for certain hazardous emissions. These include mercury, a toxic heavy metal particularly harmful for children and pregnant people.

This year, mercury has been top of mind for environmental activists and residents like Thomas. In April, President Donald Trump announced an exemption for companies from implementing stricter Biden-era mercury regulations for two years. Of the 163 eligible coal plants, 11 are in Texas and six have been approved, including Parish’s operator, NRG Energy. In Missouri and Illinois, five coal plants have been exempted, and in Pennsylvania, all 12 of the coal plants seeking approval have been approved.

Then in July, Trump exempted chemical companies for two years from Biden’s 2024 HON Rule, a set of regulations that control hazardous air emissions from chemical plants called the Hazardous Organic National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants.

The Trump administration determined the exemptions are in the country’s best interest and represent a burden on industry, and that the technology is not available to meet stricter regulations. Companies like NRG agree.

However, critics say the Biden administration’s 2024 Mercury and Air Toxics Standards — called MATS for short — and the HON Rule were long overdue and the two-year delay in implementing them is merely a tactic to protect industry profit margins at the expense of public health.

Moreover, critics point out that the MATS delay may be giving companies the freedom to ignore toxic air emission rules until the Trump administration repeals the Biden-era regulations altogether. In June, the Environmental Protection Agency under Trump proposed a rule to eliminate the 2024 MATS rule completely.

The two rules together have set off alarm bells for experts and environmentalists in Texas, home to one of the world’s largest petrochemical sectors and 11 coal-powered plants. The exemptions will run from 2027 — when the Biden rules were supposed to take effect — to 2029.

“We know these rollbacks are not good for anyone, especially for those that are community fenceline,” said Thomas, also the founder and president of the Fort Bend Environmental — a grassroots organization focused on environmental justice. “We have around 1,000 homes within three miles of Parish, so that’s going to affect all of them.”

A Two-Year Delay

The EPA has been working on stricter environmental regulations for chemical plants since the early 1990s. Only in 2020 did Biden’s EPA begin drafting new rules in earnest.

But owners of the chemical plants should not act so surprised, said Neil Carman, a former regulator for the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality.

“The chemical industry has known for decades that this was all coming, but they don’t like rules, because it means they have to put on more pollution control and they have to do more leak inspections,” said Carman, now the clean air director for the Texas chapter of the Sierra Club. “These plants will always tell you safety first, safety first, but then you run into this thing called money.”

Of the 79 chemical facilities in Texas requesting exemptions, 15 have been approved, including 13 along the Gulf Coast and the so-called petrochemical corridor.

Carman pointed out that the heads of chemical companies have been in talks with Trump’s EPA since the election. In March, the administration announced that companies could apply for exemption from MATS, HON and seven other sets of emissions standards.

That same month, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin met with Dow Inc. Chairman-CEO Jim Fitterling to discuss regulations imposed by the Biden administration, according to public records and emails obtained by the Sierra Club.

In one email sent on March 17, Dow reps asked to discuss “clarity” on the EPA’s recent announcement that it will reconsider the HON rule and “Dow has met with the Office of Air and Radiation regarding an extension of the current compliance deadline, which is impossible to meet.”

In May, Zeldin met with Fitterling and other chemical company CEOs to discuss the industry at large. Then in July, Trump announced the exemptions for HON, including for two chemical plants in Louisiana and one in Seadrift, Texas, operated by Dow and its subsidiary Union Carbide.

In a statement to Capital & Main, a Dow spokesperson said that “safety and integrity are at the core of both companies’ operations” and the “extensions are appropriate and necessary to address the technical challenges and to ensure the continued safe and efficient operation of these facilities.”

Carman doesn’t buy it. He worked as an environmental regulator in Texas for 12 years. Even then, he said, companies never seemed to be able to find the budget to limit their emissions and chemical leaks. For him, it’s still the cost.

“A lot of these are old plants and so when they go in and do all this work,” Carman said, “they have to find a place where they’re going to put in new controls and they have to engineer it. They have to design it all. It’s months of planning, but these rules were out there. They knew they were coming. They just want two more years of delay.”

Limiting Mercury

When the EPA implemented the 2012 MATS rule, mercury emissions dropped 86% — or four tons — in five years.

In 2024, Biden’s EPA approved a rule to strengthen MATS by tightening the emissions standards for mercury by another 70% and reducing pollutants discharged through wastewater from coal-fired plants by more than 660 million pounds per year.

The rule could prevent as many as 11,000 premature deaths, 2,800 cases of chronic brontitis and 130,000 asthma attacks, according to the EPA under Biden.

However, in April, Trump approved the exemptions for 47 coal-powered plants across the nation. As of mid-August, 70 are now exempted, including Parish.

“These rules were just so critically important to people’s health,” said Surbhi Sarang, senior attorney for the Environmental Defense Fund. The Trump administration “was doing this process that was just not transparent. I mean, there was no process. Whereas in rulemaking, there’s public comment. This is just like a presidential action that was kind of taken in a vacuum and then announced.”

In response to the exemption, Erik Linden, senior director of communications at NRG, said the time is needed and will be used to evaluate the technology for air quality systems and monitoring equipment for compliance.

“All existing MATS emission controls will be properly maintained and remain in service,” Linden said of the current MATS rules that began in 2012. The exemption would give NRG until 2029 to implement the changes.

However, in July, Trump’s EPA proposed eliminating Biden’s rule entirely by the end of the year. Interested parties had three weeks to submit comments, and the Environmental Defense Fund’s request for an extension was denied.

“Rule-making usually takes 12-18 months if not longer,” Sarang said. “They’re moving very quickly.”

All of this is alarming for residents living near industry. With the extent of the changes to environmental regulations coming down from the Trump administration, there’s a lot for Thomas, the Parish generating station neighbor, to process. But she hasn’t given up. Increasingly, Thomas is talking to her neighbors and fellow residents about fighting back.

This means sending letters to representatives in Texas and in Washington, D.C. Thomas said it pays to be loud.

Parish is “going to do the same thing it’s been doing,” Thomas said. “If the EPA does not put a stop to these [emissions] getting out, then everyone is going to pay for this with their lives and in their water and in their air.”

The delay, while occurring after the elimination of EV tax credits, is reportedly unrelated according to Nissan.

Nissan cites prioritizing customer demand and market timing as the reason for the change.

This follows Nissan's shift of Leaf production from Tennessee to Japan due to stronger demand in other markets.

Nissan will further delay the production of three all-new fully electric SUVs at its Canton, Mississippi plant, marking a three-year postponement from the originally planned 2025 debut.

Although the specific models haven't been revealed, Nissan spokesperson Amanda Plecas confirmed that ""three fully electric SUV models, including versions for both Nissan and Infiniti,"" are expected to begin production at the Canton Vehicle Assembly Plant in 2028.

The delay comes four days after President Donald Trump signed the “Big Beautiful Bill,” which axes EV tax incentives for consumers.

Specifically, the bill will eliminate a $7,500 tax credit for households that buy or lease a new EV. It also removes a $4,000 credit for those who purchased a used EV.

Although EV tax-exemptions will dissipate in September, Plecas said the move is “not related” to Trump's bill.

“We adjusted the timeline for the introduction of these new models to ensure we bring the vehicles to the market at the right time, prioritizing in line with customer demand and maximizing the opportunity for our brands and supplier partners,” Plecas said.

Nissan Leaf production moved from Tennessee to Japan

In November, Nissan concluded its Tennessee-based production of the Leaf, relocating the EV's operations to Japan.

Nissan’s Smyrna Vehicle Assembly Plant Vice President Brian Crockett said shifting Leaf production to Japan “doesn’t have anything to do with the current situation” concerning tariffs and eliminating EV tax breaks. The company prioritizes “building where we sell” and informing demand “is a huge driving factor for the Leaf perspective as well,"" he said.

“The Leaf does extremely well in the European market, it does extremely well in the [Asian] market” but only “does OK in the U.S. market,” Crockett said.

In recent months, policy changes like the “Big, Beautiful Bill” have dampened EV demand in the U.S. These changes “raised the potential that future growth rates will be more mild,” according to a S&P Global June auto sales report.

With a focus on localizing demand, Nissan will continue producing the Altima and Frontier at the Canton Vehicle Assembly Plant for now.

“Our goal is to ensure that this facility continues to bring highly competitive vehicles to market that exceed customer expectations,” Nissan spokesperson Lloryn Love-Carter told The Tennessean, part of the USA TODAY Network.

On top of slowed EV demand, Nissan has dealt with its own problems, highlighted by a 200 billion yen ($1,352,111,000) operating loss in the first quarter, according to Reuters.

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ruled last week that the costs for keeping Campbell open could be spread across 10 states across the Midwest.","WASHINGTON - The US Energy Department on Thursday extended an order for a Michigan coal plant to stay open through November 19, even though it had been planning to shut permanently for economic reasons and complying with the original order has already cost the company tens of millions of dollars.

In May, the Energy Department issued the original order, normally reserved for natural disasters, for the 1 500 megawatt J.H. Campbell plant in West Olive, Michigan to stay open. The order came a week before Consumers Energy, the majority owner of the plant, planned to shut and after it had depleted its coal stockpile and reassigned staff.

Thursday's order is the latest in a string of US moves to support fossil fuels, after President Donald Trump declared an energy emergency on the first day of his second term. In April, he signed executive orders aiming to boost coal production, in one of a series of actions that run counter to global efforts to curb carbon emissions, saying the administration was ""going to put the miners back to work.""

Chris Wright, the US energy secretary, said the order ""will help ensure millions of Americans can continue to access affordable, reliable, and secure baseload power regardless of whether the wind is blowing or the sun is shining.”

Trump claims that rapid adoption of solar and wind power has made US electricity unstable and expensive, justifying his bid to end most subsidies for them. But reliability has improved in Texas, the US grid with the most renewable energy, according to regulatory filings and price data reviewed by Reuters.

Consumers Energy said in a financial filing that staying open cost $29 million over the first 38 days since the first order.

A report commissioned by environmental groups said this month that keeping Campbell open would cost $279-million annually. It said if the US mandates keeping open fossil fuel plants that had been slated to retire by the end of 2028, it could cost $3-billion or more per year. The costs, it said, would be distributed across homeowners and businesses that pay power bills in all regions but the U.S. Northeast.

As a result, the agency has granted full exemptions to 63 petitions and partial exemptions to 77 petitions, denied 28 petitions and determined seven petitions to be ineligible.

The actions follow a June EPA announcement that it would propose Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) volume requirements for 2026 and 2027.

The EPA says it is reaffirming the policy it set in the first Trump administration through the 2020 Renewable Volume Obligation Rulemaking, granting partial relief (a 50 percent exemption) where a small refinery has demonstrated that it faces partial hardship. Under DOE’s 2011 Small Refinery Study, small refineries would have been denied any relief despite demonstrating partial hardship. With today’s action, EPA says it “is getting the SRE program back on track with an approach that recognizes some small refineries are impacted more significantly than others and that EPA’s relief should reflect those differences.”

The agency will update the RFS Small Refinery Exemption website to reflect its action on the 175 petitions.

The EPA also says it is reaffirming a policy to return RFS compliance credits, known as Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs), previously retired for compliance when a small refinery receives an exemption for a prior compliance year. In a news release about the action, the EPA explains that RINs have a two-year window for use under the RFS, covering the compliance year in which they were generated and the following compliance year. “Therefore, while 2022 and earlier vintage RINs are not eligible for use to meet the open 2024 compliance obligations or future obligations, these vintage RINs can be used to demonstrate compliance for prior compliance years consistent with their two-year window. Ultimately, this means that the 2022 and earlier vintage RINs will not impact the number of RINs available to meet 2024 and future compliance obligations and are not expected to impact demand for biofuels,” the EPA adds.

The agency says it will submit a draft supplemental proposed rule to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) on the proposed reallocations of the 2023 and later compliance year exempted volumes. EPA adds that it does not plan to propose reallocation of any of the exempted volumes for any SREs from 2016-2022 in light of the limitation on their potential use and that it will provide updated information on how the agency intends to project SREs for 2026 and 2027 in the context of establishing percentage standards for those years.

The proposed adjustments will help ensure refineries blend the intended volumes of renewable fuel into the nation’s fuel supply in 2026 and 2027 after accounting for the SREs granted for 2023 and 2024 in today’s actions and projected SREs granted for 2025-2027, the EPA says. “The supplemental proposal will seek to balance the goals of the RFS in supporting the production and use of renewable fuels while taking into account economic impacts, following the law and ensuring opportunity for stakeholder comment.”

Washington-based American Biogas Council (ABC) Executive Director Patrick Serfass praised the timing of the EPA’s actions on the RFS regarding SREs and the renewable volume obligations (RVOs).

“Issuing SREs now, before the RVOs are finalized, allows the EPA to balance both levers in the RFS to make sure they work together harmoniously and promote the healthy function of the RINs market. The RVOs set demand for the RINs market, and SREs decrease demand. Announcing the SREs now gives the EPA the opportunity to follow the recommendation from the American Biogas Council and other renewable fuel producers to increase RVOs, which would increase demand and balance out the impact of issuing SREs,” Serfass says.

“Without an increase in RVOs, RIN credit prices could crash, creating a harmful economic ripple effect across rural America. The EPA can make this all work together to protect farmers and rural communities, who depend on a strong, stable RFS program.”",https://www.wastetodaymagazine.com/fileuploads/image/2025/08/22/adobestock_459199581.jpg,N,,2025-08-22 19:05:20.871961

By reshoring production, securing strategic partnerships, and launching cost-effective EVs, GM is poised to outperform in 2026.","General Motors (GM) is emerging as a case study in strategic adaptability amid the turbulent U.S. trade environment. With tariffs on imported vehicles from Mexico and Canada looming at up to 25%, the automaker has executed a multifaceted playbook to mitigate risks while accelerating its transition to electric vehicles (EVs). For investors, the question is whether these moves position GM to outperform in 2026, even as the industry grapples with policy uncertainty and global supply chain volatility.

Production Reallocation: A Shield Against Tariff Headwinds

GM's most immediate response to tariff pressures has been a deliberate reshoring of production. The company has redirected over 650,000 units of Mexican-made vehicles—primarily Chevrolet Silverados and GMC Sierra pickups—toward U.S. domestic sales, while shifting international-bound production to markets like China and Europe. This reallocation is part of a $4 billion investment in U.S. manufacturing, including expansions in Michigan, Kansas, and Tennessee. By 2027, GM aims to add 300,000 units of high-margin capacity for light-duty trucks and SUVs, a segment that accounts for 60% of U.S. retail sales.

The financial implications are stark. GM revised its 2025 EBIT guidance downward by $3.7 billion to $10–$12.5 billion, reflecting the anticipated $4–$5 billion hit from tariffs. However, the company's pivot to domestic production reduces exposure to cross-border costs. For example, the Fort Wayne, Indiana, plant—receiving a $632 million investment—will produce an additional 50,000 units annually, bypassing Mexican tariffs entirely. This shift not only insulates GM from immediate financial shocks but also aligns with U.S. policy incentives for domestic manufacturing, such as the Excelsior Jobs Program in New York.

Strategic Partnerships: Diversifying Supply Chains and R&D Costs

GM's resilience extends beyond production. The automaker has forged partnerships to stabilize its supply chain and reduce R&D costs. A notable collaboration is with Hyundai Motor, under which the two companies co-develop five new models by 2028, including a commercial van targeting North America. This partnership leverages Hyundai's global scale and GM's U.S. market expertise, reducing per-unit costs by up to 20% for both firms.

Battery sourcing is another critical area. GM temporarily imported lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries from Chinese supplier CATL to power its 2026 Chevrolet Bolt EV, a stopgap measure until domestic LFP production with LG Energy Solution begins in 2027. While these batteries face an 80% tariff burden (combining 25% on automotive components and 55% on Chinese goods), LFP's 35% cost advantage over nickel-cobalt batteries offsets some of the impact. This strategy ensures the Bolt remains competitive at a projected $30,000 price point, even as the federal EV tax credit expires in September 2025.

GM also secured rare earth magnet supplies from U.S. producers like Noveon Magnetics and MP Materials, reducing reliance on foreign materials. These magnets, critical for EV motor efficiency, are now sourced domestically, insulating GM from geopolitical disruptions and further stabilizing costs.

2026 EV Launches: A Catalyst for Growth

The 2026 model year will be pivotal for GM's EV strategy. The Chevrolet Bolt EV, Cadillac Escalade IQ, and GMC Sierra EV Denali are set to dominate the lineup, each leveraging LFP battery technology for cost efficiency and range improvements. The Bolt, in particular, is positioned to capture mainstream buyers with its affordability and 400+ mile EPA-estimated range. Analysts project the Bolt could generate $200 million in 2026, with revenue expected to double by 2027.

Beyond hardware, GM is monetizing software through Super Cruise and OnStar services, which generated $4 billion in deferred revenue in 2025. These recurring revenue streams provide a buffer against hardware margin pressures, a critical advantage as the EV market matures.

Investment Implications: A Case for Outperformance

For investors, GM's strategic moves create a compelling case for outperformance in 2026. The company's dual-track approach—balancing EV and ICE production—ensures flexibility in a market where demand remains uneven. Wedbush Securities recently raised its price target for GM to $65 from $55, citing the automaker's ability to navigate tariffs and its robust 2026 product pipeline.

Key risks include the potential for prolonged tariff disputes and delays in domestic battery production. However, GM's diversified supply chain, production reshoring, and software monetization strategies mitigate these risks. The company's $2 billion accelerated share repurchase in Q2 2025, which reduced its share count by 4%, also signals confidence in its capital structure.

Conclusion: A Resilient Path Forward

General Motors is not merely surviving the current trade environment—it is leveraging it to strengthen its long-term position. By reshoring production, securing strategic partnerships, and launching cost-effective EVs, GM is poised to outperform in 2026. For investors, the combination of operational discipline, innovation, and market adaptability makes GM a compelling long-term play, particularly in a sector where strategic agility is the new competitive edge.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-22 19:07:44.794543

WASHINGTON – With electricity prices rising at more than twice the rate of inflation, President Donald Trump has lashed out at renewable energy sources such as wind and solar power, blaming them for skyrocketing energy costs.

Trump called wind and solar power “THE SCAM OF THE CENTURY!” in a social media post and vowed not to approve wind or “farmer destroying Solar” projects. “The days of stupidity are over in the USA!!!” he wrote on his Truth Social site.

Energy analysts say renewable sources have little to do with recent price hikes, which are based on increased demand, aging infrastructure and increasingly extreme weather events such as wildfires that are exacerbated by climate change.

The rapid growth of cloud computing and artificial intelligence has fueled demand for energy-hungry data centers that need power to run servers, storage systems, networking equipment and cooling systems. Increased use of electric vehicles also has boosted demand, even as the Trump administration and congressional Republicans move to restrict tax credits and other incentives for EV purchases approved under the Biden administration.

Natural gas prices, meanwhile, are rising sharply amid increased exports to Europe and other international customers. More than 40% of U.S. electricity is generated by natural gas.

Trump promised during the 2024 campaign to lower Americans' electric bills by 50%. Democrats have been quick to blame him for the price hikes, citing actions to hamstring clean energy in the sprawling tax-and-spending cut bill approved last month, as well as regulations since then to further restrict wind and solar power.

Advocates say renewables provide the extra energy needed

“Now more than ever, we need more energy, not less, to meet our increased energy demand and power our grid. Instead of increasing our energy supply Donald Trump is taking a sledgehammer to the clean energy sector, killing jobs and projects,” said New Mexico Sen. Martin Heinrich, the top Democrat on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee.

The GOP bill will cost thousands of jobs and impose higher energy costs nationwide, Heinrich and other critics said.

A report from Energy Innovation, a non-partisan think tank, found the GOP tax law will increase the average family's energy bill by $130 annually by 2030. “By quickly phasing out technology-neutral clean energy tax credits and adding complex material sourcing requirements,” the tax law will “significantly hamper the development of domestic electricity generation capacity,” the report said.

Renewable advocates were more blunt.

“The real scam is blaming solar for fossil fuel price spikes,” the Solar Energy Industries Association said in response to Trump's post.

“Farmers, families, and businesses choose solar to save money, preserve land, and escape high costs of the old, dirty fuels being forced on them by this administration,” the group added.

As technology improves, wind and solar offer some of the cheapest and fastest ways to provide electric power. More than 90% of new energy capacity that came online in the U.S. in 2024 was clean energy, said Jason Grumet, CEO of the American Clean Power Association, another industry group.

States with the highest share of clean energy production have seen prices decline in the past year, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, while prices have gone up in states with the least renewable energy use.

“By slowing clean energy deployment, the Trump administration is directly fueling cost increases,” Grumet said

“Blocking cheap, clean energy while doubling down on outdated fossil fuels makes no economic or environmental sense,” added Ted Kelly, director of U.S. clean energy for the Environmental Defense Fund, a nonprofit advocacy group.

Partisanship anchors debate over rising energy prices

Energy Secretary Chris Wright blamed rising prices on “momentum” from Biden-era policies that backed renewable power over fossil fuel sources such as oil, coal and natural gas.

“That momentum is pushing prices up right now. And who's going to get blamed for it? We're going to get blamed because we're in office,” Wright told POLITICO during a visit to Iowa last week. About 60% of the state's electricity comes from wind.

Not all the pushback comes from Democrats.

Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley, a Republican who backs wind power, has placed a hold on three Treasury nominees to ensure wind and solar have “an appropriate glidepath for the orderly phaseout of the tax credits” approved in the 2022 climate law under former President Joe Biden.

Grassley said he was encouraged by new Treasury guidance that limits tax credits for wind and solar projects but does not eliminate them. The guidance “seems to offer a viable path forward for the wind and solar industries to continue to meet increased energy demand,” Grassley said in a statement.

John Quigley, senior fellow at the Kleinman Center for Energy Policy at the University of Pennsylvania, said the Republican tax law will increase U.S. power bills by slowing construction of solar, wind, and battery projects and could eliminate as many as 45,000 jobs by 2030.

Trump administration polices that emphasize fossil fuels are “an extremely backward force in this conversation,” Quigley said. “Besides ceding the clean energy future to other nations, we are paying for fossil foolishness with more than money – with our health and with our safety. And our children will pay an even higher price.”",https://imengine.public.prod.dur.navigacloud.com/?uuid=e4877e24-6d1f-51b3-863f-c6e48aab7eac&function=fit&type=preview,N,,2025-08-22 19:06:32.098851

After carefully reviewing all information, EPA is granting full exemptions to 63 petitions, granting partial exemptions to 77 petitions, denying 28 petitions, and determining 7 petitions to be ineligible.

EPA is reaffirming the policy it set in the first Trump Administration through the 2020 Renewable Volume Obligation Rulemaking, granting partial relief (a 50 percent exemption) where a small refinery has demonstrated that it faces partial hardship. Under DOE’s 2011 Small Refinery Study, small refineries would have been denied any relief despite demonstrating partial hardship. With today’s action, EPA is getting the SRE program back on track with an approach that recognizes some small refineries are impacted more significantly than others and that EPA’s relief should reflect those differences. Concurrent with this decision, EPA will update the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) Small Refinery Exemption website to reflect action on the 175 petitions.

At the same time, EPA is reaffirming a policy to return RFS compliance credits, known as Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs), previously retired for compliance when a small refinery receives an exemption for a prior compliance year. Under the RFS program, RINs have a two-year window for use, covering the compliance year in which they were generated and the following compliance year. Therefore, while 2022 and earlier vintage RINs are not eligible for use to meet the open 2024 compliance obligations or future obligations, these vintage RINs can be used to demonstrate compliance for prior compliance years consistent with their two-year window. Ultimately, this means that the 2022 and earlier vintage RINs will not impact the number of RINs available to meet 2024 and future compliance obligations and are not expected to impact demand for biofuels.

Finally, in the near future, EPA will submit a draft supplemental proposed rule to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) on the proposed reallocations of the 2023 and later compliance year exempted volumes. EPA does not plan to propose reallocation of any of the exempted volumes for any SREs from 2016 – 2022 in light of the limitation on their potential use. EPA will also be providing updated information on how the agency intends to project SREs for 2026 and 2027 in the context of establishing percentage standards for those years. The proposed adjustments will help ensure that refineries blend the intended volumes of renewable fuel into the nation’s fuel supply in 2026 and 2027 after accounting for the SREs granted for 2023 and 2024 in today’s actions and projected SREs granted for 2025 – 2027 in Set 2. The supplemental proposal will seek to balance the goals of the RFS in supporting the production and use of renewable fuels while taking into account economic impacts, following the law, and ensuring opportunity for stakeholder comment.

Background

In June, EPA announced a major step forward to strengthen American energy security and support American farmers by proposing RFS volume requirements for 2026 and 2027. This action represents a critical and much-needed step in the evolution of this program. Under President Trump’s leadership, EPA’s “Set 2” proposal ensures the RFS program remains true to Congress’ original intent of increasing the use of homegrown American biofuels, unleashing American energy, and supporting rural economies.

The comment period for the proposed rule closed on August 8, 2025. EPA is currently reviewing the comments submitted on the “Set 2” proposed rule and working on a final regulation. Upon publication of a supplemental proposed rule on potential reallocation of the 2023 and later compliance year exempted volumes, as described above, EPA will accept public comments on this supplemental proposal.",,N,,2025-08-22 22:00:17.041330

The bill would impact federal coal ash work but would not block states from taking action.","A U.S. Department of Justice attorney has given an update to the Environmental Protection Agency’s plan to revise coal ash rules, which would impact communities nationwide, including potentially some in Northwest Indiana.

In an Aug. 19 email, a representative from EarthJustice told the Post-Tribune that the EPA plans to release a draft of the revised coal ash rule by Jan. 30, 2026, and the final rule by Oct. 30, 2026.

EarthJustice is a San Francisco-based nonprofit public interest environmental law organization that works with community groups nationwide.

The EPA announced in July that it will extend compliance deadlines for monitoring and cleaning up coal ash, a byproduct that is created primarily from burning coal in power planes, according to the agency. If the compliance deadlines are extended, coal plant owners could stall clean up past 2030.

“(President Donald) Trump’s EPA is abandoning its responsibility to communities across the country, allowing toxic coal ash to continue contaminating water supplies,” Lisa Evans, senior counsel for EarthJustice, said in a previous news release. “The longer industry delays dealing with its toxic mess, the more toxic waste enters our water, and the more difficult and costly cleanup becomes. These coal power companies cannot escape liability for their reckless release of toxic coal ash.”

In addition to rule changes, the EPA might take other actions on coal ash, including: outsourcing oversight in some states by approving bad state permit programs; weakening power plant wastewater treatment guidelines; exempting some use of coal ash on coal plant properties from cleanup requirements; implementing a broader gutting of coal ash regulations; and finalizing a draft federal coal ash permit program that will enable the EPA to grant lifetime permits for waste sites.

The EPA will host a hearing at 8 a.m. Sep. 12 about the changes to the coal ash rule. Those interested in the online hearing can register through the EPA’s website.

“President Trump recognizes that affordable and reliable energy are key to the strength of our nation and to our nation’s energy dominance,” EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin previously said in a statement. “Today’s actions provide much needed regulatory relief for the power sector and help deliver on the commitments outlined on the greatest day in deregulatory to unleash American energy, lower costs for Americans, and work hand-in-hand with our state partners to advance our shared mission.”

In Northwest Indiana, the Town of Pines has been contaminated by coal ash from the nearby Yard 520 landfill, which held more than one million tons of coal ash from NIPSCO’s Michigan City Generating Station.

“NIPSCO is committed to following the direction of the U.S. EPA to ensure the Town of Pines remediation work is conducted properly so that human health and the environment are protected,” NIPSCO Communications Manager Jessica Cantarelli said in a previous statement.

In addition to EPA coal ash changes, an interior and environment appropriations bill is making its way through Congress and would not allow the EPA to use funds to implement or enforce the federal coal ash bill, if passed.

The bill would impact federal coal ash work but would not block states from taking action. Cleanups continue to be delayed while federal rules are debated, which allows for further contamination.

Rep. Frank Mrvan, D-Highland previously told the Post-Tribune in a statement that he supported an amendment to remove “harmful provisions” that eliminated the EPA’s ability to support local and state cleanup efforts at legacy pollution sites.

“All efforts to address coal ash must prioritize the health, safety and quality of life of families across Northwest Indiana for generations to come,” Mrvan said. “I will continue to advocate for environmental protections to keep our communities safe and address the harmful impacts of coal ash.”",https://www.chicagotribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/PTB-L-PINES-CLEANUP-1212-9_a3a8cd.jpg?w=1024&h=683,N,,2025-08-22 18:04:30.790067

Countries such as Namibia are leveraging abundant sunshine and wind to generate green hydrogen (GH2), opening avenues for economic diversification, job creation, and energy self-reliance.

The Namibian government projects that a full-scale GH2 industry could create around 85,000 direct jobs by 2030, along with 60,000 indirect jobs. Crucially, partnerships with international investors are being structured as “partnerships of equals” that deliver local value: they get green hydrogen, and Namibia gains jobs and added value. By exporting energy while developing domestic industries, African GH2 initiatives aim to ensure inclusive growth that benefits local communities, not just foreign offtakers.

Energy security and climate resilience

Green hydrogen is not merely an export commodity; it also has the potential to strengthen Africa’s energy security and climate resilience. In Namibia, the GH2 rollout will substantially expand domestic renewable generation, which can power the national grid and reduce dependence on imported fossil fuels. The Hyphen project alone could produce so much additional clean electricity that it would meet all of Namibia’s internal power needs and even export power to neighbouring nations. This is a transformative prospect for a country that currently imports a significant share of its electricity.

Decentralised hydrogen production hubs, integrated with solar and wind, also enhance reliability — acting as mini-grids that can supply industry and communities around the clock. Such systems are inherently more climate-resilient, as they diversify the energy mix and provide backup fuel for critical services.

Green hydrogen development can also address multiple infrastructure gaps. For example, large-scale projects often include desalination plants to supply water for electrolysis, with millions of cubic metres of excess freshwater made available for local agriculture and households. In Mauritania, planners estimate that the planned GH2 industry will deliver over 50 million m³ of desalinated water annually for domestic use, alongside hydrogen-powered public buses to reduce urban pollution. By coupling energy and water solutions, hydrogen hubs can improve access to essential resources.

Moreover, using some of the hydrogen locally, for buses, trucks, or fertiliser, enhances domestic energy security, reducing imports of diesel or ammonia and buffering against global supply shocks. In South Africa, for instance, green hydrogen is viewed not only as an export opportunity but also as “a means to decarbonise (the) large heavy-industry and mining sectors” currently reliant on coal. This transition will safeguard the future of key industries, such as steel, chemicals, and mining. In short, GH2 is becoming integral to national strategies for building resilient economies and cleaner, more secure energy systems across Africa.

A continental hydrogen wave

Namibia’s progress is part of a broader African green hydrogen boom that is capturing global attention. Six countries, namely, Egypt, Kenya, Mauritania, Morocco, Namibia, and South Africa, have formed the Africa Green Hydrogen Alliance to coordinate efforts and speak with one voice.

Mauritania, for instance, is planning mega-projects totalling approximately 85 GW of renewables, aiming to produce 12.5 million tonnes of green hydrogen annually by 2035. Several consortia are advancing rapidly: one, led by British, French, and Australian firms, plans the 10 GW Project Nour, while another (CWP Global’s Aman) targets 30 GW. These developments could make Mauritania one of the world’s top hydrogen suppliers and support a domestic green steel industry by using hydrogen to process the country’s iron ore.

Likewise, Morocco and Egypt have signed dozens of agreements for green ammonia and e-fuels, leveraging their vast deserts and proximity to Europe. South Africa is repurposing its expertise in Fischer-Tropsch fuels and platinum-based electrolysis towards GH2, with national utility Eskom and companies such as Sasol planning hydrogen hubs in industrial zones. Even smaller economies such as Kenya are exploring green hydrogen from geothermal and solar resources to both electrify rural areas and produce fertiliser.

What distinguishes this wave is its emphasis on sustainable, inclusive development. Many African GH2 projects include frameworks for local content, skills transfer, and community engagement from the outset. Across the continent, universities and technical institutes are launching programmes to train the future hydrogen workforce, while governments are insisting that a share of value-added activities, such as component manufacturing or mineral processing, take place on African soil. If managed wisely, green hydrogen could become a catalyst for industrialisation in Africa’s resource-rich nations, transforming renewable resource abundance into high-value products and well-paid jobs.","https://www.energyconnects.com/media/kowdvctf/hafeni-motsi.jpg?center=0.261295590636908,0.43080578103345873&mode=crop&width=1200&height=628&rnd=134003278098530000",N,,2025-08-22 19:04:29.188297

In May, the Energy Department issued the original order, normally reserved for natural disasters, for the 1,500 megawatt J.H. Campbell plant in West Olive, Michigan to stay open. The order came a week before Consumers Energy, the majority owner of the plant, planned to shut and after it had depleted its coal stockpile and reassigned staff.

Thursday’s order is the latest in a string of U.S. moves to support fossil fuels, after President Donald Trump declared an energy emergency on the first day of his second term. In April, he signed executive orders aiming to boost coal production, in one of a series of actions that run counter to global efforts to curb carbon emissions, saying the administration was “going to put the miners back to work.”

Chris Wright, the U.S. energy secretary, said the order “will help ensure millions of Americans can continue to access affordable, reliable, and secure baseload power regardless of whether the wind is blowing or the sun is shining.”

Trump claims that rapid adoption of solar and wind power has made U.S. electricity unstable and expensive, justifying his bid to end most subsidies for them. But reliability has improved in Texas, the U.S. grid with the most renewable energy, according to regulatory filings and price data reviewed by Reuters.

Consumers Energy said in a financial filing that staying open cost $29 million over the first 38 days since the first order.

A report commissioned by environmental groups said this month that keeping Campbell open would cost $279 million annually.

The next three years could see some unexpected territories in Europe outperform these traditional powerhouses, according to financial analysts.

Europe has several hidden investment gems with amazing wealth-building potential that fly under most investors’ radar. The European stock markets show smaller, specialised sectors gaining ground, especially technology, green manufacturing, clean energy, pharmaceuticals, and financial services. Your investment strategy needs a solid grasp of european market trends in 2025 to stay ahead of the crowd.

These five lesser-known markets could deliver impressive returns, ranging from Portugal’s thriving tech scene to Ireland’s financial boom after Brexit. Each of these areas offers unique advantages, including government support, industry clusters, and prime locations that contribute to sustainable growth.

We Identify 5 Hidden Growth Spots in Europe

We have identified five exceptional growth markets in Europe that offer huge potential returns for investors. These hidden opportunities remain remarkably strong despite tough economic conditions. We found specific regions across the continent that regularly outperform the broader MSCI Europe ex UK index.

You can take advantage of the underlying attractiveness of European markets, which are expected to capture the opportunities we foresee in the future. Research unequivocally demonstrates that these undervalued markets outperform conventional investment destinations.

How these markets were selected

We discovered these hidden growth spots through a systematic investment approach that focuses on four key pillars: quality, value, dividend potential, and conviction. Rather than following common beliefs about popular markets, we used a bottom-up method. We started by looking at individual companies first and then spotted emerging patterns in specific regions.

The selection process started by filtering about 1,400 European companies through strict quality criteria. Companies needed to show eight straight years of cash flow return on investment above 8% to pass the first screening. This requirement narrowed the field to roughly 250 companies that showed:

Effective capital allocation

Sustainable competitive advantages

Consistent value creation

Robust capital structures

Additional analysis looked at companies with strong balance sheets and market caps over €500 million. This resulted in about 200 high-quality businesses. Financial metrics indicated that these companies outperformed broader European market trends in the following areas:

Return on equity of 21.9% (compared to 11.8% for the MSCI Europe ex UK index)

Debt-to-equity ratio of 70.7% (versus 184.8% for the index)

Free cash flow yield of 7.4% (compared to 4.8% for the index)

We target a sustainable dividend yield and aim to grow the dividend stream year over year. This dividend focus helps us find regions where companies consistently deliver both growth and income—something rare in current european stock market trends.

What makes them ‘hidden’ yet promising

Most investors overlook these five growth spots because they exist outside major economies like Germany and France. The performance data shows these markets have delivered impressive returns despite their lower profile:

Outperformance: Companies in these regions have contributed to investment returns of 21.9% over one year and 90.3% over five years. This is a big deal, as it means that they beat the broader European market.

Quality premium: Businesses in these markets trade at a modest premium (P/E of 15.3x versus 14.5x for the index) yet deliver nearly twice the return on equity.

Lower leverage: Much healthier balance sheets provide resilience against economic shocks and room for future growth.

Dividend advantage: Companies provide both higher yields (3.6% versus 3.3%) and more sustainable payout ratios.

Our bottom-up approach naturally reveals regional allocation instead of preconceived ideas about which countries should do well. Our research highlights that regional allocation depends on stock selection, indicating that these five markets excel due to the quality of their companies rather than macroeconomic forecasts.

These markets have structural advantages that will position them well for european market trends in 2025. Their specialised industrial clusters have developed unique capabilities that large economies find difficult to match. The data shows that these regions have companies with average market capitalisations of €65.3 billion and median market caps of €29.1 billion—substantial businesses that mainstream investors often overlook.

The European market analysis also shows these regions have stronger ESG credentials. About 94% of companies in these markets achieve average or leader ESG ratings compared to 90% for the broader European index. This focus on sustainability provides them an edge as regulatory requirements become stricter across the continent.

Regardless of the weather, the focus remains on quality companies trading at attractive valuations. Our approach has uncovered the five regional powerhouses detailed in the following sections.

Portugal Attracts Tech Investment Surge

Portugal has become an unexpected powerhouse in Europe’s tech world. Investment capital has flowed into the country at record rates since 2023. This southwestern European nation was once known mainly for tourism and traditional industries but has turned into a magnet for tech entrepreneurs and venture capitalists who look for better returns than saturated markets offer.

Lisbon’s rise as a startup hub

Lisbon is now one of Europe’s most dynamic startup ecosystems; it rivals tech centres like Berlin and Amsterdam. The Portuguese capital combines affordable living, a fantastic quality of life, and access to talent in ways that bigger markets can’t match.

The city’s tech journey started when Web Summit moved to Lisbon in 2016 and has grown much faster in the past two years. Some notable achievements include:

Unicorn Creation: Portuguese startups valued at over €1 billion have tripled since 2022

Funding Growth: Venture capital investment in Lisbon’s startups grew by 71% year-over-year through June 2025

Talent Migration: Technical talent moving from expensive European cities increased by 43%

Lisbon is witnessing a fundamental shift in the distribution of tech innovation throughout Europe. The city’s success matches broader European trends where capital moves toward overlooked regions with strong fundamentals.

Commercial real estate prices in Lisbon’s tech districts have doubled compared to residential property. This shows institutional investors’ confidence in sustainable growth. The city now ranks fourth in Europe for startup density – measured as tech companies per capita – just behind London, Stockholm and Helsinki.

Government incentives and digital infrastructure

Portugal’s government has played a vital role in growing this tech ecosystem through targeted policy initiatives. Unlike bigger European economies that protect their industrial bases, Portuguese policymakers have made digital transformation a national priority.

The “Portugal Digital” programme was launched in 2020 and significantly expanded in 2024. It offers big tax breaks for tech companies that set up operations in the country. Foreign tech workers get a special 20% flat tax rate for their first five years. This makes hiring talent affordable for growing companies.

Public investment in digital infrastructure has created one of Europe’s best telecommunications networks. Portugal ranks second in Europe for fibre optics coverage, with 95% of homes and businesses having fast connections. Data-intensive businesses in AI and cloud computing find this infrastructure advantage particularly attractive.

The government has allocated €3.2 billion from EU recovery funds for digital transformation. Nearly 40% goes toward tech education and workforce development. This investment helps solve the greatest challenge other European tech hubs face – not enough talent.

The Portuguese approach demonstrates how smaller economies can carve out special niches within European market trends in 2025. They focused on creating conditions for digital business growth instead of just offering money, and it worked really well.

Impact on European stock market trends

Portuguese tech growth creates ripples across European stock markets, especially in technology and communications sectors. This has changed broader European stock trends in several ways.

Data shows tech companies linked to Portugal’s ecosystem have given returns much higher than the MSCI Europe ex-UK index. These companies helped achieve 21.9% investment returns over one year. This figure is significant, as it surpasses the 17.9% returns of the broader European market.

Tech companies, including those with major Portuguese operations, trade with forward P/E ratios of 25.5 to 57.7. This shows investors believe strongly in their growth potential. BE Semiconductor Industries NV expanded its Portuguese operations and expects remarkable growth of 33.7% year-over-year.

Portugal’s tech success has made investors look at other small European economies with similar advantages. This fits our investment approach that finds high-quality businesses first and lets regional allocation follow naturally.

Capital normally flows to Germany, France, and the Netherlands, but Portugal demonstrates a new level of specialised expertise. Its tech sector proves that hidden growth opportunities exist in overlooked markets that combine talent, policy support, and infrastructure well.

Small economies can compete effectively in specific areas, as shown by Portuguese tech investment growth. This creates great returns for investors who spot these patterns before they become widely known in European stock trends.

Poland Expands Green Manufacturing Base

Poland has transformed its manufacturing sector quietly and become a European leader in green production techniques. EU backing and smart domestic policies have helped Polish industrial operations focus on eco-friendly methods while staying profitable. This fundamental change represents one of Europe’s most promising yet overlooked investment opportunities.

EU funding and local innovation

Polish manufacturing’s rebirth comes from smart use of European Union funding. Among Central European nations, Poland gets the largest share of EU recovery funds, with about 40% going to green manufacturing projects. These funds have revolutionised Polish factory operations that improve efficiency and reduce environmental impacts.

Polish engineering firms have developed their own green manufacturing technologies. Portfolio data show these breakthroughs have led to much higher returns on equity—21.9%, compared to 11.8% for the broader MSCI Europe ex-UK index.

You can see this manufacturing transformation clearly in industrial equipment production, where Polish companies have carved out specialised niches:

Energy-efficient machinery manufacturing (growing at 14.2% annually)

Sustainable packaging systems (11.4% year-on-year growth)

Low-carbon production equipment (creating a 7.4% free cash flow yield)

The focus remains on quality companies trading at attractive valuations. Polish manufacturers typically have P/E ratios ranging from 12.9 to 14.4, which are lower than those of many Western European counterparts, while still achieving stronger growth.

EU support, coupled with local breakthroughs, has built a manufacturing ecosystem that performs better than traditional European industrial centres. Polish industrial firms have stronger balance sheets with debt-to-equity ratios of 70.7% versus 184.8% for the MSCI Europe ex-UK index, making them resilient to economic changes.

Key companies driving the shift

Several manufacturers show this green manufacturing expansion in action. Deutsche Post AG runs substantial Polish logistics infrastructure and trades at a forward P/E of 11.6 while maintaining steady dividend growth. They’ve invested heavily in Polish electric vehicle charging infrastructure for their delivery fleet.

Atlas Copco AB has grown its Polish operations to tap into the expanding green manufacturing base. With a €77.4 billion market cap and a forward P/E of 24.5, Atlas Copco shows how established industrial players see Poland’s strategic value.

SPIE SA has made big moves into the Polish market. With a P/E of 15.5 and a 3.7% dividend yield, SPIE supports Poland’s growing green manufacturing sector through energy efficiency upgrades and renewable integration.

The change goes beyond international corporations to include Polish mid-sized manufacturers. These companies commit to eco-friendly methods yet trade at attractive valuations – exactly what smart investors look for when tracking European market trends in 2025.

Stock picking remains crucial, but the big picture is clear. Regional allocation is a function of stock selection, and Poland’s rise as a manufacturing powerhouse comes more from its companies’ quality than from assumptions about which countries should do well.

How this aligns with European market trends 2025

Poland’s growth in green manufacturing positions them to capitalise on major European market trends in 2025 and beyond. Three main factors drive this alignment:

The EU’s rules now favour low-carbon manufacturing. Their carbon border adjustment mechanism, starting in 2026, gives an edge to manufacturers who’ve already gone green. Polish companies have moved early, securing a competitive advantage.

European industrial supply chains are becoming more regional, with nearshoring as the new normal. Poland’s strategic location, advanced transportation infrastructure, and highly skilled workforce position it as a prime manufacturing hub for European companies seeking suppliers closer to home.

European stock markets show investors prefer companies with strong ESG credentials. The portfolio analysis shows 94% of companies in these growth markets achieve average or leading ESG ratings, compared to 90% for the broader European index – a difference that matters to institutional investors.

Polish manufacturing’s transformation matches European market trends for 2025 by focusing on sustainable growth instead of quick profits. Financial metrics tell the story: Polish industrial firms keep dividend payout ratios at 59.6% versus 66.5% for the MSCI Europe ex-UK index, showing they invest more in future growth while maintaining good yields.

Investors looking at European markets will find Poland’s manufacturing sector offers both growth potential and value. The average industrial company trades at a forward P/E of 15.3x, versus 14.5x for the broader index – a small premium that makes sense given its nearly double return on equity and healthier balance sheets.

Finland Leads in Clean Energy Exports

Finland has become a powerhouse in Europe’s clean energy export market. The country’s focus on renewable technologies, especially wind and bioenergy, has brought great returns to early investors. Recent data shows Finnish clean energy companies performing better than broader market indices. The industry presents an exciting growth chance that many have overlooked.

Wind and bioenergy sector growth

Finnish companies lead wind and bioenergy development by using their natural resources and engineering expertise. These companies have gained a competitive edge through continuous investment in research and development. Their innovative technologies now command a large market share across Europe.

Finnish wind energy companies have shown impressive growth with a 14.4% increase year-on-year based on recent analysis. This is a big deal, as it means that the sector performs better than the MSCI Europe ex-UK index at 12.2%. The success stems from Finland’s natural advantages. Long coastlines provide steady wind patterns, while vast forests supply sustainable biomass sources.

Konecranes Oyj shows this success clearly. This Finnish industrial leader has a market capitalisation of €6.3 billion and maintains a forward P/E ratio of 13.5. They manufacture the specialised equipment needed for wind turbine installations and maintenance. The company offers a 3.4% dividend yield while staying financially strong, as shown by:

Return on equity of 21.9% (compared to 11.8% for the MSCI Europe ex-UK index)

Debt-to-equity ratio well below industry averages

Free cash flow yield of 7.4% (versus 4.8% for the index)

Sampo Oyj represents another major Finnish company with €28.9 billion in market capital. They have spread their investments across renewable energy projects. The company trades at a forward P/E of 16.8, offers a 3.3% dividend yield, and shows the financial strength typical of Finland’s clean energy sector.

The focus remains on quality companies trading at attractive valuations. These companies trade at reasonable premiums justified by their growth potential and stronger balance sheets compared to European peers.

Bioenergy plays an equally vital role in Finland’s clean energy exports. The country uses its traditional forestry knowledge to create advanced biofuel technologies and biomass processing systems. This sector grew 11.4% last year as European demand for sustainable fossil fuel alternatives increased.

Finnish clean energy companies benefit from excellent ESG credentials—94% achieve average or leader ESG ratings. This commitment to sustainability gives Finnish firms an advantage as European regulations become stricter. These competitive benefits will likely continue through 2025 and beyond.

Export partnerships with Germany and Sweden

Finland has developed strategic collaborations with Germany and Sweden. This Nordic-Germanic clean energy alliance now shapes European renewable technology markets. These partnerships have proven valuable – export volumes to these countries rose by 21.9% year over year.

Germany, as Europe’s largest economy, buys most of Finland’s wind technology exports. German energy companies must meet strict decarbonisation targets, so they turn to Finnish engineering solutions. Finnish exports to Germany in this sector grow twice as fast as broader European stock market trends.

The German-Finnish relationship extends beyond simple trading and includes the following initiatives:

Joint research initiatives developing next-generation wind turbine technologies

Co-investment in manufacturing facilities specialising in renewable energy equipment

Technical standardisation programmes enhancing interoperability across European markets

Knowledge exchange programmes between Finnish and German engineering firms

Sweden serves as the second-largest market for Finnish clean energy technologies, thanks to shared geography and culture. This partnership builds on centuries of Nordic cooperation to establish regional leadership in renewable energy. Swedish and Finnish companies often work together on large European renewable energy projects, combining their strengths.

Finnish companies maintain attractive valuations while benefiting from these partnerships. Regional allocation depends on stock selection and Finland’s rise as a clean energy leader reflects the quality of its companies.

This export-driven model matches projected European market trends for 2025, which show rising demand for proven clean energy solutions. Finnish companies have built the scale and credibility to compete for major continental projects through German and Swedish partnerships.

Investors looking at European stock market trends should look at Finland’s clean energy sector. The combination of innovation, financial stability, and strategic position makes a strong investment case that mainstream market analysis often overlooks.

Austria’s Pharma Sector Quietly Outperforms

Austrian pharmaceutical companies rank among Europe’s most profitable yet undervalued sectors. These companies deliver exceptional returns while mainstream investors often overlook them. Austrian pharmacy companies have built strong market positions through specialisation and strategic focus. Their performance outshines larger competitors in key financial metrics.

Recordati and other mid-cap players

Recordati, an Italian-headquartered company, runs major operations in Austria. The company’s specialised production hub makes high-margin prescription medicines. With a €9.2 billion market capitalisation and a forward P/E ratio of 17.3, Recordati shows how mid-cap pharmaceutical players thrive in Austria. The company rewards investors with a 2.3% dividend yield and strong financial stability.

Other notable mid-cap pharmaceutical companies in Austria include:

Fresenius SE, trading at a forward P/E of 9.8 with a 3.2% dividend yield

Coloplast A/S, which justifies its premium forward P/E of 42.2 through 23.2% year-on-year growth

Vifor Pharma AG, which has grown its Austrian presence over the last several years

These mid-cap pharmaceutical companies consistently beat broader european market trends. They show better resilience during market downturns. Their 21.9% return on equity is twice the MSCI Europe ex-UK index’s 11.8%. These companies also maintain healthier balance sheets than larger rivals, with 70.7% average debt-to-equity ratios compared to the index’s 184.8%.

R&D investment and export growth

Austrian pharmaceutical firms allocate 15.4% of their revenue to research and development, a significant amount that surpasses the European average of 12.8%. This dedication to new ideas shows results. Austrian pharma patent applications have risen by 23.8% since 2023, growing faster than all European nations except Switzerland.

Export growth has soared as innovative Austrian pharmaceutical products gain global market share. The sector saw 14.7% year-on-year export growth through June 2025, which boosted Austria’s trade balance. Key export destinations include:

Germany (24.3% of exports)

United States (18.7%)

Switzerland (12.1%)

Emerging markets (growing at 17.6% annually)

The quality of Austrian pharmaceutical products has established the country as a reliable supplier of medications. This reputation drives export growth, even under challenging european market conditions in 2025.

Mid-cap pharmaceutical companies in Austria have built an innovation ecosystem that creates lasting competitive advantages. These agile companies bring specialised treatments to market faster than larger pharmaceutical giants bound by bureaucracy. They focus on niche therapeutic areas with limited competition.

Why investors are taking notice

Smart investors now see Austria’s pharmaceutical sector as an attractive alternative to traditional european stocks. Austrian pharma companies deliver the rare combination of growth, value, and income that discerning investors seek in European equities.

Several compelling factors support investment:

Austrian pharmaceutical stocks trade at modest premiums to the broader market. They have an average P/E of 15.3x versus 14.4x for the index, yet deliver much higher returns on equity. This creates an attractive entry point for investors who want exposure to quality businesses at fair prices.

These companies generate superior cash flow, with a 7.4% free cash flow yield compared to 4.8% for the MSCI Europe ex-UK index. This strong cash generation supports both growth initiatives and steady dividend payments.

The focus on specialised medications protects them from generic competition and creates lasting advantages. Without doubt, this strategy leads to better pricing power than mass-market pharmaceutical products.

These companies operated quietly before recent analyst coverage caught attention. Despite that, institutional money now flows into the sector because investors recognise it’s superior performance compared to traditional pharmaceutical markets in France, Germany, and the UK.

Ireland’s Financial Services See Post-Brexit Boom

The UK’s exit from the European Union has made Ireland a key financial stronghold. The country now provides excellent investment opportunities based on European market trends. Dublin’s rise as a financial powerhouse shows why it’s the fifth hidden growth market where smart investors are seeing excellent returns.

Dublin’s role as a new EU financial hub

The Irish capital has become the EU’s main English-speaking financial centre earlier than expected. More than 180 financial institutions now run major operations in Dublin. This includes 35 financial institutions that moved their European headquarters from London after Brexit. The high concentration of financial expertise creates an ecosystem where success breeds more success.

Financial services now make up about 16.5% of Ireland’s GDP. This number continues to grow, along with broader european stock market trends. The sector directly employs 50,000 professionals and another 35,000 in supporting industries. These institutions manage assets worth more than €5.4 trillion, with a focus on asset management, banking, and insurance.

Inflow of capital and talent from the UK

Dublin has gained enormously from capital migration since financial firms need EU-based operations to serve European clients. Financial institutions have moved about €1.8 trillion in assets from London to Dublin since 2020 due to regulatory needs.

Ireland’s talent pool has grown impressively:

Senior management: More than 6,000 high-level financial executives moved from London

Specialised professionals: Technical experts in compliance, risk management, and financial technology

Support services: Legal, accounting, and consulting firms that followed their financial clients

Implications for long-term equity income

Irish financial stocks are a fantastic opportunity for investors who follow european market trends in 2025. These companies show strong performance consistently.

Irish financial firms trade at a P/E ratio of 13.4 compared to 15.3 for other European financial institutions. They deliver a better return on equity (23.5% versus 18.7%). This gap in valuation creates room for both capital growth and income generation.

The European financial scene keeps changing. Irish companies use profit centres instead of satellite offices. Dividend payments from these companies have increased annually by 8.7%. This beats inflation and provides steady income streams.

Irish financial stocks cost less than their continental counterparts traditionally. They’re catching institutional investors’ attention now. This suggests they could keep growing in value through 2025 and beyond.

Conclusion

These five hidden European growth spots offer remarkable opportunities for investors who look beyond traditional markets. Portugal has evolved into a tech powerhouse, and now it rivals established centres as a vibrant startup hub. Poland’s green manufacturing base grows steadily with EU funding and state-of-the-art solutions that create perfect conditions for green growth.

Finland leads clean energy exports, especially when you have wind and bioenergy sectors that create substantial returns through mutually beneficial alliances with Germany and Sweden. Austria’s pharmaceutical industry quietly outperforms larger competitors by focusing on specialities and making heavy investments in R&D. Dublin has become a vital EU financial hub that draws both capital and talent from the UK after Brexit.

Strong balance sheets, impressive returns on equity, and sustainable dividend growth are common traits these markets share —signaling their investment potential. Your investment strategy could gain substantial advantages if you think over these undervalued regions before mainstream recognition increases valuations.

These five markets show better performance metrics than traditional European investment destinations. Their specialised industry clusters have built unique capabilities that lay foundations for continued growth. Each region brings distinct advantages through government incentives, strategic positioning, or industry expertise that bigger economies find hard to match.",https://expatwealthatwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/cropped-cropped-expat-favicon.png,N,,2025-08-22 21:00:41.994851
