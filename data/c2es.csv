Global sales of electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles rose 24% in May compared with the same period a year ago, as strength in China offset slower growth in North America, according to market research firm Rho Motion.

Electric vehicle sales in China surpassed over one million units in a single month for the first time this year, driven by strong domestic demand and targeted export efforts from Chinese manufacturers, notably BYD, tapping into emerging markets.

BYD's exports to Mexico and Southeast Asia, along with Uzbekistan, have significantly boosted sales in these regions, Rho Motion data manager Charles Lester said.

Fleet incentives in Germany and robust growth in Southern Europe helped lift the European market, while the expiry of Canadian subsidies dragged on North American demand, he added.

WHY IT'S IMPORTANT

Global automakers face a 25% import tariff in the United States, the world's second-largest car market, causing many of them to withdraw their outlooks for 2025.

In Europe, new incentives for fleet buyers in Germany are expected to support electric car sales through the second half of the year.

Tesla's Model Y production in Berlin shields it from tariffs, yet it faces market share pressures as production ramps up globally amidst shifting trade tensions.

President Donald Trump's stance towards emissions standards and uncertainties around tariffs has also hampered EV growth in North America.

In the U.S., tax credits for EVs are still available but will begin phasing out from 2026, contributing to hesitation among buyers.

BY THE NUMBERS

Global sales of battery-electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids rose to 1.6 million units in May, Rho Motion data showed.

Sales in China grew more than 24% from the same month last year to 1.02 million vehicles.

Scout is an EV manufacturer preparing to launch two models – an SUV and a pick-up truck – in 2027.

AAM will supply the front EDUs and rear e-beam axles for both the Traveler SUV and Terra pick-up truck, which will be built on a common body-on-frame chassis. The value and scope of the supply agreement were not disclosed.

A front electric drive unit (EDU, or e-axle) converts electrical energy from the battery into mechanical energy to drive the front wheels. An e-beam axle, or e-axle, is a beam axle that incorporates an electric motor, inverters, and transmission into a single unit to drive the rear wheels.

While the Scout vehicles will be 100-percent battery powered, they will incorporate a small gas engine that will function as a generator to charge the battery, known as an “extended-range electric vehicle” (EREV) option.

Detroit-based American Axle is a Tier One automotive supplier that develops and manufactures driveline technologies and systems for electric, hybrid, and internal-combustion engine vehicles. its products include axles, driveshafts, differentials, clutch modules, and disconnecting driveline systems. It also operates an extensive metal-forming business, with forging operations that produce components for engines, transmissions, drivelines, and other parts.

Scout Motors is building a $2-billion manufacturing complex in Blythewood, S.C. The company is backed by Volkswagen Group AG and the vehicles will adopt software and electrical architecture from Rivian Motors, though it is an independent company. The brand and styling are intended to evoke the series of four-wheel-drive vehicles that International Harvester produced from 1961 to 1980. VW acquired Navistar, International Harvester’s successor company, in 2021.

“We are honored to support the rebirth of the iconic Scout brand and play a significant role in these important vehicle launches with AAM’s award-winning electric drive technology,” stated AAM chairman and CEO David C.

Hundreds of thousands of jobs could be lost each year by removing incentives for clean energy investment, the majority in sectors not directly related to clean energy.","In Brief:

Cuts to energy programs in the House ""big beautiful bill"" could slow clean energy innovation and deployment, according to a recent report.

Impacts on state economies could be significant.

Modeling by energy analysts attempts to bring economic consequences into focus. Risks are high in both red and blue states.

Cost cutting was a guiding principle for the “big beautiful bill” that squeaked through the House in May and went to the Senate for review. But modeling by analysts at the nonpartisan think tank Energy Innovation highlights the ways energy provisions in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act could prove expensive for states.

As it now stands, the bill would slow energy deployment and manufacturing over the next 10 years, say the analysts in a new report. The bill proposes taking back unobligated clean energy funds from Inflation Reduction Act programs, eliminating tax credits for clean energy development and manufacturing, and imposing new registration fees for owners of electric and hybrid vehicles.

These changes could mean the loss of 330 gigawatts of new electricity generation capacity between now and 2035 — as much energy as would come from 165 new Hoover dams. Wind power would be the most affected (see chart). Red states have been the leaders in making energy from wind, with Texas producing more than twice as much as any other.

This loss of capacity is a problem at a time when artificial intelligence alone is expected to increase data center power demand by as much as 160 percent by 2030, according to Goldman Sachs. Elimination of clean energy tax credits threatens more than $321 billion in announced private investments in energy and manufacturing. The bill expands oil and gas leasing, but new gas power plants aren’t being built at the same rate as solar and wind, says Megan Mahajan, one of the report authors.

“All the major gas turbine manufacturers have delivery backlogs until at least 2029,” she says. “If you’re thinking about being able to meet rising electricity demand with new sources, it’s really important to get wind and solar online.”

Mahajan and her colleagues also modeled the impact of the bill on jobs. Projects announced on the basis of tax credits face uncertainty. Hundreds of thousands of jobs could be lost each year by removing incentives for clean energy investment, the majority in sectors not directly related to clean energy.

Job losses would vary by state. “Some states have significant investments planned in clean energy technologies like batteries, which are really hit hard by the loss of manufacturing tax credits,” Mahajan says. Again, red states would be among the most affected, including Texas, Florida, North Carolina, Ohio and Indiana.

Solar and wind are the cheapest sources of electricity. Greater dependence on fossil fuels for electricity generation and the higher fossil fuel prices resulting from increased demand would cause household energy costs to increase, Mahajan says. Almost all the states among the 20 where families would see the greatest increases in their energy bills are Republican-led.

In combination, factors including rising household costs, cancellation of announced investments and projects, and job losses could have significant consequences for the country’s GDP. Energy Innovation’s modeling is based on an open source policy simulator that takes a wide range of consequences from the present One Big Beautiful Bill Act into account, including termination of a clean vehicle tax credit and rising costs of fueling vehicles with internal combustion engines.

“If you look cumulatively at the impacts on a national level it will cut national GDP by over a trillion dollars,” Mahajan says. The cumulative GDP loss over the next 10 years will amount to tens of billions in many states (see map).

Republicans have long been opposed to former President Joe Biden's Inflation Reduction Act. No Republican in the House or Senate voted for it. Estimates of its fiscal costs range from $800 million to more than $1 trillion over a decade, a ripe target in a policy climate focused on cutting expenditures. President Donald Trump's budget proposal aims to eliminate funding for a ""Green New Scam,"" referencing ""unreliable renewable energy"" and other costly technologies that ""burden ratepayers and consumers.""

Energy Innovation's modeling likely understates potential impacts, Mahajan says, using conservative estimates for the demand in electricity growth. It doesn’t encompass the full costs of climate impacts, including health effects, investments never made or ceding leadership in clean energy innovation and export to China. China’s exports of advanced energy technology to developing countries, for example, are already 10 times greater than those from the U.S. and grew by more than 100 percent between 2018 and 2023.

“In a world where we see competitors like China going all in on clean energy, we don’t want to lose the momentum we’ve seen on this front,” Mahajan says.

Company last requested a regulatory review of rates in 2022

GREENVILLE, S.C., June 12, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Duke Energy Progress today asked South Carolina regulators to perform a public review of the company's current rates.

This is the company's first request to review rates since 2022. It comes as the company continues working to increase system diversity and reliability, enhance the customer experience and meet future energy demands.

Duke Energy Progress serves about 177,000 customers primarily in central and northeastern South Carolina.

By the numbers: The company's application in front of the Public Service Commission of South Carolina (PSCSC) requests an overall revenue increase of $74.8 million, which represents a 12.1% increase over current revenues.

If approved, monthly electric bills for typical residential customers using 1,000 kilowatt-hours per month would increase $21.66 a month – from $144.85 per month to $166.51 – effective Feb. 1, 2026. Commercial customers will see an average increase of 12.8% and industrial customers will see an average increase of around 3.6%. The amount of increase per customer class can vary based upon how much more additional revenue is needed to ensure that the class is covering the cost to serve them.

Why it matters: Duke Energy is committed to meeting customers' increasingly higher expectations around reliability, responsiveness, affordability and value.

This proposal reflects the investments we have made to strengthen the grid, improve storm readiness, maintain and enhance our generating fleet and serve a growing customer base.

It also reflects how the company is doing that work: with discipline, with a focus on operational excellence, and with a thoughtful approach to how and when we seek rate adjustments.

Investments in action: The company's grid investments have positioned it well for storm response.

For example, as Hurricane Helene made its way across the Carolinas, grid improvements were already helping to combat power outages from the storm.

Smart, self-healing technology installed across the Duke Energy Progress service territory helped to automatically restore more than 10,000 customer outages and saved more than 28,000 hours of total outage time, showing the value of the self-healing programs.

Our view:

""We know families and businesses are juggling a lot and we do not take a request to increase rates lightly but being upfront and timely with our request is the right thing to do and in the best interest of our customers."" – Tim Pearson, Duke Energy's South Carolina president

Clean energy tax credits approved under the Biden administration are under debate in the Senate. House Republicans voted to gut these programs, but not all of their fellow Republicans in the Senate are on board. NPR's Barbara Sprunt has more.

BARBARA SPRUNT, BYLINE: President Trump has long talked about his frustrations with clean energy provisions signed into law by President Biden in the Inflation Reduction Act. Here he is at an April rally in Michigan.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: You know what I don't give approval to? Those stupid windmills that go round and round and round.

(BOOING)

TRUMP: And we've ended the green new scam.

SPRUNT: The House passed a bill that would accomplish much of President Trump's agenda, like extending the 2017 tax cuts. To help pay for that, it takes an axe to clean energy credits. The bill would roll back incentives for wind, solar and hydrogen power, phase out consumer tax credits for new electric vehicles and terminate some credits for projects that begin construction more than 60 days after the bill's enactment. But it would also impact a lot of business happening in primarily red states.

BOB KEEFE: If you look at the total investments by business, 80% of them have gone into Republican congressional districts. So this isn't happening in California or New York. These aren't, you know, tree huggers or environmentalists getting hurt. It's workers in red states.

SPRUNT: That's Bob Keefe, Executive Director of E2, a nonpartisan pro-environment business group that's been tracking clean energy projects for over two years.

KEEFE: We've seen $14 billion worth of new factories and other projects - you know, clean energy, electric vehicle-related plants, solar projects, wind projects, battery projects - canceled in America because of the uncertainty over this bill.

SPRUNT: In April, four Republican senators sent a letter to Senate leadership saying a significant repeal of credits in place from the IRA could jeopardize job creation in the energy sector. Utah's John Curtis was one of them.

JOHN CURTIS: I think it's really important that Senate Republicans - and, I wish, House Republicans - look at this not from the standpoint of it's in the IRA, therefore it's bad, but rather, what is in the country's best interest and what is the best tax policy?

SPRUNT: He said credits should be analyzed individually to evaluate merit and that if credits are eliminated, how they go is important, both for consumers and for businesses.

CURTIS: If we're closing these down, let's just do it in a way that takes into account those employees at those businesses, the banks that loaned on those projects and make sure we have business certainty.

SPRUNT: He says his phone has been ringing off the hook with people concerned about the Senate's next steps.

CURTIS: I would say more than we can meet with.

SPRUNT: Senators aren't only hearing from lobbyists and industry leaders. They're also getting entreated by their Republican counterparts in the House.

ROB BRESNAHAN: We had some good conversations with a handful of senators.

SPRUNT: That's Congressman Rob Bresnahan of Pennsylvania, one of 13 House Republicans who are urging the Senate to substantially change the energy provisions that they voted for.

BRESNAHAN: You know, I'm OK with the phase-out but giving enough runway for projects that have already been committed and pledged to be completed before having the rug ripped out from, essentially, underneath them.

SPRUNT: Senate Finance Committee ranking member Ron Wyden, a Democrat, said he's optimistic that progress is being made among his GOP colleagues.

RON WYDEN: What I'm doing is going literally senator by senator of those who support innovation or, you know, understand that clean energy helps to create more competition and choice, which is also a kind of Republican idea.

SPRUNT: But in Congress, you make one group happy, and it crosses another group's red line. Once the Senate passes the bill, it then goes back to the House, and some members there have already said if the Senate waters down those clean energy rollbacks, they'll vote no.

A group of 13 House Republicans sent a letter to their Senate counterparts Friday asking the Senate to make further alterations to changes made to the Inflation Reduction Act’s clean energy tax credits, as the chamber takes up its portion of the budget reconciliation process.

The Republicans were led by Virginia Rep. Jen Kiggans, who said in a June 6 press release that though she supported the House-passed “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” as it stands, “there remains significant room for improvement in preserving the clean energy tax credits.”

The requested changes largely mirror those requested by Kiggans and her colleagues prior to the House’s passage of the bill. The group’s letter cites more than $14 billion in clean energy projects that have been canceled this year, with signatories stating that “project cancellations will continue to snowball” if Congress does not provide “business certainty as these provisions are phased out.”

Dive Insight:

Kiggans and a nearly identical group of House Republicans wrote to their House colleagues last month seeking positive changes to the clean energy tax credit phaseout plan that came out of committee work on the reconciliation bill. Instead, the House-passed version of the bill imposes a faster phaseout timeline, including a repeal of tax credits for projects that don’t begin construction within 60 days of the bill’s enactment.

The Republican lawmakers in support of IRA’s clean energy credits asked that the Senate alter that provision — along with a foreign entity of concern provision that was again called “overly prescriptive” — and maintain tax credit transferability throughout the credits’ lifetime. The group said that though they were “proud to have worked to ensure that the bill did not include a full repeal of the clean energy tax credits,” they remain “deeply concerned about those provisions.”

The tax credit phaseout schedule included in the House-passed bill, “would cause significant disruption to projects under development and stop investments needed to win the global energy race,” the letter said. The lawmakers said the overall approach to the tax credit changes “jeopardizes ongoing development, discourages long-term investment, and could significantly delay or cancel energy infrastructure projects across the country.”

The group recommended the 60-day timeline and the bill’s “placed in service” standard should be replaced with a “commence construction” requirement. The group said that due to permitting delays and other issues outside of project developers’ control, it is hard for the businesses to be sure when their projects will be “placed in service.” Swapping that language with a “commence construction” provision would give companies more flexibility to understand if they are eligible for certain credits and give “the investment clarity and lead time required for energy projects to succeed,” according to the Republican lawmakers.

“Our position has always been that the energy tax code should be modernized in a way that promotes fiscal responsibility and business certainty,” the letter said. “Fully realizing that balance requires improvements to the House-passed version of … the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.”

Kiggins was joined on the letter by Reps.

The suite of investment, production and residential tax credits enacted and expanded under the Democrats’ own big budget reconciliation bill in 2022, titled the “Inflation Reduction Act,” incentivized homeowners, car buyers, energy producers and manufacturers to invest in types of energy beyond fossil fuels, with the aim of reducing the effects of climate change.

The credits have spurred hundreds of billions in investment dollars in advanced manufacturing and production since 2022, and contributed to job creation, largely in states that elected President Donald Trump to a second term.

Small business operators and community leaders from rural and mountainous areas of the United States that have benefited from the boom in alternative energy sources say the campaign to end the tax credits will also cause job losses and cut options for consumers.

Solar projects in Alaska

Chase Christie, director of development for Alaska Solar LLC, said his company installs four to five large-scale solar projects per year in remote Alaskan villages and also fits and services smaller residential solar installations.

“They take a lot of planning, a lot of logistics,” Christie told States Newsroom in an interview Wednesday.

“For going into a remote village where there's tundra, we might need to go there in the dead of winter so we can work on frozen ground,” he added. “Other places we won't go until summer. So we have these large gaps in between these larger projects, and a company like ours absolutely relies on the residential installations to keep our workforce going.”

Christie, who met Tuesday with staffers for Alaska’s Republican Sens. Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan, said in January he let a handful of workers go and paused most new hiring.

“Our workforce is roughly half of what it usually is just because we're not sure which direction things are going to go,” he said.

Christie was among a dozen small energy business owners, municipal government officials and nonprofit employees focused on energy options for low-income households who States Newsroom spoke to Wednesday.

A spokesperson for Sullivan said in a statement: “Senator Sullivan supports energy projects that lower costs for Alaska. The Senator and his team have been meeting with a number of Alaskans about energy tax credits. As we wait for text from the Senate Finance Committee, the Senator is working with his colleagues to ensure that the bill strikes the right balance between promoting stable and predictable tax policy, advancing projects that benefit Alaska, and addressing the need to reduce the federal deficit.”

Murkowski’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Elimination of tax credits

Senators are hashing out language for the massive Republican agenda bill that will extend and expand the 2017 tax law, costing roughly $3.8 trillion, and cut spending in other areas to offset the price tag.

A contingent of House Republicans, who have dubbed the tax credits the “green new scam,” won on accelerating the expiration of the energy tax credits and tightening restrictions on eligibility as a way to pay for individual and corporate tax cuts that Trump campaigned on.

The language in a section of the House bill, passed 215-214 on May 22, titled “Working Families Over Elites,” terminates the Energy Efficient Home Improvement Tax Credit, worth up to $3,200 for homeowners who make energy upgrades to their property.

Among the slate of other affected IRA tax credits, the House bill also speeds up the expiration of the Clean Electricity Investment Tax Credit, a credit dating back decades that was updated in 2022.

The credit is available to taxpayers who invest in “energy property,” including solar installations to provide electricity and heat, fuel cells, small wind turbines, geothermal pumps, and other electricity-producing technologies.

House Republicans wrote provisions to eliminate the credit for facilities placed into service after 2028 and end eligibility for projects that don’t begin construction within 60 days of the bill’s enactment.

The credit is worth up to 30% of the cost of the project, plus two bonus credits up to 10% each if the project includes mostly domestically produced material and if it’s located in an “energy community,” meaning a place where a coal plant has closed or where unemployment reaches a certain threshold.

The bill also repeals a taxpayer’s ability to transfer the tax credits as a way to finance a project, and introduces restrictions on foreign-made components that industry professionals say essentially makes the credit unworkable.

Critics point to the cost of the tax credits.

The nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimated, as of June 4, the elimination of the clean energy investment and production tax credits will save roughly $249 billion over the next decade.

Alex Muresianu, senior policy analyst at the Tax Foundation, a right-of-center think tank that advocates for lower taxes, said Thursday in a new analysis that “The final House bill makes impressive cuts to the IRA green energy tax credits, but it does so in part by introducing more complexity.”

The group is advocating for senators to reduce the tax credit rates and make clearer complicated language, like the provision around “foreign entities of concern.”

Keeping on the heat during a Montana winter

But Logan Smith, weatherization program manager for the Human Resource Development Council in central Montana, argues the credits have been a lifeline for lower-income rural residents.

“If I can get solar panels on each of the clients’ homes, that means that their power is going to stay on in the middle of winter,” Smith said. “Because every winter we plan for losing power for about a week, that's just something we grew up with. … But if we have solar panels, the power stays on, the heat stays on.”

Ralph Waters, owner of SBS Solar in Missoula, Montana, became emotional when talking about how an early termination of the tax credits could slow his business and result in having to lay off half his workforce.

He criticized the politicization of the tax incentives.

“Montana is deeply red, but it's also a very practical place. And so green energy renewables becomes a taboo phrase somehow,” Waters said. “The practical energy needs are undeniable, and so if we can get past our disagreements about the phraseology and realize that it's electrons, watts, and amps. And it’s cheaper.”

President Donald Trump and Republicans in the House and Senate on Thursday finally ended California’s outsized authority to dictate national emissions standards for new cars, trucks, RVs and engines.

This win is another step toward rebuilding American manufacturing strength.

The EPA, under President Joe Biden, granted California exemption waivers to the Clean Air Act, handing California the keys to set their own extreme emissions regulations – including the requirement that nearly all vehicles sold in the state must be electric by 2035.

Knowing that the people’s representatives in Congress would reject their most extreme policies, the Biden administration had to rely on these workarounds to push their Green New Scam agenda.

CALIFORNIA'S GREEN NEW SCAM COULD COST YOU $20,000

Biden’s Clean Air Act waiver allowed other states to follow California’s lead, creating a patchwork of misguided rules. More than a dozen states and D.C. follow California’s standards, drastically changing the dynamics of America’s critical auto and RV manufacturing industry without Congress having a say.

In practice, this means California effectively set the standards for the automotive industry, and most Americans have been forced to live under a regulatory framework that none of our representatives ever voted on.

This ends now. Rep. Yakym, R-Ind., along with House Republicans, took action to end this power grab, passing three disapproval resolutions under the Congressional Review Act (CRA) to repeal the EPA waivers. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., shepherded these three measures through the Senate, which today earned President Trump’s signature.

Republicans across the country knew there was no time to waste. Beginning this year, California’s Advanced Clean Trucks regulations would have started requiring new heavy-duty vehicles, such as trucks and RVs, to be zero-emission. This regulation threatened the RV supply chain by limiting the availability of chassis for motor homes.

THE PREDICTABLE OUTCOME OF CALIFORNIA’S GREEN ENERGY POLICIES HAS ARRIVED AND IT'S A DISASTER

Eleven states and D.C. adopted this mandate, which impacts 25% of the heavy-duty vehicle market in the United States, essentially making it the new national standard.

The stakes couldn’t be higher for the Hoosier State, especially Indiana’s Second District, home to Rep. Yakym and the RV Capital of the World, where nearly 90% of America’s RVs are built. This industry directly supports more than 60,000 Hoosier jobs, pays over $4.3 billion in wages, and generates a total economic output of $22 billion across the state.

RV production is also critical to many other states which is why 13 Democrats joined Republicans in the bipartisan, commonsense vote against the Biden EPA’s RV waiver.

Reversing California’s emissions power grab is essential to RV, automotive and engine manufacturing industries in the state of Indiana and across America.

The Clean Air Act was never intended to effectively give one state the power to dictate emissions standards for entire industries across the country. Congress prohibited states from establishing separate vehicle and engine regulations except under ""compelling and extraordinary conditions"" that apply specifically to that state.

We’ve seen this before. As a U.S. senator, Gov. Braun used the Congressional Review Act to stop Biden’s vaccine mandate for private businesses, a fight that ended with the Supreme Court striking it down. The CRA exists for moments like this, an expedited option to rein in the executive branch, reverse unnecessary red tape and prohibit substantially similar EPA actions in the future.

Hardworking Hoosiers shouldn’t have to bear the weight of federal overreach. National rules should be set by the people’s elected representatives, not by unelected regulators or one state’s agenda.

Over the past decade, many state governments have set aggressive renewable energy mandates regarding the adoption of grid-scale wind and solar power generation systems and the shuttering of fossil fuel generators. Whether these policy mandates were well-intentioned or the result of foreign influence operations designed to undermine US energy security, most states are meeting their targets.

The closing of baseload power generators, like coal plants, and the simultaneous deep penetration of wind and solar power generation systems have introduced risks to electric grid reliability. These risks were seen first-hand in the 2025 Iberian Peninsula blackout, which caused widespread outages in Spain and Portugal and which was triggered by sub-synchronous oscillations and subsequent sub-synchronous resonance from an over-reliance on inverter-based renewable systems.

Recently, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) — the Electric Reliability Organization (ERO), which is designated by Congress to manage America’s bulk power system (BPS) — released its “2025 Summer Reliability Assessment” with the statement that “Operators in many parts of the BPS face challenges in meeting higher demand this summer with a resource mix that, in general, has less flexibility and more variability.”

That’s a very polite way of warning that the “resource mix” — i.e., too much wind and solar and not enough baseload power generation — is a problem.

The report pointed out elevated risk areas (found in the following document), which is where there is a “potential for insufficient operating reserves in above-normal conditions.”

What the report did not cover are the supply chain and security risks associated with the tremendous adoption of these wind and solar systems.

Supply Chain Concerns

America’s huge push to adopt grid-scale wind and solar systems has also led us to import massive amounts of this infrastructure from a hostile nation that has been hacking our infrastructure for many years — China.

The International Energy Agency reports that China dominates eighty to ninety-five percent of global solar photovoltaic (PV) supply chains and controls the production of the critical inverters often bundled with solar and wind systems. According to the Washington Post, the United States imports approximately eighty percent of its solar components and seventy percent of its grid-scale battery energy storage systems (BESS) from China or Chinese-affiliated suppliers.

A December 2021 report by retired US Army Command Sergeant Major Michael Mabee for the Secure-the-Grid Coalition revealed that the United States imported 171,288,538 Chinese inverters from 2002 to October 2021, and the numbers are only rising.

A 2024 report by the Department of Energy (DOE) projects a 47.6% annual rise in inverter-based power generation through 2035, potentially leading to a forty-nine-fold increase in Chinese inverters embedded in the US grid if current wind and solar energy investments are not reversed.

Security Concerns

National security experts have repeatedly warned federal regulators about the cybersecurity risks associated with importing hardware from adversarial nations like China. Internationally renowned control system cybersecurity expert Joseph Weiss has emphasized that Chinese-made BESSs, integral to storing energy from wind and solar power, are highly susceptible to cyberattacks, with many capable of communicating directly with servers in China. This vulnerability creates a pathway for adversaries to disrupt the grid, potentially inducing blackouts or worse.

The first Trump Administration took security warnings seriously after discovering a Chinese-manufactured transformer with a “hardware backdoor” — declaring a “grid security emergency” on May 1, 2020, and issuing Executive Order 13920: “Securing the United States Bulk-Power System.” Hoping that federal regulators would align grid protection standards with this order, the Secure the Grid Coalition filed a formal, docketed complaint with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), only to have it denied less than six months later. Three months after that, President Biden suspended Executive Order 13920 on his first day in office.

According to data from the U.S. Census Bureau, the number of Chinese-manufactured transformers imported into the U.S. rose from 300 in 2020 to 554 in February 2025.

Data Source: U.S. Census Bureau. Image Source: Center for Security Policy.

While Executive Order 13920 has yet to be reinstated by the current Trump administration, it has been making major policy shifts away from incentivizing wind and solar generation for the bulk power system. Even so, little historical evidence exists that either FERC or NERC will aggressively address the security issues associated with these systems, despite recent warnings about “kill switches” found hidden in Chinese-manufactured solar equipment. To be fair, the scope of the problem is so large — and so many states have provided financial incentives for grid-scale wind and solar systems — that this threat will need to be addressed at the state and local level as well.

The States Must Act

Given the reliability and security risks, states should rapidly reevaluate their policies and the “green energy” mandates that demand and incentivize grid-scale wind and solar systems. Similarly, since electrons don’t care about state boundaries, they must evaluate how they are connected to other states with such mandates. Electrons also don’t care about political parties — and so the effort to enhance the reliability and security of the grid must be a bipartisan effort.

So far, some states have already begun the process of prioritizing reliability and security through various types of legislation. Some, such as Virginia, Indiana, and Louisiana, have expanded the definition of “clean energy” to go beyond just wind and solar systems to consider other generation sources such as nuclear power, which can be defined as “renewable” if we harness the energy of slightly used nuclear fuel. Other states, such as Kentucky, Missouri, and Utah, have taken legislative steps to increase electric reliability by more strongly regulating the retirement of dispatchable electric generation facilities (such as nuclear, coal, and natural gas) in an effort to keep these systems going.

On the security front, Texas took a major step in 2021 with the passage of the Lone Star Infrastructure Protection Act, which seeks to address concerns associated with adversarial nations being able to access critical systems through the supply chain. The bill’s sponsor, Senator Tan Parker, also authored legislation launching a state-level Cyber Command to bolster cyber defenses.

Still, concerns among Texan citizens and lawmakers about the risks associated with BESSs — ranging from fire safety and environmental protection to cybersecurity and landowner rights — led to nineteen separate bills being filed on these matters in 2025. The most comprehensive grid security legislation in Texas filed so far has been championed for more than ten years by Senator Bob Hall — and it may soon become law, giving the state its own independent “Grid Security Commission” to address “all hazards” to the Texas grid. Other states would be wise to follow Texas’ lead, though it will be a more complicated process since no other state possesses its own independent electrical grid.

Our People Must Prepare

No matter how fast the federal and state governments try to move to address the reliability and the security risks associated with America’s ambitious adoption of Chinese-made wind and solar components, it may not be fast enough. Citizens will likely become more and more accustomed to receiving requests from their utilities to decrease power usage and to receiving “load shedding” alerts alongside local power outages. “Load shedding” is the term utilities use when they intentionally black out certain portions of the grid to maintain power for others, ensuring overall grid stability and causing what are known as “rolling blackouts.”

Worse yet, the Chinese Communist Party may decide one day in the future that it’s time to exploit the many supply chain and cyber vulnerabilities that they baked into the equipment they sold us. If this happens, the blackouts won’t be “rolling” but rather major and persistent. This is where domestically sourced, small-scale wind and solar power generators would be a helpful asset, alongside other forms of local energy, enabling the operator to function independently of the bulk power grid. Prudent state- and county-level emergency managers can play a major role in public education and promote enhanced personal, family, and community preparedness, following the example of Waldo County, Maine.

Ultimately, it’ll be up to the American people writ large to recognize that our aggressive push to adopt grid-scale wind and solar energy has placed us in a precarious position from which we must course correct. The more people are willing to speak the truth about the associated reliability, supply chain, and security concerns, the faster that’ll happen.

What’s less certain is whether government efforts to reduce its size will falter as the Trump administration scales back agencies involved in the process.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicts the dead zone will be around 5,500 square miles this summer. Some estimates suggest it will be a little smaller, including those from LSU research scientists Nancy Rabalais and R. Eugene Turner. Their study predicts the hypoxic zone to be around 4,800 square miles, taking into account how warmer water temperatures have altered the Gulf’s complex food web, helping reduce the dead zone.

The different models share one key element: their predicted size is about three times bigger than experts would like to see it.

A basin-wide problem

When nitrogen and phosphorus from farming fertilizers upriver washes down to the Gulf, the excess nutrients can cause algae to bloom near the surface of the water. When the algae dies and decomposes, it sinks into the water and depletes the oxygen fish and other aquatic life need to survive.

The hypoxic conditions affect commercial and recreational fishing as well as cause ecological harm.

Efforts to reduce nutrient runoff into the Gulf are largely outlined in the Environmental Protection Agency’s Hypoxia Task Force Action Plan. Long-term, its goal is to reduce the dead zone to about 1,900 square miles by 2035. Its short-term objective is to drop the amount nitrogen and phosphorus emptying into the Gulf by 20%.

Data from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), an integral agency in predicting the annual size of the dead zone, found the river’s phosphorus load was up 31% but its nitrate levels were about 24% below average in May.

That’s just a snapshot from a single month, said Doug Daigle, an LSU coastal research scientist and coordinator for the Louisiana Hypoxia Working Group, a state-based organization working to address the Gulf’s dead zone. He emphasized that multi-year data will give the most accurate picture into whether the U.S. is on target to meet its goals.

“Obviously, you don’t like it to be bigger in the years when it’s bigger, but then we also need to keep it in perspective in years when it’s smaller. It’s the trend over time that we’re looking at,” he said. “And we’re not at square one.”

Uncertainty ahead

Whether key federal agencies such as the USGS and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) will have sufficient funding and manpower to gauge if reduction goals are even being met is uncertain, Daigle said.

“There’s a lot of question marks about what’s happening to the federal agencies and their capacity … between the mass firings and all the other things that are happening,” he said.

Large sections of NOAA staff have been reduced, and USGS research and data collection funding faces millions of dollars in cutbacks.

Daigle added there’s supposed to be a meeting of the EPA’s Hypoxia Task Force later this year, but with all of the federal changes, its members might not have the bandwidth to assess whether reduction goals are being met.

“That’s all tentative at this point,” he said.

An EPA spokesperson said in an email that the agency “takes this initiative very seriously” and will continue its progress. They did not respond to specific questions over staffing capacity and funding resources.

NOAA’s communications staff declined to comment on staffing capacity, saying it “remains dedicated to providing timely information, research and resources.”

Several federal task force positions remain vacant as of June 12, with only “TBD” listed on the EPA’s website for spots reserved for its own representatives, the Geological Survey, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and other federal agencies.

NOAA predicts the size of the dead zone at the beginning of the summer using an aggregate of models from various partner universities, including LSU and the University of Michigan. The agency will monitor and survey the dead zone throughout the summer and review its estimates against the size of the actual dead zone in August.

“It’s about human behavior. There’s both a watershed issue and a global climate change issue here,” Turner said.

Turner and Rabalais agreed the problem isn’t with the EPA’s plan but a need for greater efforts to reduce nitrogen runoff upstream. Solutions such as cover crops and crop rotation strategies help farmers keep fertilizer in their soil for better plant growth and reduce hypoxia-causing runoff.

“Every place is going to be a little different, but there are ways to reduce this,” Turner said.

Whether funding will continue to support these programs is unknown. Aside from some Inflation Reduction Act money and funds from previous federal farm bills, financial support for nutrient reduction has been “modest,” Daigle said.

“There’s a lot of questions about what’s going to happen,” he added.

This upstream uncertainty affects industries that depend on the Gulf, such as commercial seafood harvesting, according to Daigle.

“They’re under a lot of stress” from hurricanes and the influx of cheap, foreign shrimp saturating the market, he said. Reducing the hypoxic zone before it becomes the final nail in the coffin for shrimping in the Gulf is part of the Task Force’s plan, and now is the time to drive home these reduction strategies, Daigle said

“The idea was that you wouldn’t wait for that to happen. You start reducing the loading, you reverse the trend,” he said.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Copy-of-plaquemines-flyover-2048x1365.jpg,N,,2025-06-12 23:57:46.487810

TRUMP: And we've ended the green new scam.

SPRUNT: The House passed a bill that would accomplish much of President Trump's agenda, like extending the 2017 tax cuts. To help pay for that, it takes an axe to clean energy credits. The bill would roll back incentives for wind, solar and hydrogen power, phase out consumer tax credits for new electric vehicles and terminate some credits for projects that begin construction more than 60 days after the bill's enactment. But it would also impact a lot of business happening in primarily red states.

BOB KEEFE: If you look at the total investments by business, 80% of them have gone into Republican congressional districts. So this isn't happening in California or New York. These aren't, you know, tree huggers or environmentalists getting hurt. It's workers in red states.

SPRUNT: That's Bob Keefe, Executive Director of E2, a nonpartisan pro-environment business group that's been tracking clean energy projects for over two years.

KEEFE: We've seen $14 billion worth of new factories and other projects - you know, clean energy, electric vehicle-related plants, solar projects, wind projects, battery projects - canceled in America because of the uncertainty over this bill.

SPRUNT: In April, four Republican senators sent a letter to Senate leadership saying a significant repeal of credits in place from the IRA could jeopardize job creation in the energy sector. Utah's John Curtis was one of them.

JOHN CURTIS: I think it's really important that Senate Republicans - and, I wish, House Republicans - look at this not from the standpoint of it's in the IRA, therefore it's bad, but rather, what is in the country's best interest and what is the best tax policy?

SPRUNT: He said credits should be analyzed individually to evaluate merit and that if credits are eliminated, how they go is important, both for consumers and for businesses.

CURTIS: If we're closing these down, let's just do it in a way that takes into account those employees at those businesses, the banks that loaned on those projects and make sure we have business certainty.

SPRUNT: He says his phone has been ringing off the hook with people concerned about the Senate's next steps.

CURTIS: I would say more than we can meet with.

SPRUNT: Senators aren't only hearing from lobbyists and industry leaders. They're also getting entreated by their Republican counterparts in the House.

ROB BRESNAHAN: We had some good conversations with a handful of senators.

SPRUNT: That's Congressman Rob Bresnahan of Pennsylvania, one of 13 House Republicans who are urging the Senate to substantially change the energy provisions that they voted for.

BRESNAHAN: You know, I'm OK with the phase-out but giving enough runway for projects that have already been committed and pledged to be completed before having the rug ripped out from, essentially, underneath them.

SPRUNT: Senate Finance Committee ranking member Ron Wyden, a Democrat, said he's optimistic that progress is being made among his GOP colleagues.

RON WYDEN: What I'm doing is going literally senator by senator of those who support innovation or, you know, understand that clean energy helps to create more competition and choice, which is also a kind of Republican idea.

SPRUNT: But in Congress, you make one group happy, and it crosses another group's red line. Once the Senate passes the bill, it then goes back to the House, and some members there have already said if the Senate waters down those clean energy rollbacks, they'll vote no.

As part of our ongoing series of articles regarding nuclear energy developments, the following provides a brief overview of the TVA application and recent federal and state law surrounding nuclear energy.

Executive Orders: The second Trump Administration has continued to emphasize nuclear generation through ongoing executive orders.
State Developments At the state level, lawmakers are using a variety of approaches to allow for and incentivize nuclear generation.","On May 20, 2025, the Tennessee Valley Authority (“TVA”) announced that it is the first American utility to submit a small modular reactor (“SMR”) construction permit application (“CPA”) to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (“NRC”). This announcement comes as a concrete response to the increased focus on adding new nuclear generation to U.S. energy resources.

As part of our ongoing series of articles regarding nuclear energy developments, the following provides a brief overview of the TVA application and recent federal and state law surrounding nuclear energy.

1. TVA Application

The TVA views its application as having broader implications beyond receipt of this individual permit. According to Don Moul, TVA President and CEO, “[t]his is a significant milestone for TVA, our region and our nation because we are accelerating the development of new nuclear technology, its supply chain and delivery model to unleash American energy…creating a path for other utilities who choose to build the same technology.”

The NRC previously approved an early site permit for the construction of SMRs at the Clinch River site in 2019, which included a certification that the site was usable for the construction of a nuclear plant from a safety, environmental and emergency planning perspective, but without identifying a specific technology. With this CPA, the TVA seeks specific approval for the construction of a GE Vernova Hitachi Nuclear Energy BWRX-300 reactor at the Clinch River site. The TVA has a targeted goal of generating nuclear energy by the 2030s. While this is the first application for approval of the BWRX-300 reactor in the U.S., GE Vernova recently announced that the BWRX-300 reactor has been approved for construction in Ontario.

Although it would not be generating energy for public consumption, chemical firm Dow, in partnership with engineering firm X-Energy, has also announced submission of a CPA to the NRC in Spring 2025, which has been accepted for review. According to the Office of Nuclear Energy’s announcement of the acceptance, the SMR would be used to power the Dow manufacturing facility in Seadrift, Texas as part of a demonstration project supported by the U.S. Department of Energy (“DOE”).

The TVA is similarly seeking strong financial support for its projects through the DOE’s Generation III+ Small Modular Reactor Program with a coalition of over a dozen other energy industry partners. This coalition is applying for the $800 million grant available through the DOE program.

2. Federal Developments

At the federal level, support for and removal of barriers to new nuclear generation has been a focal point of recent legislation and executive orders. The below provides a brief overview of key developments, which will be evaluated on an ongoing basis, including assessments of industry implications.

Nuclear Energy Innovation and Modernization Act (“NEIMA”): Signed by President Trump in 2019, the NEIMA was intended to promote advances in nuclear power plant designs, signaling an early focus on nuclear generation. The NEIMA required the NRC to establish a staged licensing process for advanced nuclear reactors and to create a technology-inclusive regulatory framework for licensing of commercial advanced reactors. The NRC was also given two years to develop and implement strategies within the existing regulatory framework for licensing research and test reactors. In connection with each of the above, the NRC was further required to provide intermittent progress reports.

Advance Act: Signed by President Biden in 2024, the Advance Act focuses on incentivizing competition through DOE-awarded prizes (including the grant under the Generation III+ Small Modular Reactor Program that the TVA coalition is applying for) and reducing licensing application fees, promoting microreactors through new NRC guidance and reducing cost for pre-application activities, encouraging placement of nuclear plants at retired coal plant sites, and focusing on U.S. production of high-assay low-enriched uranium.

Executive Orders: The second Trump Administration has continued to emphasize nuclear generation through ongoing executive orders. On May 23, 2025, the Trump Administration issued four executive orders, targeting different elements of the U.S. energy sector. Our recent article discusses the implications of these executive orders.

3. State Developments

At the state level, lawmakers are using a variety of approaches to allow for and incentivize nuclear generation.

Indiana’s Senate Enrolled Act No. 424 establishes a cost recover and filing structure for SMRs. Through Colorado’s HB25-1040, nuclear power is added to the State’s definition of “clean energy resources”, which would allow nuclear projects to contribute to the State’s clean energy goals and receive local funding. This spring, the governor of Massachusetts recently announced the Energy Affordability, Independence and Innovation Act, which, among other actions, would repeal the State’s requirement for new nuclear facilities to be approved by a ballot initiative. The Wisconsin State Senate recently passed SB 125 (currently sitting with the Assembly), which would require the establishment of a nuclear sting study to identify opportunities and sites for nuclear development.

Certain states like Minnesota have outright moratoriums on the construction of new nuclear plants but their lawmakers have begun reassessing those limitations. While they did not pass, two bills were proposed this spring that would either entirely remove Minnesota’s moratorium or specifically authorize the construction of SMRs.

4. More to Come

The TVA’s application signals renewed industry interest in nuclear energy generation, and combined with legislative and executive pressures, we anticipate many more developments in this area.

North Carolina is among the states that have benefited most from climate tech and clean energy-related investments since the passage of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), according to business and advocacy group E2.","“From first in flight to now the future of flight, North Carolina and our skilled workforce is soaring.,” North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein said in a statement.

JetZero anticipates the facility will create more than 14,500 jobs and offer competitive salaries. The Journal reported the plant will create both direct manufacturing and engineering jobs and indirect jobs with suppliers. Construction is slated to begin in the first half of 2026, putting JetZero on track for its goal to offer its aircraft for commercial use by 2032, the Journal reported.

JetZero is working on a next-generation aircraft with a sleek new design that essentially blends the body and wing of the aircraft together (hence the term blended wing body), as opposed to the popular tube and wing configuration in use today. JetZero’s Z4 aircraft is expected to contain as many as 250 seats, but be about one third the weight of aircraft with similar capacity.

The lighter weight and more aerodynamic design are expected to allow the aircraft to fly higher, meaning less atmospheric drag. JetZero anticipates these efficiencies will improve fuel burn and cut emissions by up to 50 percent.

The company has major backing or buy-in from numerous airlines, including 14 that have been advising it through JetZero’s Airline Working Group. Alaska Airlines and United have invested in JetZero, with United conditionally agreeing in April to purchase up to 200 aircraft. Delta in March announced a partnership with JetZero in which it will lend its operational expertise to develop a full-scale demonstrator aircraft for the U.S. Air Force, targeted for testing in 2027.

JetZero also joined Delta’s Sustainable Skies Lab innovation accelerator, which will offer the startup resources and expertise to commercialize its aircraft—Delta even agreed to design the aircraft’s interior.

North Carolina is among the states that have benefited most from climate tech and clean energy-related investments since the passage of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), according to business and advocacy group E2. Although IRA incentives mostly intersect with the aerospace sector by way of sustainable aviation fuel, JetZero was among the companies to win a Fueling Aviation’s Sustainable Transition (FAST) grant through the IRA.

Even so, JetZero’s investment in the Greensboro area comes as many companies are cancelling or delaying previously announced climate tech projects and related jobs in the U.S. amid the uncertainties introduced by President Donald Trump’s tariffs and policies.","https://img-cdn.inc.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit/vip/2025/06/jetzero-north-carolina-inc.jpg",N,,2025-06-12 23:45:48.485719

The decision, announced Wednesday by Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, threw a lifeline to the proposed Twin Metals Minnesota mine near Ely.
Democratic administrations have tried to kill the project because of what they called the threat of acid mine drainage into Boundary Waters, the country’s most-visited federally designated wilderness area.
“The announcement by Secretaries Burgum and Rollins is shocking,” Ingrid Lyons, executive director of Save the Boundary Waters, said in a statement.
The Boundary Waters are too precious,” Smith said.","MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — President Donald Trump’s administration is moving to lift restrictions on copper-nickel mining that the Biden administration imposed near the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness in northeastern Minnesota.

The decision, announced Wednesday by Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, threw a lifeline to the proposed Twin Metals Minnesota mine near Ely.

Democratic administrations have tried to kill the project because of what they called the threat of acid mine drainage into Boundary Waters, the country’s most-visited federally designated wilderness area.

Twin Metals is owned by Chilean mining giant Antofagasta. President Barack Obama’s administration declined to renew the company’s mineral rights leases in the area in 2016. The first Trump administration reinstated those leases in 2019.

President Joe Biden’s administration canceled the leases again in 2022 and imposed a 20-year moratorium on mining known as a “mineral withdrawal” in a 350-square-mile (900-square-kilometer) area of the Superior National Forest upstream from the wilderness that includes the proposed underground mine site.

Trump has singled out copper as a focus of his domestic minerals policy and promised during a campaign stop in St. Cloud, Minnesota, last year that he would quickly reverse the moratorium.

The Boundary Waters is managed by the U.S. Forest Service, which is part of the Agriculture Department, putting it under Rollins’ purview, and the leases are controlled by Burgum’s Interior Department.

“After careful review, including extensive public input, the US Forest Service has enough information to know the withdrawal was never needed,” Rollins posted on X. “We look forward to working with Sec. Burgum to pursue American Energy Dominance and reverse the costly and disastrous policies of the Biden Administration.”

Twin Metals spokesperson Kathy Graul praised the Trump administration for beginning the process of reversing the Biden administration’s decision, which she said was “based on a deeply flawed assessment” that failed to consider environmental safeguards the company built into its project design.

The company argues that its mine design will prevent acid discharges, and that the best way to determine whether it’s safe is by allowing it to undergo a formal environmental review process, which the state canceled in 2022.

“Overturning the mineral withdrawal will allow Minnesota the opportunity to become a global leader in the much-needed domestic production of minerals under some of the most rigorous environment and labor standards in the world,” Graul said in a statement.

But critics disputed her claim about public input, pointing out that the Trump administration has not conducted a formal public comment process on the policy reversal.

“The announcement by Secretaries Burgum and Rollins is shocking,” Ingrid Lyons, executive director of Save the Boundary Waters, said in a statement. “They claim to have consulted with the people of Minnesota about the Boundary Waters when they clearly have not.”

Democratic U.S. Sen. Tina Smith of Minnesota scoffed at the secretary’s claim about a “careful review,” saying on X that the administration is “using pseudoscience to justify bad actions” and predicting that the decision will be challenged in court.

“Not this mine. Not this place. The Boundary Waters are too precious,” Smith said.

Republican U.S. Rep. Pete Stauber, who represents northeastern Minnesota and has championed the region’s iron and copper-nickel mining industries, said the Biden-era decision was a “massive wrong” that only “further cemented our reliance on Communist China” for critical minerals.

“As the demand for critical minerals continues to skyrocket, I look forward to seeing Minnesota’s skilled miners safely deliver our vast mineral wealth to the nation using the best labor and environmental standards in the world,” Stauber said in a statement.

Twin Metals is separate from two other proposed copper-nickel mines in Minnesota, the NewRange project formerly known as PolyMet, near Hoyt Lakes, which remains stalled by regulatory and court setbacks, and Talon Metals, near McGregor, which the Biden administration supported.",https://www.greenfieldreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/preview-1032.jpg,N,,2025-06-12 23:49:48.383123

Many of these communities are rural and secluded, a contrast to the region’s population center of Asheville, where I live. Although beautiful and unique, the geography of the region made it especially difficult to coordinate a regional response after the devastation wrought by Hurricane Helene on September 27, 2024.

Helene brought unprecedented rainfall and strong winds to the area. Water settled in the many low-points, causing creeks and rivers to rise quickly. The resulting flood devasted Asheville and neighboring communities — many homes and businesses were under water and over 396,000 people in the state, mostly those in the Western region, lost power. Thousands were still without power over two weeks after the storm.

When Hurricane Helene moved inland, the town of Hot Springs, like the rest of the region, lost power. However, unlike Asheville, Hot Springs is equipped with a microgrid. On the Monday after the storm, the Dept. of Transportation allowed Duke Energy to cross the French Broad River bridge to get into Hot Springs, and Duke worked to address some minor microgrid issues including depleted batteries. While the microgrid was able to support load on Tuesday, October 1, damage assessments were still being performed in the town, and the microgrid returned power to the town’s critical facilities on October 2 after flood areas were deemed safe to re-energize.

This effort took just a few days — a rapid turnaround in comparison to many communities in the Carolinas and Georgia that faced weeks-long outages. The microgrid continued to power Hot Springs for nearly a week before a mobile substation — a portable, self-contained electrical distribution system — was brought in to reconnect the town to the larger utility grid.

Other relief efforts were cropping up across Western North Carolina. In the immediate aftermath of the storm, after clearing a path through downed trees out of his East Asheville home, Jamie Trowbridge scrawled a handwritten note on the door of Sundance Power Systems, a solar installation company in Weaverville, relaying the need for backup power to help residents gathering at the Barnardsville fire station and community center. Barnardsville, a rural community located 20 miles north of Asheville, was isolated, leaving many residents unable to access critical services.

Trowbridge worked to gather supplies stored in local garages and basements of his solar industry friends, and he started spreading the word about the need for donated batteries and solar gear. Coordinating this effort was challenging due to the lack of cell service across the region. Trowbridge had to drive to the top of a large hill in West Asheville just to get reception. I did the same in the aftermath of Helene, biking to higher elevation so I could call family and let them know I was safe.

Word of Trowbridge’s efforts soon spread to Footprint Project, a nonprofit organization that provides emergency support through resilient power technologies to communities in the wake of natural disasters. Footprint arrived in Barnardsville with two mobile solar and battery storage trailers, which powered essential community facilities and provided a Starlink internet connection.

Once grid power was restored to Barnardsville, Footprint Project staff began identifying other communities in need of support. They established their base of operations and accumulated a large supply of solar and battery storage equipment. These donations became the foundation of Asheville-based Free Store, which provides long-term, no-cost rentals of solar and storage equipment to businesses, organizations and individuals who are still in need of reliable power even many months after the storm. Firestorm Books, a West Asheville bookstore that became an impromptu neighborhood relief hub in the days after the storm, was powered through Free Store equipment. My friends and I met there daily to attend community meetings and share food, resources and plans.

Disaster relief efforts are still ongoing in Western North Carolina and there is still significant need for equipment as well as for future resilience planning. Matt Abele, executive director of the North Carolina Sustainable Energy Association (NCSEA), emphasized that in the immediate aftermath of a disaster there is often an outpouring of support, but in the months that follow, impacted areas often see a significant slow-down in this support.

“There is a real opportunity in this moment to ensure we are elevating the value that this equipment has already brought to the region, and how it can help the region better prepare for future storms,” Abele said.

Local organizations are working to maintain this momentum while also still recovering from the disaster. Electrify Asheville-Buncombe is advocating for solar and battery storage to power wells for drinking water in rural areas. NCSEA, Greentech Renewables and Land of Sky Regional Council are engaged in an ongoing fundraising campaign to support fully mobile equipment (with a particular emphasis on serving vulnerable populations, such as those with electricity-dependent medical needs), semi-permanent installations and permanent community resilience hub infrastructure located in population-dense areas where people can aggregate after disasters.

NCSEA also advocates for more state grant funding for microgrids serving critical facilities such as telecommunications and water infrastructure. Fundraising efforts benefitting more mobile solar + storage equipment, facilitated through Footprint Project, also continue in the region. Using the Hot Springs microgrid as a case study, Duke Energy is planning to expand microgrid deployment in the region, specifically aimed at bolstering electricity resilience in rural areas with a history of prolonged outages.

The organizations, communities and utilities operating in Western North Carolina continue to work tirelessly to repair the damage and rebuild what was lost. This is evidenced by the slow cleanup progress I see every time I drive along the French Broad River or hear news of roads and bridges being re-opened. These ongoing efforts go beyond simple restoration; they represent a critical opportunity to reimagine and reinforce the region’s infrastructure, economy and support systems. By integrating more sustainable practices, enhancing emergency preparedness and fostering stronger community networks, these initiatives not only address the immediate aftermath but also are laying the groundwork for a more resilient and adaptive region that is better equipped to withstand future challenges. Solar and battery storage needs to be a critical piece of that plan.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. President Donald Trump and executives from the tech and energy sectors will appear at an artificial intelligence and energy summit in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on July 15, the office of the state's U.S. Senator Dave McCormick said on Thursday.

McCormick's inaugural Pennsylvania Energy and Innovation Summit will be held at Carnegie Mellon University, his office said in a statement.

Axios reported that tech executives like OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai were on the summit's guest list. Exxon Mobil CEO Darren Woods, Shell CEO Wael Sawan and Chevron CEO Mike Wirth were also on that list, according to Axios.

White House AI czar David Sacks, who is also expected to attend the summit, expressed concern earlier this week that regulating U.S. AI too tightly could stifle growth and cede the critical market to China.

The comments indicated the Republican president's approach to AI could be centered on expanding markets abroad for U.S. AI chips and models. Democratic former President Joe Biden had emphasized policies that countered risks the chips could be diverted to China and used to bolster Beijing's military.

A group of 40 state attorneys general, including Republicans from Ohio, Tennessee, Arkansas, Utah and Virginia and other states, have pushed back against Republican attempts to block states from regulating AI, saying states should develop and enforce common-sense regulation to protect consumers.

The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management it has reopened consideration of the national Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) oil and gas leasing program for offshore oil and gas drilling, including restricted areas, such as the Atlantic OCS.

“Launching the process to develop the 11th National Outer Continental Shelf Program marks a decisive step toward securing American Energy Dominance,” said Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum.

But it’s garnering mixed reviews in the Palmetto State.

Belvin Olasov, who was born and raised on the Isle of Palms, is no stranger to the South Carolina coast.

I grew up going to the beach often,” he said. “I think it's one of the most sacred things we have in the Lowcountry.”

A reconsideration of offshore drilling along the southern Atlantic Coast would reverse a .

BACKGROUND |

Kenzie Poole, a staff attorney with the South Carolina Environmental Law Project, called it a “huge change in any status quo.”

Poole said the shift would bring oil drilling to an area that hasn’t seen it since 1983. Her group also claims it’s illegal and violates 2021 case law.

“Once a president permanently withdraws ocean areas from oil and gas leasing, those protections cannot simply be reversed by the wave of a pen,” Poole said. “That is what is still in place when it comes to the moratorium and case law on the permanent ban.”

On top of the legality, Poole said the impacts of offshore drilling would be felt closer to home than the name suggests.

“There would be a huge presence of infrastructure that would be coming in to support any kind of offshore drilling. So, it wouldn't be just offshore, it would also be on land,” she explained.

In the past, drilling and seismic testing threatens South Carolina’s nearly $24 billion tourism industry.

Many argue it also puts marine life at risk.

I know people here care about seafood, care about the fisheries, that's another big part of Charleston life,” Olasov said, “and those webs of life can really be disrupted.”

While this is just a first step from the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management to receive information, Olasov, founder of the Charleston Climate Coalition, feels South Carolinians’ voices are being ignored.

“I think that's not right. I think that the people of South Carolina have spoken really clearly that they don't want offshore drilling, and so imposing it on us feels really unfair,” he said.

Anyone can to the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management for or against offshore drilling.

Health risks of PFAS exposure PFAS are toxic at extremely low levels.","WASHINGTON – New data(link is external) released by the Environmental Protection Agency shows an additional 6.5 million Americans have drinking water contaminated by the toxic “forever chemicals” known as PFAS. It brings the total number of people at risk of drinking this contaminated tap water to about 165 million across the U.S.

That’s a 4% increase in the number of Americans with verified PFAS-polluted water in just the last few months. Exposure to PFAS is linked to cancer, reproductive harm, immune system damage and other serious health problems,(link is external) even at low levels.

“It is impossible to ignore the growing public health crisis of PFAS exposure. It’s detectable in nearly everyone and it's found nearly everywhere, including the drinking water for a huge segment of the population,” said David Andrews, Ph.D., acting chief science officer at the Environmental Working Group.

“The documented extent of PFAS contamination of the country’s water supply highlights the enormous scale of contamination,” he added.

The EPA’s new findings come from tests of the nation’s drinking water supply conducted as part of the Fifth Unregulated Contaminant Monitoring Rule(link is external), or UCMR 5, which requires U.S. water utilities to test drinking water for 29 individual PFAS compounds.

Protections under threat

In 2024, the EPA finalized first-time limits on six PFAS in drinking water, which help tackle forever chemicals contamination – but these standards are now at risk.

The EPA has said it will roll back limits on four PFAS in drinking water, leaving those chemicals unregulated. It plans to only retain standards for the two most notorious chemicals, PFOA and PFOS. These maximum contaminant levels(link is external) or MCLs, set enforceable standards for the amount of contaminants allowed in drinking water.

Even with keeping the PFOA and PFOS MCLs in place, rolling back the four other limits will make it harder to hold polluters responsible and ensure clean drinking water.

In addition, the EPA’s plan to reverse the four science-based MCLs likely contradicts an anti-backsliding provision in the Safe Drinking Water Act. That law requires(link is external) any revision to a federal drinking water standard “maintain, or provide for greater, protection of the health of persons.”

“It’s worrying to see the EPA renege on its commitments to making America cleaner and safer, especially as it ignores its own guidelines to do so,” said Melanie Benesh, EWG’s vice president for government affairs.

Widespread PFAS pollution

The Trump administration’s PFAS standards rollback could grant polluters unchecked freedom to release toxic forever chemicals into U.S. waterways, endangering millions of Americans.

EWG estimates nearly 30,000 industrial polluters could be discharging PFAS into the environment, including into sources of drinking water. Restrictions on industrial discharges would lower the amount of PFAS ending up in drinking water sources.

“Addressing the problem means going to the source. For PFAS, that’s industrial sites, chemical plants and the unnecessary use of these chemicals in consumer products,” said Andrews.

Health risks of PFAS exposure

PFAS are toxic at extremely low levels. They are known as forever chemicals because once released into the environment, they do not break down and can build up in the body. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has detected PFAS in the blood(link is external) of 99 percent of Americans, including newborn babies.

Very low doses of PFAS have been linked to suppression of the immune system(link is external). Studies show exposure to PFAS can also increase the risk of cancer, harm fetal development and reduce vaccine effectiveness.

For over 30 years, EWG has been dedicated to safeguarding families from harmful environmental exposures, holding polluters accountable and advocating for clean, safe water.

“Clean water should be the baseline,” Andrews said, “The burden shouldn’t fall on consumers to make their water PFAS-free. While there are water filters that can help, making water safer begins with ending the unnecessary use of PFAS and holding polluters accountable for cleanup.”

For people who know of or suspect the presence of PFAS in their tap water, a home filtration system is the most efficient way to reduce exposure. Reverse osmosis and activated carbon water filters can be extremely effective at removing PFAS.

EWG researchers tested the performance of 10 popular water filters to evaluate how well each reduced PFAS levels detected in home tap water.

New deduction for business-development company investors: The bill allows investors in business-development companies to take advantage of a unique 23% tax deduction.
What the Reconciliation Bill Means for Investors If passed, this bill will affect investors in a variety of ways.
Where Does the Reconciliation Bill Go From Here?","As Congress moves forward with a new budget reconciliation package, known colloquially as the “Big Beautiful Bill,” corporations across the country are bracing for a wave of regulatory and tax policy changes that could significantly reshape their operations and profitability.

Reconciliation is a legislative process that allows certain budget-related bills to bypass the Senate filibuster and pass with a simple majority. Since this makes congressional approval more attainable, this process has emerged as a powerful tool for advancing fiscal policy priorities.

Historically, the reconciliation process has been used to advance sweeping tax and spending policy priorities. This bill is no exception as it includes several provisions that will likely have profound implications for banks, investment firms, insurance companies, and other financial services providers.

The bill passed the House on May 22, 2025, and is now being considered by the Senate. Here’s what investors should know about what’s in it and its potential impact on their portfolios.

What’s in the Reconciliation Bill?

The most closely watched elements of the House-passed version of the legislation cover:

Deregulation: The bill includes several measures that would loosen regulatory oversight over corporations across a variety of industries. For example, this proposal includes reforms that would accelerate and expand permitting for fossil fuel projects, pipelines, and mining operations. It also includes reduced capital and liquidity requirements for banks, and would roll back investor protections by weakening the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s enforcement authority over digital finance products.

Corporate tax rate: The House-passed version of the reconciliation bill includes an increased tax deduction for qualified business income under Section 199A. Specifically, the deduction is increased to 23% from 20%, ultimately lowering the effective tax rate on qualified business income to 28.49% from 29.6%.

Elimination of clean energy credits: The bill calls for an accelerated phaseout of clean energy tax incentives established under the Inflation Reduction Act. It would end tax credits for wind, solar, and battery storage projects by 2028 and mandate that eligible projects commence construction within 60 days of the bill’s enactment.

New deduction for business-development company investors: The bill allows investors in business-development companies to take advantage of a unique 23% tax deduction. Under this provision, investors in qualified business-development companies now receive a 23% tax deduction on certain dividend payments.

Research and development incentives: The bill reinstates immediate expensing for research and development costs, reversing changes made in previous tax legislation. This provision is expected to significantly benefit technology companies, pharmaceutical firms, and other innovation-driven sectors by improving their cash flow and encouraging continued investment in R&D activities.

What the Reconciliation Bill Means for Investors

If passed, this bill will affect investors in a variety of ways.

On the positive side, the corporate tax cuts will increase aftertax profits for many companies, which will likely boost stock valuations in capital-intensive and domestic sectors (for example, industrials, manufacturing, and energy). The bill also proposes wholesale changes to the environmental permitting process that will make permit acquisition easier for critical energy and mineral projects, ultimately providing a boost to these sectors.

Moreover, loosening liquidity requirements on banks will create more capital flexibility that could drive increased merger and acquisition activity, boosting valuations in the financials sector. The capital gains indexation could also spark increased trading activity as investors feel more comfortable realizing gains, potentially boosting market liquidity and transaction volumes.

Additionally, the new 23% deduction on business-development company dividends will boost aftertax returns for existing investors while making these income-generating funds more attractive to new capital.

That said, several notable provisions present significant risks for investors.

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is a key source of data and analysis of the consumer markets, and the proposed cuts to the CFPB would considerably reduce the quantity and quality of financial information that investors can access.

The elimination of clean energy credits will also significantly impact businesses relying on these credits. In turn, this change will affect investors, particularly those with portfolios focused on climate, sustainable infrastructure, and energy transition.

Moreover, institutional investors will likely reallocate away from environmental, social, and governance strategies as they become even more politically vulnerable, which will have a cascading effect for investors involved in ESG funds.

Where Does the Reconciliation Bill Go From Here?

With slim margins in the Senate and competing priorities within the Democratic caucus, the reconciliation bill’s final contours remain uncertain. However, investors and the financial-services industry writ large are preparing for a range of scenarios, from modest tax adjustments to sweeping regulatory mandates.

Legislative experts suggest that the bill’s timeline could extend into late summer, with potential amendments and modifications expected as it moves through the Senate. Key swing votes in both chambers will likely demand additional provisions or modifications, potentially altering the bill’s final impact on various sectors and investment strategies.

In the near term, there’s likely not much policymakers can do about electricity prices, and therefore utility bills going up.","A proposed rule published in the Federal Register on Wednesday argues that U.S. fossil fuel-fired power plants make up “a small and decreasing part of global emissions” and therefore are not significant, and do not require regulation under the law. The rule would repeal all greenhouse gas emission standards for new and existing power plants — both the standards the Biden administration finalized last year, which have been tied up in court, as well as the standards that preceded them, which were enacted by Obama in 2015.

In a separate proposal, the EPA also took steps to repeal limits on mercury and hazardous air pollutants from coal plants that were enacted last year, reverting the standard back to one set in 2012.

The argument that U.S. power plants make up a small sliver of global emissions and thus aren’t worth addressing is like having “a five-alarm fire that could be put out if you send out all the trucks, and you don’t send any of the trucks because no one truck could put the fire out by itself,” David Doniger, a senior attorney and strategist at the Natural Resources Defense Council, told me. “We just think that is a wacky reversal and a wacky interpretation of the Clean Air Act.”

When you add up every plug, power button, and light switch across the country, electricity usage produces 25% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions each year. Over the past 30 years, American power plants have contributed about 5% of the total climate pollution spewed into the atmosphere worldwide.

In the global context, that may sound small. But in a recent report titled “The Scale of Significance,"" New York University’s Institute for Policy Integrity estimated that if U.S. power plants were a country, it would be the sixth biggest emitter in the world, behind China, the European Union, India, Russia, and the remainder of U.S. emissions. The report also notes that U.S. actions on emissions make other countries more likely to follow, due to technological spillovers that reduce the cost of decarbonization globally.

The Technical Argument

In addition to the significance finding, the EPA gave two other reasons for repealing the power plant rules. It argued that “cost-effective control measures are not reasonably available,” meaning there’s no economic way to reduce emissions at the source. It also said the new administration’s priority “is to promote the public health or welfare through energy dominance and independence secured by using fossil fuels to generate power.”

The first argument is an attempt to say that Biden’s standards flouted the law. In 2022, the Supreme Court ruled that the EPA could not simply tell states to reduce emissions from the power sector, which is what the Obama administration had initially tried to do. Instead, the agency would have to develop standards that could be applied on a plant-by-plant basis — so long as those rules were “cost-reasonable” and “adequately demonstrated.”

To comply with that ruling, Biden’s EPA based its standards on the potential to install carbon capture technology that can reduce flue gas emissions by 90%. The regulations would have required existing coal plants to install carbon capture by 2039, or else shut down. (To the chagrin of many energy system observers, the administration chose not to apply limits to existing gas-fired power plants.) But while fossil fuel companies and utilities had, in the past, asserted that carbon capture was viable, they deemed the standards impossible to meet.

Trump’s EPA is now agreeing. “In 2024,” Zeldin said on Wednesday, “rules were enacted seeking to suffocate our economy in order to protect the environment, to make all sorts of industries including coal and more disappear, regulate them out of existence.”

The Long Game

When Trump moved to overturn Obama’s power plant regulations during his first term, his EPA did not contest the significance of the sector’s emissions, and simply enacted a weaker standard. A week before he left office, the agency also finalized a rule that set the threshold for “significance” at 3% of U.S. emissions — which exempted major polluters like refineries, but still applied to power plants.

This time, Trump has a new apparent game plan: Strip the Clean Air Act of its jurisdiction over greenhouse gases altogether. Today’s action was the first step; EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin has said the agency will similarly “reconsider” emissions rules for cars and oil and gas drilling. But the cornerstone of the plan is to reverse what’s known as the “endangerment finding” — the 2009 conclusion that greenhouse gases present a threat to public health and welfare, and therefore are one of the pollutants EPA must address under the Clean Air Act.

“The Trump administration is trying to say, don’t worry about the Clean Air Act. It will never apply, so you can go back to your old ways,” said Doniger. But if the argument that power plant emissions are insignificant is a stretch, appraising greenhouse gas emissions as benign is inconceivable, he said. “The endangerment finding was based, in 2009, on a Denali-sized mountain of evidence. Since then, it’s grown to Everest-size, so there’s no way that they would be able to put together a rational record saying the science is wrong.”

The Chevron Trap

These highly technical questions of whether emissions are “significant” or whether carbon capture is “adequately demonstrated” could soon be determined by a group of people who lack both the expertise to answer them and the inclination to wade through thousands of pages of atmospheric science and chemical engineering documents: judges.

Last year, the Supreme Court overturned a long-held precedent known as Chevron deference. That ruling means that the courts are no longer required to defer to an agency’s interpretation of statute — judges must make their own determinations of whether agencies are following the intent of the law.

When environmental groups begin challenging the EPA’s repeals in court, judges are “going to be bombarded with the need to make these highly technical, nuanced decisions,” Michael Wara, a lawyer and scholar focused on climate and energy policy at Stanford University, told me. He said the reason Chevron deference was established in the first place is that judges didn’t want to be making engineering decisions about power plants. “They felt extremely uncomfortable having to make these calls.”

The conservative Supreme Court overturned the precedent because of a sense that political decisions were being dressed up in scientific reasoning. But Wara doesn’t think the courts are going to like being put back into the role of weighing technical minutia and making engineering decisions.

“It’s a past that the courts didn’t like and they tried to engineer a way out of via the Chevron doctrine,” he said. “I would expect that we’re going to see a drift back toward a doctrine that looks a little bit more Chevron-like, maybe less deference to agencies. But it’s hard to predict in the current environment what’s going to happen.”

This has led to scrambling by state governments, with New Jersey announcing hundreds of millions of dollars of relief to alleviate rate increases as high as 20%. Maryland convinced one utility to spread out the increase over a few months.

While the dysfunctions of PJM are distinct and well known — new capacity additions have not matched fossil fuel retirements, leading to skyrocketing payments for those generators that can promise to be on in time of need — the overall supply and demand dynamics of the electricity industry could lead to a broader price squeeze.

“Trump and JD Vance can get off tweets about how there’s no inflation, but I don’t think they’ll feel that way in a week or two,” Skanda Amarnath, executive director of Employ America, told me.

And while the consumer price index is made up of, well, almost everything people buy, electricity price increases can have a broad effect on prices in general. “Everyone relies on energy,” Amarnath said. “Businesses that have higher costs can’t just eat it.” That means higher electricity prices may be translated into higher costs throughout the economy, a phenomenon known as “cost-push inflation.”

Aside from the particular dynamics of any one electricity market, there’s likely to be pressure on electricity prices across the country from the increased demand for energy from computing and factories. “There’s a big supply adjustment that’s going to have to happen, the data center demand dynamic is coming to roost,” Amarnath said.

Jefferies Chief U.S. Economist Thomas Simons said as much in a note to clients Wednesday. “Increased stress on the electrical grid from AI data centers, electric vehicle charging, and obligations to fund infrastructure and greenification projects have forced utilities to increase prices,” he wrote.

Of course, there’s also great uncertainty about the future path of electricity policy — namely, what happens to the Inflation Reduction Act — and what that means for prices.

The research group Energy Innovation has modeled the House reconciliation bill’s impact on the economy and the energy industry. The report finds that the bill “would dramatically slow deployment of new electricity generating capacity at a time of rapidly growing electricity demand.” That would result in higher electricity and energy prices across the board, with increases in household energy spending of around $150 per year in 2030, and more than $260 per year in 2035, due in part to a 6% increase in electricity prices by 2035.

In the near term, there’s likely not much policymakers can do about electricity prices, and therefore utility bills going up. Renewables are almost certainly the fastest way to get new electrons on the grid, but the completion of even existing projects could be thrown into doubt by the House bill’s strict “foreign entity of concern” rules, which try to extricate the renewables industry from its relationship with China.

“We’re running into a set of cost-push dynamics. It’s a hairy problem that no one is really wrapping their heads around,” Amarnath said. “It’s not really mainstream yet. It’s going to be.”

In some relief to American consumers, if not the planet, while it may be more expensive for them to cool their homes, it will be less expensive to get out of them: Gasoline prices fell 2.5% in May, according to the BLS, and are down 12% on the year.

However, I have learned that the wind industry’s worst fears are indeed coming to pass. The Fish and Wildlife Service, which is responsible for approving any activity impacting endangered birds, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, tasked with greenlighting construction in federal wetlands, have simply stopped processing wind project permit applications after Trump’s orders – and the freeze appears immovable, unless something changes.

According to filings submitted to federal court Monday under penalty of perjury by Alliance for Clean Energy New York, at least three wind projects in the Empire State – Terra-Gen’s Prattsburgh Wind, Invenergy’s Canisteo Wind, and Apex’s Heritage Wind – have been unable to get the Army Corps or Fish and Wildlife Service to continue processing their permitting applications. In the filings, ACE NY states that land-based wind projects “cannot simply be put on a shelf for a few years until such time as the federal government may choose to resume permit review and issuance,” because “land leases expire, local permits and agreements expire, and as a result, the project must be terminated.”

While ACE NY’s filings discuss only these projects in New York, they describe the impacts as indicative of the national industry’s experience, and ACE NY’s executive director Marguerite Wells told me it is her understanding “that this is happening nationwide.”

“I can confirm that developers have conveyed to me that [the] Army Corps has stopped processing their applications specifically citing the wind ban,” Wells wrote in an email. “As I have understood it, the initial freeze covered both wind and solar projects, but the freeze was lifted for solar projects and not for wind projects.”

Lots of attention has been paid to Trump’s attacks on offshore wind, because those projects are sited entirely in federal waters. But while wind projects sited on private lands can hypothetically escape a federal review and keep sailing on through to operation, wind turbines are just so large in size that it’s hard to imagine that bird protection laws can’t apply to most of them. And that doesn’t account for wetlands, which seem to be now bedeviling multiple wind developers.

This means there’s an enormous economic risk in a six-month permitting pause, beyond impacts to future energy generation. The ACE NY filings state the impacts to New York alone represent more than $2 billion in capital investments, just in the land-based wind project pipeline, and there’s significant reason to believe other states are also experiencing similar risks. In a legal filing submitted by Democratic states challenging the executive order targeting wind, attorneys general listed at least three wind projects in Arizona – RWE’s Forged Ethic, AES’s West Camp, and Repsol’s Lava Run – as examples that may require approval from the federal government under the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act. As I’ve previously written, this is the same law that bird conservation advocates in Wyoming want Trump to use to reject wind proposals in their state, too.

The Fish and Wildlife Service and Army Corps of Engineers declined to comment after this story’s publication due to litigation on the matter. I also reached out to the developers involved in these projects to inquire about their commitments to these projects in light of the permitting pause. We’ll let you know if we hear back from them.",https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81OTg2MTI1NC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc2MDA5NDI5MH0.QKEQVpFhKz3ec12g71fN7OW88qvSnENz63BUPb0H_II/image.jpg?width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C100%2C0%2C100,N,,2025-06-12 23:57:49.825611

Coal-fired power plants would be forced to capture smokestack emissions or shut down under a strict EPA rule issued last year.
Then-EPA head Michael Regan said the power plant rules would reduce pollution and improve public health while supporting a reliable, long-term supply of electricity.
The power sector is the nation’s second-largest contributor to climate change, after transportation.
“The world is round, the sun rises in the east, coal-and gas-fired power plants contribute significantly to climate change, and climate change increases the risk of heat waves, catastrophic storms and many other health threats,” Frumkin said.","WASHINGTON (AP) — The Environmental Protection Agency on Wednesday proposed repealing rules that limit planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions from power plants fueled by coal and natural gas, an action that Administrator Lee Zeldin said would remove billions of dollars in costs for industry and help “unleash” American energy.

The EPA also proposed weakening a regulation that requires power plants to reduce emissions of mercury and other toxic pollutants that can harm brain development of young children and contribute to heart attacks and other health problems in adults.

The rollbacks are meant to fulfill Republican President Donald Trump’s repeated pledge to “unleash American energy” and make it more affordable for Americans to power their homes and operate businesses.

If approved and made final, the plans would reverse efforts by Democratic President Joe Biden’s administration to address climate change and improve conditions in areas heavily burdened by industrial pollution, mostly in low-income and majority Black or Hispanic communities.

The power plant rules are among about 30 environmental regulations that Zeldin targeted in March when he announced what he called the “most consequential day of deregulation in American history.”

Zeldin said Wednesday the new rules would help end what he called the Biden and Obama administration’s “war on so much of our U.S. domestic energy supply.”

“The American public spoke loudly and clearly last November,” he added in a speech at EPA headquarters. “They wanted to make sure that … no matter what agency anybody might be confirmed to lead, we are finding opportunities to pursue common-sense, pragmatic solutions that will help reduce the cost of living … create jobs and usher in a golden era of American prosperity.”

Environmental and public health groups called the rollbacks dangerous and vowed to challenge the rules in court.

Dr. Lisa Patel, a pediatrician and executive director of the Medical Society Consortium on Climate & Health, called the proposals “yet another in a series of attacks” by the Trump administration on the nation’s “health, our children, our climate and the basic idea of clean air and water.”

She called it “unconscionable to think that our country would move backwards on something as common sense as protecting children from mercury and our planet from worsening hurricanes, wildfires, floods and poor air quality driven by climate change.”

“Ignoring the immense harm to public health from power plant pollution is a clear violation of the law,” added Manish Bapna, president and CEO of the Natural Resources Defense Council. “If EPA finalizes a slapdash effort to repeal those rules, we’ll see them in court.”

The EPA-targeted rules could prevent an estimated 30,000 deaths and save $275 billion each year they are in effect, according to an Associated Press examination that included the agency’s own prior assessments and a wide range of other research.

It’s by no means guaranteed that the rules will be entirely eliminated — they can’t be changed without going through a federal rulemaking process that can take years and requires public comment and scientific justification.

Even a partial dismantling of the rules would mean more pollutants such as smog, mercury and lead — and especially more tiny airborne particles that can lodge in lungs and cause health problems, the AP analysis found. It would also mean higher emissions of the greenhouse gases driving Earth’s warming to deadlier levels.

Biden, a Democrat, had made fighting climate change a hallmark of his presidency. Coal-fired power plants would be forced to capture smokestack emissions or shut down under a strict EPA rule issued last year. Then-EPA head Michael Regan said the power plant rules would reduce pollution and improve public health while supporting a reliable, long-term supply of electricity.

The power sector is the nation’s second-largest contributor to climate change, after transportation.

In its proposed regulation, the Trump EPA argues that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases from fossil fuel-fired power plants “do not contribute significantly to dangerous pollution” or climate change and therefore do not meet a threshold under the Clean Air Act for regulatory action. Greenhouse gas emissions from coal and gas-fired plants “are a small and decreasing part of global emissions,” the EPA said, adding: “this Administration’s priority is to promote the public health or welfare through energy dominance and independence secured by using fossil fuels to generate power.”

The Clean Air Act allows the EPA to limit emissions from power plants and other industrial sources if those emissions significantly contribute to air pollution that endangers public health.

If fossil fuel plants no longer meet the EPA’s threshold, the Trump administration may later argue that other pollutants from other industrial sectors don’t either and therefore shouldn’t be regulated, said Meghan Greenfield, a former EPA and Justice Department lawyer now in private practice.

The EPA proposal “has the potential to have much, much broader implications,” she said.

Zeldin, a former New York congressman, said the Biden-era rules were designed to “suffocate our economy in order to protect the environment,” with the intent to regulate the coal industry “out of existence” and make it “disappear.”

National Mining Association president and CEO Rich Nolan applauded the new rules, saying they remove “deliberately unattainable standards” for clean air while “leveling the playing field for reliable power sources, instead of stacking the deck against them.”

But Dr. Howard Frumkin, a former director of the National Center for Environmental Health and professor emeritus at the University of Washington School of Public Health, said Zeldin and Trump were trying to deny reality.

“The world is round, the sun rises in the east, coal-and gas-fired power plants contribute significantly to climate change, and climate change increases the risk of heat waves, catastrophic storms and many other health threats,” Frumkin said. “These are indisputable facts. If you torpedo regulations on power plant greenhouse gas emissions, you torpedo the health and well-being of the American public and contribute to leaving a world of risk and suffering to our children and grandchildren.”

A paper published earlier this year in the journal Science found the Biden-era rules could reduce U.S. power sector carbon emissions by 73% to 86% below 2005 levels by 2040, compared with a reduction of 60% to 83% without the rules.

“Carbon emissions in the power sector drop at a faster rate with the (Biden-era) rules in place than without them,” said Aaron Bergman, a fellow at Resources for the Future, a nonprofit research institution and a co-author of the Science paper. The Biden rule also would result in “significant reductions in sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides, pollutants that harm human health,” he said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/dims.apnews-1-1.webp,N,,2025-06-12 23:32:49.941006

Tariffs and potential repeals of federal funding are creating roadblocks to the further buildout of energy projects.

Wind, solar, and other renewable energy projects have helped revitalize rural communities by creating jobs, generating new tax revenues, and providing lease payments to landowners.

However, energy projects rely on globally sourced components due to the U.S. supply chain’s inability to meet rising demand. To avoid tariffs, solar developers are stockpiling panels, but the impact is only delayed. Battery storage is critical for grid reliability and faces tariffs of up to 65%.

The rising costs are forcing companies to delay or cancel plans.

For example, the Plum Creek Wind Project in Minnesota was cleared for construction this fall, but the project developer, National Grid Renewables, has pressed pause due to escalating costs tied to tariffs.

The slowdown threatens rural economies by halting the local jobs and long-term positions in operations and maintenance that new construction brings. Tax revenues from energy projects fund vital infrastructure and critical public services like schools, emergency services, and roads. In Iowa’s Howard County, 147 wind turbines account for 14.5% of the county’s total annual tax revenue.

According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, about 85% of U.S. farm households earned the majority of their income from off-farm sources. Hosting wind turbines or solar panels offers a stable source of income through lease payments, but the additional income is at risk if renewable energy development declines.

Rural economies have grown thanks to renewable energy development, but without continued investment, many communities will not be able to unlock those economic benefits.

Contact your congressional representatives. Tell them to support federal funding for renewable energy development and oppose tariffs that will affect future development in rural communities.

A draft White House budget leaked in April suggested the Trump administration would end federal funding for the partnerships.
The plan calls for downsizing NOAA’s research division, which oversees the federal research laboratories headquartered in Boulder.","Since 1967, the National Center for Atmospheric Research’s Mesa Laboratory has stood on a hilltop above Boulder, offering an iconic reminder of the scientific quest to better understand Earth’s climate and weather systems.

The federally funded lab has built supercomputers and developed radar tools to help improve weather predictions. It’s also a leading example of a Colorado-based institution swept up in the Trump administration's efforts to shrink federal funding for climate science and related fields.

After initial fights over grant freezes and job cuts, the White House has released funding plans for the next fiscal year beginning in October. NCAR is sponsored by the National Science Foundation, which published its latest budget proposal on May 30. The plan calls for a 40 percent funding cut for the center that employs hundreds of researchers in Boulder.

“A funding reduction of 40 percent would likely mean far-reaching cuts to our programs and labs,” said David Hosansky, an NCAR spokesperson. “It's too soon to say which specific research programs and positions would be affected if Congress were to approve such a budget reduction.”

Other Colorado climate research hubs could face significant cuts under a detailed White House budget request released in early May. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration—the federal agency in charge of weather, climate and ocean predictions—operates four scientific labs at the David Skaggs Research Center in Boulder. Their work includes monitoring global greenhouse gas concentrations, operating flights to track ground-level ozone pollution, a state-of-the-art model to predict wildfire smoke and a project to study the climate impact of melting permafrost.

The Trump administration’s latest detailed budget proposal eliminates $608 million in funding for NOAA’s Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research, which oversees the Boulder labs. That aligns with a budget request leaked in April showing the White House hopes to shutter the division and shift some pieces to other parts of the organization.

Congress must consider and approve a final federal budget. If it greenlights the president's plan, John Tayer, the executive director of the Boulder Chamber, said the cuts would devastate critical research and a local economy built around federal labs.

“ It would be a terrible mistake for our country to backtrack on its investments in innovation and research,” Tayer said. “ We will be actively engaged in all of our lobbying efforts to make sure that the activities in Boulder, specifically, and across the country, are supported.”

Federal labs driving the local economy

The federal government never had an overarching plan to concentrate research facilities in Colorado.

Starting in the 1950s, different agencies and academic panels independently decided to build laboratories in the state, said Dan Powers, the executive director of CO-LABS, a nonprofit group advocating for federal research in Colorado.

Today, Powers said the state now boasts the country’s second-highest concentration of federally funded research entities. While that’s a boon to the local economy, it also means Colorado is vulnerable if Congress proceeds with President Trump’s proposed budget.

“You’re not only possibly losing the employees and the revenue that they might spend on restaurants, clothing or car repairs,” Powers said. “You’re also losing their impact on the communities in the ways they volunteer their expertise and participate in other types of civic projects.”

Federal funding supports more than 2,000 jobs related to earth science research in northern Colorado. An NCAR spokesperson confirmed the center employs more than 1,300 people in Boulder and Broomfield.

In addition, Colorado is the only state with two NOAA cooperative institutes—academic and non-profit partnerships built to support the agency’s research efforts. The Cooperative Institute for Research in the Atmosphere (CIRA) works through Colorado State University, and the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences (CIRES) operates at the University of Colorado Boulder.

Steven Miller, the director of CIRA in Fort Collins, said the institute employs roughly 130 people in Boulder and Fort Collins. Waleed Abdalati, the current executive director of CIRES and the former NASA chief scientist, said the institute employs more than 700 people in Boulder. Many work alongside an additional 350 direct federal employees at NOAA’s Colorado labs.

It’s unclear if the White House plans to ax NOAA’s cooperative institutes. A draft White House budget leaked in April suggested the Trump administration would end federal funding for the partnerships. Abdalati, however, said the more recent budget documents don't explicitly address the issue, and he’s hopeful Congress will intervene to save the research alliances.

Meanwhile, some former federal employees are still reeling from earlier cuts enacted through the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE.

In February, the Trump administration terminated more than 800 NOAA employees as part of a larger attempt to trim wasteful spending, focusing on newer “probationary” workers with a lower level of job protection. Hundreds of demonstrators gathered outside the agency’s David Skaggs Research Center to protest the layoffs in the weeks afterward.

The federal government briefly reinstated the employees after a federal court blocked the job cuts, then re-fired them when a higher court lifted the decision in April.

Susan Cobb, a NOAA communications specialist who lost her position, said the legal wrangling has left her and other impacted workers in a kind of employment purgatory. She hasn’t received an official termination letter and doesn’t know if the government plans to pay her unused vacation.

“We have no power, we have no documentation, we have no rights. We’re kind of just fighting the system,” Cobb said.

A battle outlined in Project 2025

If the White House enacts its proposed budget, the cuts to federal climate research would carry out a vision laid out in Project 2025, the conservative 900-page policy outline written by the Heritage Foundation, a D.C.-based think tank.

The plan calls for downsizing NOAA’s research division, which oversees the federal research laboratories headquartered in Boulder. The policy document says the office is the source of “climate alarmism” and the majority of its climate-change research should be “disbanded.”

Abdalati rejected any suggestions that climate scientists want to alarm the public. He said their mission remains focused on informing policymakers and helping the public plan for an increasingly volatile climate.

“It's very hard to believe that, in an environment that is changing, we wouldn't wanna do our best to understand those changes,” Abdalati said. “That's directly what is being targeted in some of these budgetary numbers.”

The U.S. The House and Senate are now working on their own proposed budgets for the fiscal year. After the release of the president’s proposal, Congressman Joe Neguse, a Democrat representing Boulder, called the federal laboratories the “crown jewels” of the country’s climate research system.

“Gutting NOAA and its research would be gravely irresponsible and would put our communities at great risk,” Neguse said in a written statement. “Make no mistake, we’re going to continue to push back against the Trump Administration’s disastrous proposals to strip this agency of its funding.”",https://www.cpr.org/icons/favicon-32x32.png,N,,2025-06-12 23:34:07.529554

But the Clean Air Act also allows California to adopt more stringent emission requirements than EPA, because California was the only state that had its own vehicle emissions standards before the passage of the Federal Clean Air Act.
Once EPA grants California a waiver, Massachusetts may adopt California’s standards and does not need a waiver of its own.
As Congress intended, those waivers have allowed California, and the states that adopted California’s standards, to improve on their vehicle emissions programs.
The complaint asks the court to declare the CRA resolutions to be unlawful and to require the Administration to implement the Clean Air Act consistent with the granted waivers.","BOSTON — Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Joy Campbell today joined a coalition of 10 attorneys general in filing a lawsuit against the Trump Administration, including the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), challenging the illegal and unprecedented use of the Congressional Review Act (CRA) to disapprove California’s waivers for its Advanced Clean Cars II (ACCII), Omnibus, and Advanced Clean Trucks (ACT) standards, which Massachusetts subsequently adopted. The Administration’s actions deny the filing states the right to enforce vehicle emissions standards needed to achieve each state’s goals and protect their residents from harmful pollution.

“The Congressional Review Act was not designed to undermine a state’s right to set and enforce its own public health standards simply because the President opposes them,” said AG Campbell. “I will continue to fight against illegal policies that harm our residents and thwart our climate goals.”

The Clean Air Act requires EPA to set federal emission standards for air pollutants from new motor vehicles or new motor vehicle engines that cause or contribute to air pollution that endangers public health or welfare. But the Clean Air Act also allows California to adopt more stringent emission requirements than EPA, because California was the only state that had its own vehicle emissions standards before the passage of the Federal Clean Air Act. California can enforce its standards if EPA grants California a preemption waiver. The Act requires EPA to approve waivers for California’s rules absent certain, limited circumstances not present here. Once EPA grants California a waiver, Massachusetts may adopt California’s standards and does not need a waiver of its own. Since 2023, EPA has granted California three waivers, allowing it to enforce the ACCII, Omnibus, and ACT programs, and Massachusetts has adopted each of those programs as its own. Historically, EPA, under both Democratic and Republican administrations, has granted California more than 75 preemption waivers for updates to its new motor vehicle emissions control program. As Congress intended, those waivers have allowed California, and the states that adopted California’s standards, to improve on their vehicle emissions programs.

Motor vehicle emissions contribute to the formation of smog, as well as fine particle pollution and toxic air pollution, all of which are linked to premature death, respiratory illness, cardiovascular problems, and cancer, among other serious health impacts. Transportation is also the leading source of greenhouse gas emissions in the country, and cars and trucks account for 80% of those transportation emissions.

Massachusetts has a strong interest in curbing greenhouse gas emissions to mitigate the worst impacts of climate change, which are being felt in every corner of the Commonwealth, especially in already overburdened communities. Electric vehicles result in approximately 79% less carbon dioxide emissions statewide than their gasoline powered counterparts. Those programs are a critical component of the Commonwealth’s efforts to protect its residents and meet its statutorily mandated greenhouse gas emission-reduction goals.

Under ACCII, which Massachusetts adopted in 2022, and enforcement discretion issued by the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection (MassDEP), automakers must continue to sell an increasing number of zero-emission vehicles in Model Year 2028 and beyond. By model year 2035, manufactures must be able to show that 100% of the passenger vehicles sold in Massachusetts are zero-emission. They may meet this requirement in a variety of ways, including selling up to 20% plug-in hybrids and accruing credits through several options detailed in the regulations.

The Advanced Clean Trucks regulations, which Massachusetts adopted in 2021, aim to accelerate the widespread adoption of zero emission vehicles in the medium and heavy-duty truck sector, are similarly critical for Massachusetts’ efforts to meet air quality standards and protect public health. And the Omnibus regulation, which Massachusetts also adopted in 2021 and which becomes effective for Model Year 2026, requires internal combustion heavy-duty trucks sold in Massachusetts to meet strict standards for oxides of nitrogen (NOx) emissions, which are major contributors to smog formation.

Under the direction of President Trump, EPA transmitted the three California waivers to Congress as “rules” subject to CRA procedures, even though the three waivers state EPA’s consistent and longstanding position under both Republican and Democratic administrations that waiver decisions are not “rules.” The Republican-controlled U.S. House of Representatives and the Senate illegally used the CRA to target California’s Clean Air Act waivers even though the CRA does not apply to such waiver decisions.

According to the attorneys general, waivers have never been subject to the CRA nor have any other agency orders for permission, such as oil and gas leases or mining permits. The Administration’s actions undermine states’ authority to set specific standards and limitations on decarbonization through motor vehicle emissions to protect the health and safety of their residents.

The complaint filed today alleges that the attempt to invalidate California’s waivers violated constitutional principles of federalism, the Take Care Clause, and multiple federal statutes including the Congressional Review Act and the Administrative Procedure Act. The complaint asks the court to declare the CRA resolutions to be unlawful and to require the Administration to implement the Clean Air Act consistent with the granted waivers.

Joining AG Campbell in filing the lawsuit are the attorneys general of California, Colorado, Delaware, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington.

Electric vehicle sales in China surpassed over one million units in a single month for the first time this year, driven by strong domestic demand and targeted export efforts from Chinese manufacturers, notably BYD, tapping into emerging markets.

BYD’s exports to Mexico and South-east Asia, along with Uzbekistan, have significantly boosted sales in these regions, Rho Motion data manager Charles Lester said.

Fleet incentives in Germany and robust growth in Southern Europe helped lift the European market, while the expiry of Canadian subsidies dragged on North American demand, he added.

US tariff

Global automakers face a 25 per cent import tariff in the United States, the world’s second-largest car market, causing many of them to withdraw their outlooks for 2025.

In Europe, new incentives for fleet buyers in Germany are expected to support electric car sales through the second half of the year.

Tesla’s Model Y production in Berlin shields it from tariffs, yet it faces market share pressures as production ramps up globally amidst shifting trade tensions.

President Donald Trump’s stance towards emissions standards and uncertainties around tariffs has also hampered EV growth in North America.

In the US, tax credits for EVs are still available but will begin phasing out from 2026, contributing to hesitation among buyers.

Clean energy tax credits approved under the Biden administration are under debate in the Senate. House Republicans voted to gut these programs, but not all of their fellow Republicans in the Senate are on board. NPR's Barbara Sprunt has more.

BARBARA SPRUNT, BYLINE: President Trump has long talked about his frustrations with clean energy provisions signed into law by President Biden in the Inflation Reduction Act. Here he is at an April rally in Michigan.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: You know what I don't give approval to? Those stupid windmills that go round and round and round.

(BOOING)

TRUMP: And we've ended the green new scam.

SPRUNT: The House passed a bill that would accomplish much of President Trump's agenda, like extending the 2017 tax cuts. To help pay for that, it takes an axe to clean energy credits. The bill would roll back incentives for wind, solar and hydrogen power, phase out consumer tax credits for new electric vehicles and terminate some credits for projects that begin construction more than 60 days after the bill's enactment. But it would also impact a lot of business happening in primarily red states.

BOB KEEFE: If you look at the total investments by business, 80% of them have gone into Republican congressional districts. So this isn't happening in California or New York. These aren't, you know, tree huggers or environmentalists getting hurt. It's workers in red states.

SPRUNT: That's Bob Keefe, Executive Director of E2, a nonpartisan pro-environment business group that's been tracking clean energy projects for over two years.

KEEFE: We've seen $14 billion worth of new factories and other projects - you know, clean energy, electric vehicle-related plants, solar projects, wind projects, battery projects - canceled in America because of the uncertainty over this bill.

SPRUNT: In April, four Republican senators sent a letter to Senate leadership saying a significant repeal of credits in place from the IRA could jeopardize job creation in the energy sector. Utah's John Curtis was one of them.

JOHN CURTIS: I think it's really important that Senate Republicans - and, I wish, House Republicans - look at this not from the standpoint of it's in the IRA, therefore it's bad, but rather, what is in the country's best interest and what is the best tax policy?

SPRUNT: He said credits should be analyzed individually to evaluate merit and that if credits are eliminated, how they go is important, both for consumers and for businesses.

CURTIS: If we're closing these down, let's just do it in a way that takes into account those employees at those businesses, the banks that loaned on those projects and make sure we have business certainty.

SPRUNT: He says his phone has been ringing off the hook with people concerned about the Senate's next steps.

CURTIS: I would say more than we can meet with.

SPRUNT: Senators aren't only hearing from lobbyists and industry leaders. They're also getting entreated by their Republican counterparts in the House.

ROB BRESNAHAN: We had some good conversations with a handful of senators.

SPRUNT: That's Congressman Rob Bresnahan of Pennsylvania, one of 13 House Republicans who are urging the Senate to substantially change the energy provisions that they voted for.

BRESNAHAN: You know, I'm OK with the phase-out but giving enough runway for projects that have already been committed and pledged to be completed before having the rug ripped out from, essentially, underneath them.

SPRUNT: Senate Finance Committee ranking member Ron Wyden, a Democrat, said he's optimistic that progress is being made among his GOP colleagues.

RON WYDEN: What I'm doing is going literally senator by senator of those who support innovation or, you know, understand that clean energy helps to create more competition and choice, which is also a kind of Republican idea.

SPRUNT: But in Congress, you make one group happy, and it crosses another group's red line. Once the Senate passes the bill, it then goes back to the House, and some members there have already said if the Senate waters down those clean energy rollbacks, they'll vote no.

The 11-state coalition filed the case against the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in the federal district court covering northern California. The legal action comes the same day President Trump signed multiple resolutions seeking to end federal waivers allowing California to set its own vehicle emissions standards.

“Today, we’re saving California, and we’re saving our entire country from a disaster. Your cars are going to be thousands of dollars less,"" President Trump said at a White House signing ceremony.

In a press release, Colorado Attorney General Phil Wiser called the move a “breathtaking” attack on clean air, adding that the litigation is necessary to save the state’s plans to improve air quality, cut ozone pollution and give carbuyers more choices.

In the last few years, Colorado and California have emerged as the nation’s leading electric vehicle markets, with plug-in vehicles accounting for roughly a quarter of new vehicle sales. Tax credits and rebate programs helped drive the trend, but the state’s looming sales mandates pushed carmakers to develop more attractive models, said Travis Madsen, the transportation program director for the Southwest Energy Efficiency Project, a Boulder-based environmental advocacy group.

“I think it worked. One of the reasons there’s so many EVs available is Colorado and the other clean car states pushing manufacturers to make the cars Coloradans want,” Madsen said.

Federal law has historically permitted the state to adopt stricter rules due to its severe air pollution challenges. Other states can in turn decide whether to adopt those standards.

California has exercised its power to require a rapid shift to electric vehicles. Under rules approved in 2022, 35 percent of 2026 car models sold within the state cannot release emissions. The regulation then bans all sales of gas- and diesel-powered cars by 2035. A separate rule requires manufacturers to sell a rising percentage of zero-emissions trucks starting next year.

Colorado adopted its own version of both clean vehicle rules in 2023. While air quality officials opted against California’s requirement for a 100 percent EV market by 2035, the rules still require that 82 percent of all vehicles sold in the state are electric by 2032.

A similar clean truck sales mandate requires manufacturers to offer more zero-emissions trucks over the next few years. A separate rule cribbed from California requires gas- and diesel-powered truck engines to limit nitrogen oxide emissions, a key ingredient behind ground-level ozone pollution known to smother the Front Range every summer.

At issue is the legal mechanism behind the push to end the EV rules. The resolutions signed by Trump seek to revoke California’s waivers through the Congressional Review Act, a law allowing the U.S. House and Senate to overturn regulations issued by federal agencies.

In the past, however, the EPA has concluded the law doesn’t apply to California’s waivers since the special allowance counted as a “decision” rather than a “rule.” The Senate parliamentarian, a nonpartisan staffer who interprets Senate rules, agreed the law didn’t apply to the waivers.",https://www.cpr.org/icons/favicon-32x32.png,N,,2025-06-12 23:29:39.233538

My work isn’t just a job, it’s a great career. This industry pays well, jobs like mine can’t be offshored and many are in rural communities. It feels good to work on something my community needs: The projects I’ve worked on power hundreds of thousands of homes with clean, reliable electricity. But without continued support from Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) tax credits, many similar projects across Iowa could stall, leaving both workers and communities without the economic and environmental benefits they provide.

Even as Iowa workers, families and communities reap the benefits of clean energy, we've seen members of the U.S. House of Representatives just this month curtail these incredible opportunities by passing a federal budget bill severely weakening or cutting clean energy tax credits.

That's why I'm strongly urging Sens. Chuck Grassley and Joni Ernst to stand with workers in our industry and Iowan families across the state and ensure that these tax credits remain a powerful source of support for Iowa’s economy.

Grassley has the opportunity right now to secure his wind energy legacy. Ernst, who expressed her enthusiasm for wind energy when I met her on Capitol Hill in March, can also help ensure Iowa continues to reap the benefits of a reliable, affordable, and green source of energy.

Workers, families, and communities in Iowa want to see these strategic investments and policies continue so our jobs remain intact and we can build a future that's better for our economy, our people and our environment.

By strengthening, rather than weakening, the Inflation Reduction Act, Senators can ensure that the momentum of our wind energy industry persists and we can keep energy bills low and job creation high. With continued support, we can build a prosperous, resilient, and healthier future for all.

The company's Z4 planes are equipped with seating for 250 passengers, at up to 50% better fuel efficiency than today's commercial tube & wing jets. The company plans to have its first commercial airplanes delivered by the early 2030s.

""North Carolina offers the ideal combination of talent, infrastructure, and forward-thinking leadership to support our mission to reshape aviation,"" said Tom O'Leary, CEO and co-Founder of JetZero. ""This facility is a critical milestone in bringing our all-wing Z4 to market. I applaud the leadership of Governor Josh Stein and his team as well as the leadership of the North Carolina General Assembly, and whole host of local leaders and organizations for working with us to bring JetZero to North Carolina, the birthplace of aviation.""

North Carolina is uniquely positioned to support Jet Zero's growth, with a plentiful and skilled labor force of 5.5 million, and over 49,00 engineers. Additionally, the state is the nation's leading manufacturing workforce in the Southeast, and with more than 30,000 STEM degrees are awarded annually — the state provides a strong, sustainable talent pipeline for years to come.

Additionally, North Carolina provides an attractive business climate for companies like JetZero. Ranked a top 3 state for business for five consecutive years by CNBC, the state has the lowest corporate tax rate, and falling, at 2.25%, and a cost of living 5% below the national average. Well aligned with JetZero's commitment to sustainability, North Carolina also offers low cost of energy and has a bi-partisan approach to renewable energy leadership and sustainability.

""This announcement is a testament to North Carolina's growing reputation as a magnet for aerospace innovation and top-tier STEM talent,"" said Christopher Chung, CEO of the Economic Development Partnership of North Carolina. ""With our rapidly growing population and dynamic workforce, we're attracting industry leaders to create quality jobs that will strengthen our local economy and communities across the state.""

JetZero has secured investments and conditional purchase agreements from Alaska Airlines and United Airlines. Approximately 14 airlines have joined JetZero's Airline Working Group to provide input on their needs, including the requirement for the Z4 to readily fit into today's airport infrastructure.

Additionally, Jet Zero is partnering with Siemens and their Smart Infrastructure, Electrification, and Automation divisions, headquartered in North Carolina, to design the greenfield factory to leverage the latest digital and industrial AI tools to ensure the most efficient and cost-effective production and operating model. Siemens also supports JetZero's design/build/test model for the Demonstrator aircraft, a full-scale prototype slated for first flight in 2027. Siemens tools enable accelerated design, adaptable manufacturing, and digital test, shaving years of development time while upholding the highest quality and safety standards.

The facility will create thousands of direct advanced manufacturing and engineering jobs, and indirect and induced jobs via suppliers and services providers. Jobs offered at the facility will have average wages above $89,000 per year. Additionally, becoming the next aerospace hub in the U.S. will bring significant opportunities for North Carolina students from high school graduates to community colleges to the State's higher education system.

The company and the state will work closely together to create customized workforce development and training programs. The North Carolina Community College System, home to 58 community colleges, is on board to develop a customized training program estimated to value more than $22 million, which will help deliver the large-scale workforce the company is planning to hire.

""North Carolina's expansive community college network will serve as a critical workforce development engine for JetZero,"" said John Loyack, vice president of economic development for the North Carolina Community College System. ""We've already discussed the company's unique workforce needs and outlined a detailed customized training plan which will be developed through our NCEdge program. In a joint effort with Guilford Technical Community College and other colleges in the region, we're excited to move forward into implementing a customized program that will set Jet Zero up for workforce onboarding success here in North Carolina.""

Partnering with the North Carolina Department of Commerce and the Economic Development Partnership of North Carolina on this project were the North Carolina General Assembly, North Carolina Community College System, Guilford Tech Community College, Forsyth Tech Community College, University of North Carolina System, North Carolina A&T State University, North Carolina State University, University of North Carolina at Charlotte, North Carolina Department of Transportation, Golden LEAF Foundation, Duke Energy, Piedmont Natural Gas, Piedmont Triad Airport Authority, Piedmont Triad Partnership, GuilfordWorks, Guilford County Economic Development Alliance, Guilford County, Forsyth County, Greensboro Chamber of Commerce, High Point Economic Development Corporation, Greater Winston-Salem, Inc., City of Greensboro, City of High Point and the City of Winston-Salem. In addition, Senator Phil Berger (President Pro Tempore), Representative Destin Hall (Speaker of the House), and Representative Donny Lambeth (Senior Appropriations Chair) were instrumental in bringing this deal to fruition.

U.S. Oil Growth Has a One-Basin Problem Putin Extends Russian Oil Export Ban to Price Cap Countries Through 2025 Egypt Locks In Landmark LNG Import Deals With Aramco, Shell, and Trafigura","President Trump’s U.S. energy dominance agenda could be derailed by one provision in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the tax and spending bill championed by the President and currently under review by the U.S. Senate.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act contains Section 899, officially named ‘Enforcement of remedies against unfair foreign taxes.’

This section proposes to increase the tax rates on foreign companies operating in the United States from countries that have what the Bill describes as “unfair foreign taxes.”

It is widely believed that “unfair foreign taxes” relate to the EU and UK tax regimes, which the Trump Administration considers as discriminatory in taxing U.S. firms, especially America’s technology giants.

If the Big Beautiful Bill passes as-is, increased tax rates would hurt Europe-based energy companies with large operations in the United States. These include the UK’s Shell and BP, France’s TotalEnergies, and Spain’s Repsol, Reuters columnist Ron Bousso notes.

Higher taxes on major foreign oil and gas operators in the U.S. would reduce company profits and potentially undermine further investment by them in expanding U.S. oil and gas supply.

This is the opposite of President Trump’s ‘drill, baby, drill’ slogan from the campaign trail and the executive orders and legislation along the same lines passed in the first months in office of the new administration.

As a result of Section 899, Shell could lose up to $800 million of free cash flow per year from its Gulf of Mexico operations alone. The hit to BP could be as much as $300 million off its free cash flow a year, according to estimates by Reuters’ Bousso.

Section 899 of the Big Beautiful Bill would hurt overall investment in the U.S. from abroad and would cost America jobs, trade groups and fund managers warn.

The Investment Company Institute (ICI), representing fund managers in the U.S., said that Section 899 “is currently written in a manner that could limit foreign investment to the US—a key driver of growth in American capital markets that ultimately benefits American families saving for their futures.”

The Global Business Alliance, a trade group for international companies in the United States, warned that Section 899 could eliminate 700,000 U.S. jobs and reduce U.S. GDP by $100 billion annually, citing an independent third-party analysis by the EY Quantitative Economics and Statistics (QUEST) practice.

But what we do know is that Senate Republicans are looking to rewrite two of the hardest-fought provisions in the House’s bill.

Senate Finance Committee Chair Mike Crapo (R-Idaho) told GOP senators Wednesday that he plans to scale back the House’s SALT cap deal and rework repeals of clean energy tax credits from the Inflation Reduction Act.

The changes could put Speaker Mike Johnson in a perilous position in his quest to get the reconciliation bill done by July 4. Here’s why:

1) Two New York Republicans have said they won’t vote for a dollar less than the House’s $40,000 cap on deducting state-and-local taxes. There are a handful of other SALT Caucus Republicans who’ve warned the Senate against changes and view the negotiations as settled.

The SALT backers are expecting Johnson to sell the cap to the Senate and make sure it sticks. If it doesn’t, expect some furious blue-state lawmakers.

Aware of the potential pitfalls in changing SALT, Sen. Markwayne Mullin (R-Okla.) said he’s been talking with blue-state House Republicans about it “almost every day.” Mullin, who often acts as a liaison with the House, said it’s his “number one issue” right now.

2) Crapo told senators that Finance’s plan for IRA credits involves accelerating some repeals and allowing gentler phase-outs for others based on energy type. The IRA cuts could get close to the more than $500 billion that the House included, but may tally somewhat lower.

The House Freedom Caucus has been pressing senators to hold the line on the House version. The details of the Senate’s plan will matter a lot. Remember: House Republicans like Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas) want nothing short of gutting the IRA to its core.

Over a dozen House GOP moderates are tracking the IRA changes closely, too. The House had to walk a tightrope on the IRA cuts, and now the Senate is as well.

Senate strategy: Senate Majority Leader John Thune is trying to be cautious of the House’s needs, but he can only do so much.

The Senate’s vote-counting math is simply different than the House’s. GOP senators are totally dug-in against the House bill’s SALT cap. They see it as a small minority of lawmakers in one chamber forcing them to accept a policy they dislike — and that costs more than $350 billion compared to extending the current cap.

Thune is juggling different IRA demands, including at least four senators who want a less aggressive approach to repeals.

There’s also the money factor. The Senate Finance Committee is planning to make key business tax breaks for R&D spending, interest expenses and buying machinery and equipment permanent in their rewrite of the House-passed package. This is a top priority for many Finance Committee Republicans.

Permanence balloons the tax bill’s cost, so GOP senators have to find savings elsewhere, such as with SALT. Senate Republicans also want to dial back some of President Donald Trump’s tax priorities in order to reduce the overall cost.",https://punchbowl.news/wp-content/uploads/MikeCrapo_12012020-1-1.jpg,N,,2025-06-12 23:41:11.965065

At the same time, the top Senate Democrat is pulling out the stops to salvage what he can from the landmark climate law.

At a closed-door Senate meeting, Finance Chair Mike Crapo (R-Idaho) told senators he wanted to “extend the runway” for certain tax credits that House Republicans all but scrapped in their budget reconciliation package — though details were sparse.

Senators said Crapo talked about amending the language for when a project must “start construction” and preserving a provision that lets a project sponsor transfer tax credits to a third party.

The House-passed bill would also drastically phase out renewable incentives and enact strict new supply chain requirements that industry deemed unworkable.

Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.) said he thought Crapo was “very much” open to extending the lifespan of incentives for “certain types of energy and then other types of energy are going to expire quicker, … and he talked pretty specifically of nuclear of course, to which I said, ‘Amen and amen.’”

The Finance Committee is expected to release more details Monday night, Cramer added. He said Wednesday’s meeting “was just more conceptual.”

But others noted the ethos of the bill is not expected to change much.

“We’re trying to keep the intent of the House intact, for the most part,” said Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), a Finance member, though he’s been pushing for some specific changes to soften strict requirements.

Schumer a ‘perpetual motion machine’

As Republicans continue to inch forward on their megabill, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) has been working to sway them against wholesale repeals of the Inflation Reduction Act.

Indeed, after President Donald Trump and Republicans swept the elections last year, Schumer said he knew he had to gear up to protect the IRA.

He reached out to clean energy executives and environmental leaders months ago, he said, but no one was prepared for how aggressive the House legislation that passed just before Memorial Day would be.

“No one expected it to be as bad as it was,” he said. “At the last minute, overnight, they dramatically reduced or eliminated the clean energy provisions. Most of the Republican congressmen didn’t know of it, but I called up everyone that weekend, and I said, ‘DEFCON 1,'” referring to the highest alert level for nuclear war.

In recent weeks, he’s been enlisting finance people; clean energy advocates; tech executives; governors with major renewables investments; “friendly” Trump administration officials; Duke Energy and Southern Co. executives; and Sean McGarvey, president of North America’s Building Trade Union, to call their senators.

“Chuck is spending so much time and energy on this,” Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) said at a press conference on Capitol Hill on Wednesday. “He’s become like a perpetual motion machine.”

Specifically, Schumer and his allies are targeting 16 Senate Republicans who he thinks show “some discomfort” with undoing the IRA.

“I have a list of the one hundred biggest clean energy projects in America,” Schumer said. “Eighty percent are in red states, it turns out. One of the companies that runs those projects is saying, ‘People, call your senator,’ and say, ‘This will shut me down.’ And they are doing it.”

Energy price spike?

Beside trying to woo Republicans, Schumer and other Democrats have been saying the GOP megabill threatens to raise energy prices.

A new analysis from the Democratic-aligned Center for American Progress set to be released Thursday found that slashing the IRA could cut 13 gigawatts of clean power on the grid per year over the next decade. In 2024, the U.S. added 49 gigawatts of new capacity to the grid, with 95 percent from new solar, batteries, nuclear and wind power.

“As much as 72 percent of all clean energy capacity that would have been built over the next decade would disappear,” the report says.

Asked if he worried Democrats might be able to run on rising electricity costs in the midterm elections, Rep. Buddy Carter (R-Ga.), who’s running for Senate and has backed a Hyundai vehicle and battery plant in his district, shrugged off the question.

“That remains to be seen,” he said. “I’m not sure energy costs are going to go up. In fact, I would submit that as we concentrate more on available energy such as natural gas, it might go down. And that’s certainly something we’re trying to do.”

He added: “So I think that’s risky on their part — to say the least.”

Intense lobbying

Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) on Wednesday met with some House Republicans who sent a letter to Senate GOP leaders last week urging them to make big changes to the legislation they had nonetheless voted for.

“I think that that was important,” Murkowski said of last week’s letter. “I think they’re raising the same kinds of concerns that we are raising on the Senate side. It’s much of the same in terms of — how can you allow for a longer phase out for some of these credits, the issue of transferability. I don’t think that there’s anything new, but I think it is important that it’s being reinforced on both sides.”

Groups representing a host of interests have been ratcheting up lobbying.

Advanced Energy United and Republican-led Built for America are among those running ads. Built for America has been trying to reach the president and his allies on Fox News and Truth Social, POLITICO reported.

The Solar Energy Industries Association is planning a rally on Capitol Hill with workers next week.

The trucking industry and allied trade associations sent a letter to Senate leaders asking to preserve the 30C tax credit, which applies to alternative fueling equipment installed at homes or businesses. It can include electric charging for cars and heavy-duty trucks. The House version of the bill would phase out the credits at the end of 2025.

“This short runway threatens to strand investments that have already been made in good faith based on the credit’s availability, especially for projects that have begun construction but will not be completed by year-end,” the letter said.

The GOP is up against a self-imposed Independence Day deadline to send legislation to Trump’s desk. Many continue to say publicly that timeline is achievable, though Sen. John Curtis (R-Utah) said Tuesday “a lot of us would be surprised if it passed by July Fourth.”",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/99/2c/cdebfe964ae197e6a1e4b0b7c79b/congress-tax-cuts-40899.jpg,N,,2025-06-12 23:41:15.699171

The facility, designed to be a “factory of the future,” will be fully digital and artificial intelligence-driven to outpace legacy original equipment manufacturers by ramping up faster, cutting unit costs, boosting quality and hardening supply chain.

JetZero’s headquarters will officially move from Long Beach, California, to Greensboro once the site is operational. The company plans to break ground on the facility in the first half of 2026.

The company’s Z4 planes are equipped with seating for 250 passengers, at up to 50% better fuel efficiency than today’s commercial tube and wing jets. The company plans to have its first commercial airplanes delivered by the early 2030s.

“I am thrilled to welcome JetZero and its 14,000 good-paying jobs and unprecedented innovation to Guilford County,” said Gov. Josh Stein. “From first in flight to now the future of flight, North Carolina and our skilled workforce are soaring.”

North Carolina is uniquely positioned to support Jet Zero’s growth, with a plentiful and skilled labor force of 5.5 million, and more than 49,000 engineers. Additionally, the state is the nation's leading manufacturing workforce in the Southeast, and with more than 30,000 STEM degrees awarded annually — the state provides a strong, sustainable talent pipeline for years to come.

“North Carolina offers the ideal combination of talent, infrastructure, and forward-thinking leadership to support our mission to reshape aviation,” said Tom O’Leary, CEO and co-founder of JetZero. “This facility is a critical milestone in bringing our all-wing Z4 to market. I applaud the leadership of Gov. Josh Stein and his team as well as the leadership of the North Carolina General Assembly, and a whole host of local leaders and organizations for working with us to bring JetZero to North Carolina, the birthplace of aviation.”

Additionally, North Carolina provides an attractive business climate for companies like JetZero. Ranked by CNBC as a top three state for business for five consecutive years,, the state has the lowest corporate tax rate at 2.25% and falling%, and a cost of living 5% below the national average. Well aligned with JetZero's commitment to sustainability, North Carolina also offers low cost of energy and has a bipartisan approach to renewable energy leadership and sustainability.

“North Carolina is one of the top eight states in the nation in research funding and expenditures, but we rank considerably lower in converting research into local gross domestic product,” said Martin. “Through partnerships with key companies like JetZero and clustering around industries like aviation, we will significantly accelerate impact in converting research into GDP and keeping innovation in North Carolina rather than seeing it move to other states.”

“This announcement is a testament to North Carolina’s growing reputation as a magnet for aerospace innovation and top-tier STEM talent,” said Christopher Chung, CEO of the Economic Development Partnership of North Carolina. “With our rapidly growing population and dynamic workforce, we're attracting industry leaders to create quality jobs that will strengthen our local economy and communities across the state.”

The JetZero facility will create thousands of direct advanced manufacturing and engineering jobs, and indirect and induced jobs via suppliers and services providers. Jobs offered at the facility will have average wages above $89,000 per year. Additionally, becoming the next aerospace hub in the U.S. will create significant opportunities for North Carolina students, from high school and community college graduates to degree holders from the state’s higher education system.

“This is a pivotal point for our region,” said Alfredo Romero, Ph.D., Department of Economics chair at A&T’s Willie A. Deese College of Business and Economics. “It’s going to make the Triad a major player in advanced manufacturing, a major player in clean technology, and it will boost our economy for decades to come.”

The nation’s largest historically Black university for 11 consecutive years, A&T prepares students to advance the human condition and facilitate economic growth in North Carolina and beyond. As part of this mission, the university has played a critical role in attracting global manufacturing companies such as Boom Supersonic, Honda, Corning, Merck, Toyota and Apple to the region and state.

“North Carolina A&T is at the epicenter of these efforts in the Piedmont Triad. Like JetZero, we are future focused and driven by innovation. JetZero is changing air travel, A&T is changing higher education,” said Martin. “We are leading in the development of a lucrative technology ecosystem in the Triad that will benefit JetZero as well as other advanced manufacturing, aviation and space technology businesses.

“I look forward to the outstanding opportunities that our graduates, our faculty researchers and our community will have with JetZero and to continuing to build a collaborative relationship with our new neighbors as we welcome them to Greensboro.”",https://www.ncat.edu/news/2025/06/jetzero-aircraft-in-hangar.png,N,,2025-06-12 23:46:50.206391

Hydrogen UK’s head of policy and analysis, Brett Ryan, said: We welcome today’s announcement on hydrogen transport and storage infrastructure.
Hydrogen networks are essential for a secure and resilient hydrogen sector, whilst ensuring sufficient energy storage capacity will be critical to energy security and affordability during the energy transition.
Dr Emma Guthrie, CEO of the Hydrogen Energy Association, said: This announcement is a key piece of the puzzle and represents very welcome government support to galvanise the UK’s regional hydrogen hubs.
It’s a vital step forward on the UK’s journey to becoming a clean energy superpower.","Thousands of clean energy jobs will be created in Britain’s industrial heartlands as the government confirms over £500 million for hydrogen infrastructure today, as part of the Plan for Change to invest in Britain’s future as a clean energy superpower.

The government has confirmed that the spending review allocated landmark new funding to create the UK’s first regional hydrogen transport and storage network, connecting hydrogen producers with vital end users, including power stations and industry for the first time.

This major infrastructure boost will help deliver clean energy while creating thousands of skilled jobs in industrial regions such as Merseyside, Teesside and the Humber, as well as in the supply chain. This will ensure communities across the country feel the benefits of Britain’s renewal while reducing reliance on volatile international fossil fuel markets.

Today’s announcement also follows confirmation in the Spending Review that the government is creating thousands of clean energy jobs across the country, with 10,000 jobs to be created at Sizewell C in Suffolk, a new fusion reactor to be built on the site of an old power station in Nottinghamshire, up to 3,000 jobs created through the small modular reactor programme, and funding to kickstart the Acorn project in Scotland and the Viking project in the Humber.

This investment builds on the 4,000 jobs already set to be created in CCUS projects in the North West and Teesside.

This will support manufacturing sectors likely to require hydrogen like iron, steel, glass, chemicals and ceramics – and forms part of government’s long-term plan to invest in and secure the country’s industrial future, with more detail expected in the upcoming Infrastructure Strategy.

Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said:

We are investing over half a billion pounds in our industrial heartlands to deliver jobs and energy security for Britain. By building hydrogen networks, we are securing homegrown energy that will power British industry for generations to come.

This will bring in the investment needed across the country to deliver our Plan for Change by unlocking clean energy and growth in our local economies.

The funding will unlock hydrogen’s unique role in Britain’s energy system, where it can decarbonise industrial sectors including refineries and heavy transport, while providing long-term energy storage that can be deployed during peak demand periods.

The funding also enables progress on supporting low carbon hydrogen production through continued Hydrogen Allocation Rounds (HAR), building on the success of the First Hydrogen Allocation Round which saw 11 projects being allocated over £2 billion in government funding.

Hydrogen UK’s head of policy and analysis, Brett Ryan, said:

We welcome today’s announcement on hydrogen transport and storage infrastructure. Hydrogen networks are essential for a secure and resilient hydrogen sector, whilst ensuring sufficient energy storage capacity will be critical to energy security and affordability during the energy transition. We look forward to working with the government as we continue to deliver hydrogen’s role in reaching net zero and ensuring our energy security.

Dr Emma Guthrie, CEO of the Hydrogen Energy Association, said:

This announcement is a key piece of the puzzle and represents very welcome government support to galvanise the UK’s regional hydrogen hubs. By investing in transport and storage infrastructure, the government is rightly joining the dots, connecting already supported hydrogen production with end users across power and industry.

This strategic thinking builds on the strength of our established industrial regions and supported clusters, unlocking clean energy potential while creating skilled jobs in places such as Merseyside, Teesside and the Humber. It’s a vital step forward on the UK’s journey to becoming a clean energy superpower.

Hydrogen has already attracted £400 million of private sector investment in towns and cities such as Milford Haven in Wales and High Marnham in Nottinghamshire, and government support will help create thousands of jobs in the sector, including roles for apprentices, graduates and technically trained professionals, such as engineers, welders, skilled construction workers, pipefitters and operations specialists.",https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/684afd9c31f1fc7d0801aba9/s960_GFX2506-039-hydrogen_funding-govuk.png,N,,2025-06-12 23:31:19.180243

Clean energy is one of the S2J2 plan’s flagship industry clusters, alongside circular manufacturing and sustainable agriculture, and is projected to generate over 70,000 new jobs and $10 billion in clean energy investment by 2045.
North Valley THRIVE, here in the northernmost part of the Valley, is helping design our own clean energy future.
Kern County has long leveraged energy infrastructure investments into the community and is embracing clean energy as an integral part of future economic development.
The benefits of clean energy, along with the energy itself, should be delivered to the communities that host the energy infrastructure.","California’s clean energy policies are among the most ambitious in the world. Under SB 100, the state must achieve 100% zero-carbon electricity sales by 2045—requiring a massive buildout of new energy generation, supporting infrastructure, and clean fuel technologies. To meet these goals, California will need to more than quadruple its clean electricity supply, modernize its electric grid, and repurpose land and industrial assets at an unprecedented scale.

The San Joaquin Valley (SJV) is central to California’s clean energy transition, with abundant solar and biomass resources, an existing industrial base, skilled labor, academic institutions, major transportation corridors, and transmission infrastructure. These advantages position the region to lead on multiple clean energy fronts—from power generation to fuels and manufacturing—and a new opportunity to address longstanding disparities in air quality, investment, and economic mobility.

But the speed and scale of the energy buildout will depend not only on technical readiness or increased transmission capacity, but on something more fundamental: public confidence that these investments will deliver real, lasting value to local communities. As evidenced by CATF’s recent work in New England, social acceptance is emerging as a make-or-break factor for energy development across the county. A recent study found that, according to project developers, community opposition and restrictive local ordinances as a leading cause of project delays and cancellations. California is seeing these dynamics, with six counties—including several in the Valley—adopting restrictions on wind or solar development.

Energizing the transition in the San Joaquin Valley

The SJV is uniquely positioned to benefit from state policies driving the clean energy transition, and statewide analyses have underscored the SJV’s potential to host significant solar, wind, and transmission infrastructure crucial for meeting California’s climate goals.

Yet, the region also grapples with substantial challenges, including strained water resources, transitioning agricultural lands, a commodity-based economy that delivers few, quality jobs for its residents, and concentrated air and water pollution that have disproportionately impacted its communities. As agriculture and oil—two of its historic economic pillars—undergo transformative shifts, clean energy investments present an opportunity to drive economic growth, create high-quality jobs, and address long-standing inequities if the right level of strategic investments are made in the region.

Over the course of 2023 and 2024, CATF and our project team engaged local governments, community leaders, subject matter experts, and state agencies to explore what a clean energy future might look like in the SJV. The goal was to support the region in proactively shaping this transition—identifying preferred technologies, economic development strategies, and community benefit models that reflect both local priorities and statewide goals. This work aimed to strengthen the foundation for long-term success by supporting communities to see themselves as partners and drivers of the clean energy economy, rather than just hosts. CATF convened multiple knowledge-sharing sessions, supported by detailed quantitative modeling from RAND Corporation, with facilitated discussion on the tradeoffs and opportunities of various clean energy pathways. Discussions were grounded in a set of community-defined clean energy objectives that emphasized equity, high road jobs, wealth creation, public health, and building on existing assets.

We believe that a collaborative, integrated approach to planning for a clean energy future can guide clean energy and economic development investments that result in meaningful and transformative change for the region. This work tested that approach – and now, a year after we wrapped our facilitated engagement, we have more evidence to support that theory holds true.

Here, we highlight the progress and momentum local community leaders have spearheaded over the last year, and a look at what comes next.

Building the foundation for California jobs first

The economic development strategies, technology pathways, and community benefit models identified through CATF’s engagement in the SJV directly informed three major regional economic plans under California Jobs First (formerly the Community Economic Resilience Fund). California Jobs First is a $450 million state initiative aimed at empowering regions across the state to develop their own investment plans for building inclusive, climate-resilient economies. Much like the CATF-led effort, the California Jobs First process emphasized proactive planning, scenario modeling, and community-defined priorities—including high-road job creation, equitable investment, and coordinated permitting.

The S2J2 plan —representing Fresno, Madera, Tulare, and Kings counties—placed clean energy and fuels as a core part of its economic recovery strategy. The plan identifies energy as a foundational driver for regional revitalization, recognizing that the Valley is not just a site for deployment, but a place where clean energy innovation, development, and business activity across the clean energy value chain can be anchored. Clean energy is one of the S2J2 plan’s flagship industry clusters, alongside circular manufacturing and sustainable agriculture, and is projected to generate over 70,000 new jobs and $10 billion in clean energy investment by 2045.

Our region is poised to add 29 GW of clean energy electricity capacity by 2045, and the S2J2 Plan outlines strategies for how to include our local economy and communities as participants and benefactors of that economic growth.

Ashley Swearengin, President & CEO, CVCF

The North Valley Thrive Plan – representing San Joaquin, Stanislaus, and Merced counties – focuses on developing a high-road economy with four priority sectors: advanced manufacturing, clean energy, carbon management, and the circular bioeconomy. An organized approach to community benefits became a priority for the region, informed by the guiding principles established in the Valley wide effort.

Many of us in the Central Valley are taking on big opportunities, buoyed by the California Jobs First initiative. North Valley THRIVE, here in the northernmost part of the Valley, is helping design our own clean energy future. The timing of our collaboration with CATF was perfect – it informed our strategic planning and continues to shape our ambitious vision for clean energy. Beyond the thought partnership, we connected with a community of like-minded colleagues that were also reconciling resident voice and the needs of business and the agriculture community with the once-in-a-generation opportunity of this work.

Eric Serrato, Director North Valley Thrive & Executive Director, Merced County Workforce Development Board

Kern County’s Regional Plan focuses on three industries to leverage for economic development: clean energy, advanced manufacturing, and agriculture. Kern County has long leveraged energy infrastructure investments into the community and is embracing clean energy as an integral part of future economic development.

Advocating for community-determined community benefits

Clean energy infrastructure and investment can bring a range of positive local impacts – cleaner air, a more reliable grid, tax revenue, and jobs. Community benefits, formalized through signed agreements or other programs, can further boost these positive impacts, particularly for the host communities who may not always directly or tangibly feel the broader benefits. Additionally, well organized community benefits and trusted relationships between project developers and host communities can provide something incredibly valuable in an evolving project landscape – certainty. As an incentive to developers and clean energy proponents, projects with community partnerships and local acceptance stand the greatest chance of success.

During CATF’s engagement, SJV leaders identified lasting community benefits as a cornerstone to the clean energy transition and developed a set of guiding principles for projects. For too long in the Valley, the benefits of agricultural and fossil fuel industries have not been distributed equitably, and have left behind a legacy of environmental degradation, public health concerns, and insufficient local economic development. SJV leaders envision a different reality for clean energy, one where community benefits are a pre-requisite for all proposed projects, are equally experienced by all communities, and are determined by communities. Implementing this vision requires 1) intensive on-the-ground community engagement by trusted local organizers, and 2) close coordination among local governments. Momentum is already building.

In Western Fresno County, the non-profit Rural Communities Rising (RCR) formed in 2024 in response to the energy deployment potential identified by CATF and in anticipation of 200,000 acres of idle or fallowed agricultural lands that will be transitioned to utility-scale solar, battery storage, and green hydrogen facilities. RCR is a non-profit dedicated to connecting the area’s rural, historically underserved communities to collaboratively navigate the opportunities and significant changes brought by clean energy development. RCR is putting forward a new model aimed at developing robust community benefit agreements directly with impacted communities and streamlining and providing support for desirable clean energy projects.

Among others on our Fresno County team, I participated in the San Joaquin Valley engagement process sponsored by CATF in 2023-2024. This process not only produced a very valuable report we continue to use and share. It generated knowledge and conviction we needed to establish and grow Rural Communities Rising as an authentic self-determined community voice, organized to support the timely and efficient development of clean energy projects with community benefit agreements based on impacted community needs and project partnerships.

Felipe Perez, Board President, Rural Communities Rising

The Central Valley Community Foundation (CVCF) is another leader on community benefits in the Valley, as evidenced by a robust community benefits framework established in the S2J2 plan. The framework laid out by the S2J2 coalition recognizes that the typical approaches to community benefits have not been sufficient to “break cycles of economic extraction and improve the region’s socioeconomic, health, and wellbeing.” Their envisioned framework builds off the guiding principles for community benefits developed by CATF and local leaders. Their framework emphasizes capturing benefits through a consistent approach across the valley, with clear and specific requirements for developers, and distributing those benefits in an equitable and inclusive manner.

Delivering the promise – what comes next?

The most significant barrier to expanding clean energy capacity – and realizing the associated economic and community benefits – is the transmission infrastructure needed to move generated power to users across the grid. Not only does California have an aging grid that needs to be upgraded or replaced, but entirely new transmission infrastructure is urgently needed to meet growing electricity demand and connect new resources to the grid.

Yet that new infrastructure comes with a hefty price tag that directly impacts ratepayers, with no guarantee of local benefits or reduced energy rates for the communities hosting the energy. CAISO’s 2024 20-Year Outlook identified $46 to $63 billion of new high-voltage transmission to achieve the state’s SB 100 goal. Despite being one of the most productive regions for energy in the country, the SJV, along with the rest of the state, have some of the highest electricity rates in the country, with rates increasing quickly in recent years. Innovative models are needed to finance and build infrastructure while both protecting ratepayers and delivering local benefits to where the energy is both generated and connected into the grid.

In 2024, CATF and Net Zero California (NZC) commissioned research to evaluate whether alternative transmission financing tools such as bonds, loans, and public-private partnerships can lower costs, mitigate ratepayer impacts, and accelerate grid modernization. Our research suggests that adopting a public-private partnership approach could deliver considerable savings, potentially reducing costs by up to $3 billion annually, or around $123 billion over 40 years. Such an idea is gaining traction with recent legislation at the state level developed out of CATF’s findings, including in AB 825 (Petrie-Norris). Other models include establishing a Clean Energy Infrastructure Authority as envisioned in SB 254 (Becker) as part of the recent CA Senate’s energy affordability package, and SB 330 (Padilla) which would authorize the Governor to establish one or more transmission infrastructure pilot projects that would achieve ratepayer savings.

Other innovative approaches to financing that bring the benefits back to host communities are in the works. In March of 2024, PG&E announced efforts to raise $1 billion in funding for transmission infrastructure investments across northern and central California by leasing segments of its line to Citizens Energy – a non-profit that has played a role in energy ventures since 1979. Under the model, Citizens Energy provides money to lease a segment of the line, guaranteeing them a rate of return similar to the utility. However, as a non-profit they reinvest 50% of the profits back into the impacted communities with programs and projects specifically targeted at expanding clean energy access to low-income communities. Citizens Energy has previously taken stake in two major transmission lines in California, the Sunrise Powerlink and Sycamore-Peñasquitos line, both developed by SDG&E. Profits from those programs went to building a community solar facility and expanding access to electric vehicle infrastructure in impacted communities.

The benefits of clean energy, along with the energy itself, should be delivered to the communities that host the energy infrastructure. These projects can be integrated explicitly into some of the region’s biggest projects, as well as municipal and community scale projects.

Modeled on success

The progress over the last year was ignited by a proactive and coordinated effort to bring the region together around shared challenges and opportunities. It is a theory of change we believe will continue to prove successful, but only because it was built on a foundation of visionary local leadership and communities who are open to embracing change when tied to real, local benefits. Still, this is only the beginning.

While the SJV has its own unique circumstances, the lessons learned here hold value far beyond. This model offers a replicable blueprint for regions and states across the country who are facing a similar inflection point. Those who engage early, leveraging the clean energy development in alignment with long term community goals, will be the best positioned to lead and benefit from the transition ahead.",https://cdn.catf.us/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/24180907/san-joaquin-valley-stanislaus-ca-web.jpg,N,,2025-06-12 23:31:24.315541

Our Constitution does not allow one State special status to create standards that limit consumer choice and impose an electric vehicle mandate upon the entire Nation.
It can never again be misused to regulate greenhouse gas emissions, which inherently do not have localized effects, much less compelling and extraordinary local effects, or vehicle emissions across the Nation.","Today, I signed into law (1) H.J. Res. 87, “Joint Resolution providing congressional disapproval under chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, of the rule submitted by the Environmental Protection Agency relating to ‘California State Motor Vehicle and Engine Pollution Control Standards; Heavy-Duty Vehicle and Engine Emission Warranty and Maintenance Provisions; Advanced Clean Trucks; Zero Emission Airport Shuttle; Zero-Emission Power Train Certification; Waiver of Preemption; Notice of Decision’”; (2) H.J. Res. 88, “Joint Resolution providing congressional disapproval under chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, of the rule submitted by the Environmental Protection Agency relating to ‘California State Motor Vehicle and Engine Pollution Control Standards; Advanced Clean Cars II; Waiver of Preemption; Notice of Decision’”; and (3) H.J. Res. 89, “Joint Resolution providing congressional disapproval under chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, of the rule submitted by the Environmental Protection Agency relating to ‘California State Motor Vehicle and Engine and Nonroad Engine Pollution Control Standards; The ‘Omnibus’ Low NOX Regulation; Waiver of Preemption; Notice of Decision’”.

These bipartisan measures prevent California’s attempt to impose a nationwide electric vehicle mandate and to regulate national fuel economy by regulating carbon emissions. Because of the joint resolutions I signed today, California’s Advanced Clean Cars II, Advanced Clean Trucks, and Omnibus Low NOX programs are fully and expressly preempted by the Clean Air Act and cannot be implemented.

Preemption of these programs is essential to preserving the Constitution’s allocation of power both among the States and between the States and the Federal Government. It is the Federal Government, not States, that should establish vehicle emissions standards given the inherently interstate nature of air quality; a patchwork of State vehicle regulations on this subject is unworkable. Our Constitution does not allow one State special status to create standards that limit consumer choice and impose an electric vehicle mandate upon the entire Nation.

As the Congress’s joint resolutions make clear, California’s attempts to impose an electric vehicle mandate, regulate national fuel economy, and regulate greenhouse gas emissions are not eligible for waivers of preemption under section 209 of the Clean Air Act. This provision of the Clean Air Act authorizes the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to grant waivers to California to address only compelling and extraordinary localized issues. It can never again be misused to regulate greenhouse gas emissions, which inherently do not have localized effects, much less compelling and extraordinary local effects, or vehicle emissions across the Nation.

Under the Congressional Review Act, the EPA cannot approve any future waivers that are “substantially the same” as those disapproved in the joint resolutions. The core of the waivers at issue are their authorization of California to regulate greenhouse gas and NOX emissions from internal combustion engines and to impose what amounts to an electric vehicle mandate across the Nation. Accordingly, the joint resolutions prohibit the EPA from approving future waivers for California that would impose California’s policy goals across the entire country and violate fundamental constitutional principles of federalism, ending the electric vehicle mandate for good.",https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/WH47-Social-Share-Card.jpg,N,,2025-06-12 23:35:11.823987

NASA and the European Copernicus Climate Change Service also rated May 2025 as the second-warmest May on record, behind only 2024. Data from the Japan Meteorological Agency and Berkeley Earth were not available at the time of this writing. May 2025 was only the second month in the last 23 months for which the global-average surface air temperature was not more than 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, according to the European Copernicus Climate Change Service. Prior to the past 23 months, only five months (January-March 2016 and January-February 2020) had previously been above that level.

Global land areas had their second-warmest May on record in 2025, and global oceans also had their second-warmest May, according to NOAA. Asia and South America had their third-warmest May on record; North America its sixth-warmest; Africa, its seventh-warmest; Europe, Oceania, and the Antarctic region had a warmer-than-average May, but their May temperature did not rank among the 10 warmest Mays on record. Northern Hemisphere snow cover during May 2025 was the 14th-lowest since 1967.

According to NOAA, the year-to-date-period (Jan-May) has been the second-warmest on record for the globe, behind only 2024. NOAA gave a >99.9% chance that 2025 would wind up as a top-five warmest year on record; a 23% chance of it being the second-warmest year on record; and a less than 1% chance of being the warmest year on record.

Second warmest spring on record globally and in the contiguous U.S.

During meteorological spring (March-May) in the Northern Hemisphere in 2025, the globe had its second-warmest such period on record. The global land-only surface temperature during March-May was the highest on record

The springtime contiguous U.S. average temperature was 3.2°F (1.8°C) above average, making it the second-warmest spring in the 131-year record. North Carolina recorded its second-warmest spring, while Georgia, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, and Virginia each matched or exceeded their third-warmest spring on record.

During May, the average temperature in the contiguous U.S. ranked in the warmest third of historical Mays extending back to 1895. Alabama had its wettest May on record, while Maryland, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and Vermont each recorded their second wettest.

U.S. tornadoes in May numbered 333, with 16 being EF2 or stronger. The preliminary total of 1,113 U.S. tornadoes observed from January 1 to June 9 ranks as the third-highest year-to-date total since 2010, behind 2011 (1,736) and 2024 (1,175). May had 27 tornado deaths in the U.S., bringing the tornado death toll for the year so far to 62.

Neutral conditions (neither La Niña nor El Niño) prevail

The weak La Niña conditions in the Eastern Pacific that began in December ended in March, and neutral conditions are now present, NOAA reported in its June monthly discussion of the state of the El Niño/Southern Oscillation, or ENSO. ENSO is a recurring ocean-and-atmosphere pattern that warms and cools the eastern tropical Pacific through El Niño and La Niña events that last from one to three years. According to NOAA’s June forecast, ENSO-neutral conditions are likely (82% chance) through August 2025, but we may flip into a La Niña event during the coming Northern Hemisphere winter, with a 41% chance of La Niña and a 48% chance of ENSO-neutral conditions prevailing during the December-February period. For the upcoming Atlantic hurricane season (August-September-October), the May 19 forecast from the Columbia University International Research Institute for Climate and Society called for a 31% chance of La Niña, a 54% chance of ENSO-neutral, and a 15% chance of El Niño. El Niño conditions tend to suppress Atlantic hurricane activity through an increase in wind shear, but La Niña conditions tend to have the opposite effect.

While El Niño events often last only one year (usually from northern fall to northern spring, as in 2023-24), La Niña events often restrengthen or recur across two or even three years in a row, as was the case from mid-2020 to early 2023. Over the last two decades (2005-2024), the peak three months of hurricane season have included five El Niño periods, seven La Niña periods, and eight neutral periods.

Arctic sea ice: 7th-lowest May extent on record

Arctic sea ice in May 2025 had the seventh-lowest extent in the 47-year satellite record, according to the National Snow and Ice Data Center, or NSIDC. The Arctic had its fourth-warmest May on record in 2025. A record heat wave in Greenland during May caused unprecedented melting of the island’s ice sheet (see skeet above). According to Friederike Otto of the World Weather Attribution group, without human-caused climate change, such an event would have been “basically impossible”.

Antarctic sea ice extent in May was the fifth-lowest in the 47-year satellite record. The Antarctic had above-average temperatures in May that did not rank in the top ten warmest Mays.

,EPA,2025-06-12 22:53:53+00:00,POLITICO,White House looks to freeze more agency funds — and expand executive power - POLITICO,"Scott Waldman, Corbin Hiar",,,,,https://www.politico.com/news/2025/06/12/white-house-agency-funds-executive-power-00395545,"The order to freeze some funding at more than a dozen agencies comes in advance of a budget spending “deferrals” package that the White House plans to send Congress.
Spending deferrals allow the executive branch to temporarily prevent authorized dollars from going out the door — but only if lawmakers sign off on the move.
The person said the White House directive was communicated largely to agencies over the phone to avoid creating a paper trail.
The White House strategy is to delay or block funds now, then craft an additional rescissions package later in the year that would make such cuts permanent.
That means the deferrals package strategy is likely the start of a significant and questionable push to expand executive power, said Carlile, the former OMB associate director.","The architect of the freeze directive, OMB Director Russ Vought, has long lamented the limits placed on the president’s ability to direct federal spending. His latest gambit — first reported by E&E News — appears designed to test those boundaries.

The agencies targeted by the newest freeze include the Environmental Protection Agency, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the National Science Foundation and the departments of Interior and Health and Human Services. E&E News granted anonymity to the two people familiar with the strategy so they could speak freely without fear of reprisal from the Trump administration.

OMB’s targets include NSF research and education programs that operate using funding leftover from 2024. Also on the list are tens of millions of dollars for national park operations as well as more than $100 million in science spending at NASA, which includes climate research.

While the president has some measure of control over how federal agencies spend their money, the power of the purse lies primarily with Congress under the U.S. Constitution. Put another way: Lawmakers set the budget.

Vought is trying to turn that principle on its head.

The order to freeze some funding at more than a dozen agencies comes in advance of a budget spending “deferrals” package that the White House plans to send Congress. Spending deferrals allow the executive branch to temporarily prevent authorized dollars from going out the door — but only if lawmakers sign off on the move.

Freezing the spending before making that request seems to fly in the face of Congress’ constitutional power and the 1974 Impoundment Control Act, said Joseph Carlile, former associate director at OMB in the Biden administration.

“There is a right, a legal way, for the administration to rescind things and I guess they’re pursuing this because they don’t have their stuff together or don’t care about the law,” said Carlile, who also worked previously on budgetary oversight on the House Appropriations Committee for 13 years.

“This is consistent with an administration that believes that they have broader powers around budget and spending than any other administration has ever been able to find,” Carlile added.

White House officials did not deny the new strategy when asked about it. Rather, they described it as a way to lock in spending cuts prescribed by the Department of Government Efficiency, a cost-cutting outfit championed by Trump donor and entrepreneur Elon Musk.

Yet the White House has worked to keep the effort quiet, said one person in the administration with direct knowledge of the strategy. The person said the White House directive was communicated largely to agencies over the phone to avoid creating a paper trail.

Vought has said repeatedly he disagrees with the impoundment act, a Nixon-era law that limits the president’s ability to block spending for political reasons. Democrats and legal scholars have said Trump already has violated the law.

“We’re not in love with the law,” Vought told CNN in an interview on June 1.

The separate $9.4 billion rescissions package that the House approved Thursday would permanently cut funding for NPR and PBS as well as foreign aid. Vought has said he expects to send more rescissions packages to Congress.

Vought’s multipronged strategy also is likely to include a “pocket rescissions” strategy, by which the White House intentionally runs out the clock near the Sept. 30 end of the fiscal year. If the president introduces a recissions package then, Congress has a limited time to act — and if it does not do so, the funds slated for elimination are automatically canceled.

The White House may use the pocket rescissions strategy if the $9.4 billion rescissions package does not pass both chambers of Congress, the administration person said. And it could pursue another pocket rescissions strategy centered on Labor Department spending.

The deferrals package is a third strategy — and it comes ahead of an expected congressional fight on lifting the debt ceiling before the end of the summer. It would essentially pause or significantly slow funding intentionally, until it can be crafted into a separate pocket rescissions package that can run down the clock and be made permanent.

Under the impoundment law, the White House can ask Congress to defer some of its budget spending authority “to provide for contingencies” or “to achieve savings” through efficiency gains. The White House is planning to argue that hitting the debt ceiling — a borrowing limit imposed and periodically raised by Congress — is such a contingency.

The nation is expected to reach the debt ceiling by the end of August.

The White House strategy is to delay or block funds now, then craft an additional rescissions package later in the year that would make such cuts permanent.

“OMB is hard at work making the DOGE cuts permanent using a wide range of tools we have at our disposal under the ICA [Impoundment Control Act] and within the President’s authority— just like the first rescissions package that was sent up to the Hill this week,” OMB spokesperson Rachel Cauley said in a statement Monday. “As a part of that process, we are constantly checking in with agencies to assess their unobligated balances.”

Fight could land at Supreme Court

The latest effort may be more comprehensive than other blocks on federal funding that Vought has enacted, according to the person with direct knowledge of the move.

It could also be a “trial balloon” to see whether the White House can unilaterally block future spending if Trump administration officials object, said another person at an agency that would be affected.

The move appears to be a significant escalation of Vought’s efforts to test the boundaries of the Impoundment Control Act.

Vought’s strategy is to rely on Section 1013 of the act, which grants the president the authority to freeze spending if the administration explains its actions to lawmakers. The act originally allowed one chamber of Congress to reject presidential deferrals, a power that courts rejected. As a result, the law was amended in 1987 to limit how long presidents could delay spending and under what conditions.

“It does not appear that any measures to disapprove a deferral have been considered since these amendments were made,” the Congressional Research Service said in a February report on the impoundment law.

Vought has long argued that impounding some congressionally appropriated funding is constitutional, and he has said he wants the Supreme Court to validate what would be a significant weakening of congressional oversight of the federal budget.

The deferrals package the White House plans to send Congress would temporarily stop agencies from spending unobligated funds that remain at the end of the government’s fiscal year on Sept. 30.

The broad-based deferrals package is highly unusual and could be part of his strategy to take his fight for greater executive power to the Supreme Court, said Philip Joyce, a professor at the University of Maryland’s School of Public Policy and author of the book “The Congressional Budget Office: Honest Numbers, Power, and Policymaking.”

“It is a novel approach, but I think in the end, they really want this to go to the Supreme Court,” Joyce said. “They think they know how the Supreme Court is going to rule and once the Supreme Court opens the door, you know, it’s kind of high noon for the separation of powers, which is what they want.”

Last week, OMB officials reached out to federal agencies to tell them to enact the spending freeze. Some agency officials were “shocked” at the move, according to the administration official with direct knowledge of the plan.

The head of the National Science Foundation’s budget office didn’t know what to make of the directive, according to an email obtained by E&E News.

OMB is targeting the agency’s research and education “accounts for a deferral package,” NSF Budget Director Caitlyn Fife wrote last Friday in a note to top officials.

“I imagine you will all have questions, as do we,” she said. “However we are immediately focused on pulling the funds back to ensure there are no further commitments or obligations.”

An NSF official briefed on the spending freeze said offices relying on previous-year funding could see their “programs gutted.” The official also predicted that if OMB’s ploy succeeds, it will use deferrals to impound any congressionally directed spending the administration opposes.

That means the deferrals package strategy is likely the start of a significant and questionable push to expand executive power, said Carlile, the former OMB associate director.

He said the White House is essentially seeking to subvert the Constitution, which grants Congress spending authority, in such an extreme way that it threatens the nation’s democratic structure.

“I think it upends a fundamental check and balance contemplated in our Constitution, and I don’t understand how you subordinate Congress’ power of the purse,” Carlile said.

Federal spending decisions are “a deal between the executive and the legislative branch as institutions,” he added. “And this all starts to unravel real quick if our budgetary framework really actually meant nothing.”",https://static.politico.com/a7/74/e1ee339245af81d2d0854de52756/house-budget-32899.jpg,N,,2025-06-12 23:35:14.381364

Moreover, EPCA impliedly preempts California’s tailpipe CO2 standards because Congress authorized the Department of Transportation, not CARB, to regulate fuel economy.

Thanks to President Trump and Congress’s restoration of the rule of law, the road is now clear to achieving a more competitive auto industry, happier consumers, and a freer society.","President Trump today signed three Congressional Review Act (CRA) resolutions of disapproval to overturn Biden administration Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) waivers greenlighting California’s plans to ban sales of gas- and diesel-powered cars and trucks. This is wonderful news for motor vehicle consumers, the US auto industry, and all liberty-loving Americans.

Aided and abetted by the Obama and Biden administrations, the California Air Resources Board (CARB) was on its way to becoming the nation’s de facto Industrial Policy Czar for Climate and Cars. Moreover, California and its blue state allies were poised to exert cartel-like market power over the auto industry, increasing vehicle prices and decreasing consumer choices beyond their borders. By signing the CRA resolutions into law, President Trump ends an era of unlawful motor vehicle regulation, clearing the decks for a sea change in national policy.

Section 32919(a) of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA) preempts state laws and regulations “related to” fuel economy standards. As the first Trump administration’s One National Program (SAFE 1) Rule explained in painstaking detail, California’s tailpipe carbon dioxide (CO2) emission standards are “directly” (mathematically and physically) related to fuel economy standards, and the state’s zero emission vehicle (ZEV) mandates are “substantially” related. Consequently, EPCA 32919(a) expressly prohibits both policies.

Moreover, EPCA impliedly preempts California’s tailpipe CO2 standards because Congress authorized the Department of Transportation, not CARB, to regulate fuel economy. More pertinently, EPCA impliedly preempts California’s ZEV mandates because the federal Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) program by design protects automakers’ freedom to sell combustion engine vehicles.

Preemption statutes derive their authority from the Constitution’s Supremacy Clause (Maryland v. Louisiana, 1981). Such statutes also operate ab initio, voiding the prohibited or conflicting state policy from the moment it is adopted or enacted (Cabazon Band of Mission Indians v. Indio, 1982). EPCA turned California’s gas-car ban into a legal phantom, without force or effect, years before the Biden EPA agreed to grant a waiver for it under Section 209(b) of the Clean Air Act (CAA).

Biden EPA’s claim that it has no authority under the CAA to consider potential conflicts between California’s vehicle emissions program and EPCA is false. California requests EPA waivers precisely so that it and other states may incorporate CARB’s vehicle emission standards into their implementation plans (SIPs) for complying with national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS). CAA Section 110(e) requires each SIP to “provide assurances” that nothing in it is “prohibited by any provision of Federal or State law.”

EPA is responsible for reviewing SIPs and approving or rejecting SIP elements. Therefore, when reviewing a waiver request under CAA 209(b), EPA may not lawfully ignore potential conflicts between CARB vehicle emission standards and other federal statutes. To repeat, EPCA expressly and impliedly prohibits California’s tailpipe CO2 standards and ZEV mandates.

President Trump’s signing of the CRA resolutions terminates a long-running bureaucratic power grab that has threatened to price millions of Americans out of the market for new cars, undermine US automakers’ competitiveness by forcing them to discontinue many of their top-selling models, and rob Americans of their freedom to purchase the types of vehicles that best meet their needs.

This investment aims to supercharge Britain’s leadership in fields such as artificial intelligence, life sciences, advanced manufacturing, and clean energy, while empowering local regions to drive innovation tailored to their strengths.

Chancellor Rachel Reeves will unveil this transformative funding in next week’s Spending Review, announcing a commitment to £22.5 billion annually by 2029/30. The funding will support breakthroughs ranging from next-generation medicines and long-lasting batteries to cutting-edge AI technologies, expected to create thousands of high-skilled jobs and deliver billions in economic returns.

“Britain is the home of science and technology. Through the Plan for Change, we are investing in Britain’s renewal to create jobs, protect our security against foreign threats and make working families better off,” said Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves.

A key feature of the plan is up to £500 million for local innovation across the UK. Through a new Local Innovation Partnerships Fund, regions will have the power to shape how R&D investment is spent based on local expertise and economic needs.

“Incredible and ambitious research goes on in every corner of our country… empowering regions to harness local expertise and skills for all of our benefit is at the heart of this new funding,” said Science and Technology Secretary Peter Kyle.

This means that cities and towns will now be in the driver’s seat when it comes to economic renewal, Liverpool will expand its life sciences sector to accelerate drug discovery, Northern Ireland will focus on defence technologies to strengthen national security and South Wales will invest in semiconductor design to power devices from smartphones to electric vehicles.

The new funding builds on the momentum from the Innovation Accelerator pilot, which saw regional partnerships drive real-world benefits. For example, Greater Manchester’s diagnostic accelerator developed faster, cheaper tests for heart, liver, and lung diseases, while Moonbility in the West Midlands applied AI to predict rail disruptions in real time.

Research and development is already a powerful economic engine in the UK, underpinning 3 million jobs. According to the government, every £1 invested in R&D returns up to £7 in economic benefit, and businesses receiving their first R&D grants see over 20 percent increases in jobs and revenue.

Alongside this, nearly £5 million will fund a new partnership between Manchester and Cambridge, linking two innovation hubs to attract business investment and share best practices globally.

Regional leaders are welcoming the funding as a game changer

“This is exactly how we turn our potential into progress. This investment backs regions to lead the way in the industries that will define the future,” “It will drive innovation that not only grows the economy but creates jobs, builds opportunity, improves health and changes lives.” said Richard Parker, Mayor of the West Midlands.

North East Mayor Kim McGuinness added

“This announcement boosts my mission to create new growth, new jobs and new opportunities… from the car industry and green energy to kitchen table innovations and our fast-emerging trailblazers in the space industry and AI.”

As this year was Intersolar’s first regional show in the Midwest, Letizia said there were two things she learned that make Midwest Expo different from her experience in other markets.
Championed by environmental justice advocates, the package evolved from the two past omnibus energy bills that helped catapult Illinois to the successful solar market it is today.
“I know a lot of people are probably wondering why it didn’t pass,” Kavi Chintham, Vote Solar’s Illinois campaigns manager, said during the Illinois session, which outlined what the omnibus would have achieved.","Midwest Solar Expo held its first conference in Chicago June 9 to June 11 since it was acquired by Intersolar and Energy Storage North America last year, marking Intersolar’s expansion into the Midwest.

This year’s event included 67 exhibitors, a slight bump from the reported number in previous years, and an estimated 900 people were expected to attend the event.

Beckie Kier, Intersolar and Energy Storage North American event director, told pv magazine USA their goal for year one is to support the regional market. “As that evolves,” she said, “we will evolve the conference program and then in supporting the strong exhibit hall to provide the solutions that the attendees need.”

The Midwest Solar Expo sheds light on the innovation occurring in the Midwest, but Candace Letizia, marketing director for Intersolar and Energy Storage North America, noted the “innovation extends beyond the technology that the industry is driving forward and also into the innovation that’s occurring within the workforce,” she said, and noted that the year’s Host Sponsor was labor group Powering Chicago, a partnership group between the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) Local 134 and the Electrical Contractors’ Association (ECA) of Chicago and Cook County.

As this year was Intersolar’s first regional show in the Midwest, Letizia said there were two things she learned that make Midwest Expo different from her experience in other markets.

“The first,” she noted, “is that this ‘Midwestern hospitality’ is so true. What a great spirit this show has had,” Letizia said. “The atmosphere here has just been very collaborative and very approachable, which I find very refreshing as a northeasterner.”

Letizia said the other notable difference with the Midwest Expo is the demographic and range of professionals among its participants. The involvement from labor and union groups, she noted, is something she hasn’t seen as much of at other Intersolar shows.

Attendees extended from beyond Midwestern states, with people traveling from states such as Georgia, California, Tennessee and Pennsylvania. Frank Crandall, account representative for the Midwest and Canada at Enphase, told pv magazine USA that many of the sales reps attended the show because Midwestern states are in their sales territory.

The sessions included state policy recaps from this year’s legislative session. A theme emerged across these sessions when panelists discussed bills that were and were not successful, with panelists often discussing the involvement of groups outside solar and environmental groups as either something they had for successful legislation, or something they wish they had had for those that did not pass.

For example, Illinois recently failed to pass a powerful omnibus energy package that would have created a Storage for All program, a Solar Bill of Rights, virtual power plant programs and more. Championed by environmental justice advocates, the package evolved from the two past omnibus energy bills that helped catapult Illinois to the successful solar market it is today.

“I know a lot of people are probably wondering why it didn’t pass,” Kavi Chintham, Vote Solar’s Illinois campaigns manager, said during the Illinois session, which outlined what the omnibus would have achieved. “We need everyone to really be out there pushing for this omnibus package in the next session. Whatever session this comes up in again, whether it be the veto session or the spring — whenever — it can’t just be advocates.”

“It can’t just be industry, it can’t just be agencies,” Chintham said. “It really has to be everyone coming together and pushing for this because we understand the impacts on ratepayers and on companies that the that the RTO tightening has, that things like data centers coming into the state, those kind of impacts have. We understand that innately because we’re working on that every day, but legislators don’t necessarily understand that.”

“Sometimes they need to hear from a variety of people with different backgrounds in order to really understand the urgency of that,” she said.",https://pv-magazine-usa.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/06/PXL_20250610_1933031912_polarr-1200x894.jpeg,N,,2025-06-12 23:50:36.152529

And the report says more job losses are likely under Republicans’ proposed spending bill.

Climate Power reports more than 90,000 clean energy jobs nationwide have been lost or stalled as a result of Trump administration policies and funding cuts. In Arizona, for example, battery company Kore Power in February scrapped plans for a $1.2 billion plant that would have brought 3,000 jobs to Buckeye. The company faced uncertainty over whether it would receive a federal loan it had been counting on to fund construction.

Now, Congress is considering a spending bill that proposes to end federal tax credits for clean energy projects that had been implemented under the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. Doing away with those incentives would further threaten clean energy jobs, the Climate Power report says.

“Arizona would see enormous and immediate impacts — projects being canceled or not commencing construction at all,” said Kristina Costa, a former Biden administration energy adviser.

Costa said the Inflation Reduction Act clean energy tax credits helped create a solar and battery power boom in Arizona, with dozens of new projects announced over the last few years. If planned projects end up getting canceled, job losses would be just one concern, Costa said.

“You would also see rates for consumers rise as well because you have a basic supply and demand problem,” Costa said. “Arizona will continue to see increased load growth, but without new generation to meet that load, customers are going to end up paying more for electricity.”

Representatives for the Trump administration did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the states’ lawsuit.","President Donald Trump on Thursday blocked a series of policies across the country promoting electric vehicles, and Washington state joined in a lawsuit attempting to thwart the moves.

Trump signed joint resolutions of Congress revoking a series of waivers from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency that allowed California to promote increased sales of EVs and the phasing out of gas-powered vehicles in the coming years.

In recent years, Washington and 15 other states, alongside the District of Columbia, crafted their own electric vehicle policies on the foundation of those waivers. So when Trump blocked California’s policy promoting electric vehicles, he also blocked similar policies for all these other states.

Minutes later, California’s Attorney General Rob Bonta filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California asking for Trump’s actions to be declared unconstitutional. Trump is exerting undue pressure over states’ abilities to craft their own policies, Bonta said in his 42-page complaint.

“The Federal Government ran roughshod over federalism and separation of powers principles” in the way it has revoked these waivers, Bonta said.

Washington, Colorado, Delaware, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island and Vermont all signed onto the lawsuit as fellow plaintiffs against Trump, EPA administrator Lee Zeldin and the federal government.

How the waivers work

In 1967, Congress granted California the ability to set stronger clean air regulations than the federal government. But to enforce each of these rules, the state needs a waiver from the EPA. Other states have followed suit with California and adopted stricter standards of their own.

California used this system to set targets for increasing sales of EVs, with the goal of phasing out sales of new gas-powered cars entirely by 2035, and Washington set similar standards alongside other states. Commercial vans and trucks must also move toward electric and hybrid options, but Washington’s regulations don’t call for a full ban of gas vehicle sales in those categories.

What did Congress do?

Republicans in the U.S. House and Senate (alongside a few Democrats like Washington’s Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez) used the Congressional Review Act. This allows incoming presidential administrations to revoke regulations enacted by the previous one.

However, officials with the U.S. Government Accountability Office said this spring that these types of waivers aren’t covered by the Congressional Review Act.

Never before had Congress revoked one of California’s waivers.

What happens next?

California’s lawsuit fixates on the Congressional Review Act, arguing that the federal government may not use the law to revoke the waivers. At the same time, Bonta accuses Trump and the other defendants of violating the constitutional separation of powers, echoing a centuries-old warning from a famous French judge and philosopher Montesquieu:

“There can be no liberty where the legislative and executive powers are united in the same body, or person of magistrates.”

Bonta continued: “Put simply, the Federal Government carried out an illegal playbook designed to evade lawful procedures that might prevent the ‘take down’ of disfavored California laws.”

The attorney general asked for the federal judge to declare the congressional resolutions void and reinstate the waivers.

Washington Gov. Bob Ferguson issued a statement Thursday criticizing Trump’s latest push as shortsighted.

“The federal government’s attack on the state’s clean air authority is not only unlawful — it’s a direct threat to public health. Washington will work with our partner states to defend our right to set air quality and emissions standards,” Ferguson said.

Attorney General Nick Brown echoed the sentiment.

“Transportation is the single greatest contributor to greenhouse gas pollution in Washington, and our residents understand the transition to zero-emission vehicles is critical in this fight against climate change,” Brown said in a statement.

While the court considers this lawsuit, one of many against the Trump administration now mired in the legal process, Washington still has several options to encourage the transition away from gas-powered vehicles.

Lawmakers have said they can try to offer more rebates, expand charging infrastructure or grow access to public transportation.

“The Trump administration’s attack on clean air is breathtaking,” Weiser said in a statement Thursday.
The lawsuit is also trying to protect California and copycat laws requiring sharp cuts to nitrogen oxide pollution and clean sales targets for heavy-duty trucks.
We anticipate growing demand for EVs in Colorado regardless of what happens with federal attempts to remove state authority to enforce clean car rules.”","Colorado on Thursday joined California and other states in suing the EPA and President Donald Trump to preserve electric vehicle sales mandates meant to clean the air and cut greenhouse gases, after Trump signed Congressional resolutions that effectively canceled the programs.

Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser and other attorneys general sued in federal district court for northern California, calling the Congressional resolutions an illegal abuse of national powers and an attack on the well-established Clean Air Act.

The resolutions wiped out EPA waivers granted to California and copycat states to require far more clean car sales than minimums set at the federal level. Colorado’s mandate says 82% of new cars offered for sale here must have zero emissions by model year 2032.

Trump signed the resolutions in a televised ceremony Thursday morning, saying, “We officially rescue the U.S. auto industry from destruction by terminating California’s electric vehicle mandate, once and for all.” Colorado and more than a dozen other states following California’s lead had adopted clean car minimums — as well as subsequent clean heavy truck minimums.

California has received dozens of EPA waivers over the years to more effectively attack smog in Los Angeles and other cities. The state has the largest new car market in the country, and with so many other well-populated states following California’s lead, their clean air policies dominate car industry economics.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom and leaders from other states had already vowed to fight back.

“The Trump administration’s attack on clean air is breathtaking,” Weiser said in a statement Thursday. “Rolling back the federal Clean Air Act waivers through the illegal use of the Congressional Review Act is an assault on the authority of states, like Colorado, to adopt stronger tailpipe pollution limits than those set by the federal government. We’re in court to defend Colorado’s cost-effective clean car program, which was implemented to improve air quality, reduce harmful ozone pollution, and increase choices that Coloradans have when purchasing an electric vehicle.”

The Colorado Energy Office, which is overseeing many of the state’s greenhouse gas limits and electrification efforts, said the California waivers would need to be back in place if Colorado wanted to enforce its copycat targets. California’s target went slightly farther, extending the rising minimums through 2035 and saying all sales must be electric by then.

The states’ lawsuit claims the Congressional Review Act only allows Congress to overturn rules made by federal agencies, not state laws like the California and Colorado laws on electric vehicles. The lawsuit is also trying to protect California and copycat laws requiring sharp cuts to nitrogen oxide pollution and clean sales targets for heavy-duty trucks.

The EPA has in the past said congressional review does not apply to the waivers, Weiser and the attorneys general said.

“The federal government ran roughshod over federalism and separation of powers principles,” the lawsuit says. “In fact, the Congressional Review Act has never before been used in any context that resembles this one. It has certainly never been used, as it was here, to negate particular state laws.”

State leaders and environmental advocates want to cut both greenhouse gas emissions and the transportation pollution that contributes to toxic ozone, and they fear the rollbacks and a threatened erasure of federal EV tax credits will reverse years of clean air progress.

But conservatives who want more oil and gas drilling, and thought Democrats were interfering too much in the automobile markets, lauded Trump putting the finishing touches toward one of their longtime goals.

“One state’s overreach should never dictate how all Americans live, work, or drive,” said Congressional Western Caucus Vice Chair Rep. Jay Obernolte, R-California. “This bill sends a strong message that national standards should be set only in Washington, not in Sacramento.”

The American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers trade group said Trump “just delivered a major win for the American people by overturning California’s gas car ban and the state’s attempt to tell consumers what they can and can’t drive.”

Colorado drivers should look at where the praise is coming from, countered Travis Madsen, transportation analyst for the nonprofit clean energy group Southwest Energy Efficiency Project. “The petroleum industry will lose sales because of electrification, so they are interested in blocking or slowing down alternatives,” he said.

Colorado has a target of nearly 1 million electric vehicles on the road by 2030, and growth of EV sales has been on pace to reach that, supporters of the mandates say. Clean vehicle sales made up 26% of Colorado’s new light-duty car market in the first three months of 2025.

Most analysts are unsure if the major auto manufacturers have gone too far down the road toward EV fleets to scrap their changeover plans.

For Colorado, Madsen said, “Fortunately, we’ve built up significant momentum. Governor Polis and state leaders have done a great job making Colorado an attractive place to drive an electric vehicle. Colorado can and should continue to drive progress — although it would be a lot easier without these new obstacles the federal government is putting in our way.”

The state energy office said the Trump administration’s actions will not stop EV momentum, but could hurt consumer choices if some manufacturers pull back.

“Colorado drivers are clear: electric vehicles are here to stay, and demand will continue to grow,” CEO director Will Toor said in a statement. “Coloradans are purchasing EVs at a rate three to four times greater than that required by rules. We anticipate growing demand for EVs in Colorado regardless of what happens with federal attempts to remove state authority to enforce clean car rules.”",https://newspack-coloradosun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/AP24331826974585.jpg,N,,2025-06-12 23:29:50.025618

While the clean energy industry scrambles to lobby for the credits to be included in the Senate’s version of the bill, Bloomberg BNEF analyzed how the cancellation of the credits would affect clean energy production in the US.
Without the tax credits, solar projects would decrease 5% and energy storage projects would dip 7% in the next 10 years.
And the potential cut of the tax credits would affect more than just clean energy capacity: Bloomberg BNEF’s analysis also warned of “negative effects on the US power system,” especially as energy demand grows due to data centers.
“The stakes are high, but with growing energy demand and investor pressure, there’s still time for Congress to course-correct and support bringing more electrons to the grid.”","Clean energy tax credits have bolstered widespread investment in renewable energy since the Inflation Reduction Act passed in 2022. But President Trump has taken aim at them in his “One Big Beautiful Bill,” which passed the House of Representatives last month with cuts to key tax credits that apply to residential clean tech and clean energy production and investment.

While the clean energy industry scrambles to lobby for the credits to be included in the Senate’s version of the bill, Bloomberg BNEF analyzed how the cancellation of the credits would affect clean energy production in the US.

As stipulated in the version of the bill passed by the House, projects built more than 60 days after the bill is signed into law and that don’t start operating before 2029 would be ineligible for tax credits. According to Bloomberg BNEF’s analysis, these stipulations would create a “three-year rush to build new wind, solar, and storage projects followed by a major hangover in 2029” that would result in a 10% decrease in clean energy projects built by 2035.

Solar, wind, and storage technologies will each be impacted differently—the tax credit changes don’t apply to nuclear projects. Without the tax credits, solar projects would decrease 5% and energy storage projects would dip 7% in the next 10 years. General demand for those technologies would still exist, though at a lower level than it is today. Wind capacity, however, would be cut by a whopping 35%, “with no offshore wind additions post 2028,” Bloomberg NEF noted. Such a blow to wind technologies would be kicking them while they’re down: A considerable amount of offshore wind project production has stalled as a result of Trump’s executive orders.

And the potential cut of the tax credits would affect more than just clean energy capacity: Bloomberg BNEF’s analysis also warned of “negative effects on the US power system,” especially as energy demand grows due to data centers.

“Rapid load growth driven by data center demand will require either new generation, which this bill makes it harder to add,” Bloomberg BNEF’s analysis stated, “or higher capacity factors from existing power plants, which tend to be both more expensive and higher in greenhouse gas emissions.”

US energy demand is also being stressed by clean energy stakeholders who are currently meeting with Republican senators, urging them to protect the tax credits. Jon Powers, president of clean energy investment firm CleanCapital, told Tech Brew that in a meeting he attended with a senator on Capitol Hill, “someone...wanted to bring an AI data center to the state,” but told the senator “it wouldn’t be possible because there was not enough energy in their area to fulfill the data center’s demand.”

“Congress is now one chamber away from passing a law that would dramatically increase clean energy project risk, states would lose out on millions in investment, and ultimately cause previously announced projects and manufacturing plants to be canceled—making it more difficult to bring AI-critical data centers to fruition and jeopardizing our current infrastructure,” Powers said in an email. “The stakes are high, but with growing energy demand and investor pressure, there’s still time for Congress to course-correct and support bringing more electrons to the grid.”","https://cdn.sanity.io/images/bl383u0v/production/2766c0ff01c0b343011d69b515ac2292ed67fa59-5719x3813.jpg?rect=0,405,5719,3002&w=1200&h=630&q=70&fit=crop&auto=format",N,,2025-06-12 23:33:06.375662

This new initiative will equip local leaders with the tools and support they need to advance climate solutions that build healthier, more resilient, and economically vibrant communities.

“We are thrilled to announce this dynamic partnership and innovative program, which will equip AAMA mayors with the essential technical expertise and policy insights needed to foster impactful change in their communities,” said Phyllis Dickerson, CEO of AAMA. “We’re eager to roll up our sleeves and get to work.”

Targeted towards cities in the early stages of their climate and sustainability journeys, the program will provide ten mayors with strategic guidance, hands-on resources, and one-on-one coaching to help accelerate meaningful local progress.

Participant Mayor Katrina Evans of Campti, Louisiana, shared her enthusiasm: “Campti has already set bold climate goals, and I’m excited to join this cohort to build the capacity we need to achieve them. This program offers the tools and expertise that will help translate our vision into real progress for our community.”

Launching this month and running through February 2026, the program will feature monthly virtual training sessions covering key topics such as climate goal-setting, data-driven decision-making, community engagement, and financing and funding strategies. By the end of the program, participating mayors will:

Demonstrate Leadership through a public commitment to pollution reduction and sustainability

Define a Clear Path Forward with a tailored climate action roadmap for their community

Build Confidence and Capacity to lead effective and inclusive local initiatives

A Cohort of Committed Leaders

The inaugural cohort represents a diverse range of communities from the southeast—urban and rural, large and small—each with a shared commitment to bold, community-driven climate action. These mayors bring energy, purpose, and a clear desire to make a difference:

Mayor Jackson of Beverly Hills, Missouri

Mayor Stevens of Marianna, Arkansas

Mayor Evans of Campti, Louisiana

Mayor Mohammed of Pembroke Park, Florida

Mayor Holiday Ingraham of East Point, Georgia

Mayor Rainey of Wrightsville, Arkansas

Mayor Haygood of Tuskegee, Alabama

Mayor Robinson of Hayti Heights, Missouri

Mayor Hampton of Haynesville, Louisiana

Mayor Wood of Dumfries, Virginia

“Mayors are uniquely positioned to lead at the intersection of public health, environmental quality, and economic opportunity,” said Saharnaz Mirzazad, Executive Director of ICLEI USA. “This program uplifts that leadership and provides the support necessary to drive lasting change at the local level.”

Bold Commitments, Measurable Progress

By the program’s end, each mayor will have made a bold, community-informed commitment to reduce pollution and promote public health and sustainability.

“The mayors in this cohort are demonstrating the kind of bold, proactive leadership our climate demands,” said Tonya Calhoun, Senior Director of Community Engagement at EDF. “Their work will not only safeguard public health and well-being, but also position their communities for long-term resilience.”

This initiative highlights the pivotal role that local governments play in promoting climate resilience. ICLEI USA, EDF, and AAMA are proud to support these mayors as they lead their cities toward a more sustainable future.

California was ready.

“We made a promise that if the president attempted to illegally interfere with our clean air standards, we’d hold him accountable in court,” California Attorney General Rob Bonta said in a press briefing the same day. “Today, we are making good on that promise.”

Bonta filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California along with attorneys general from 10 states that follow California’s pioneering emissions standards. The complaint asks the court to declare that the resolutions “have no effect on the status or enforceability of state emissions control programs.”

The resolutions Trump signed repeal California’s landmark rule to ban sales of new gas-powered cars by 2035, along with two other rules passed as a result of clean air waivers granted by the Biden administration. The Republican-led Congress passed the resolutions using a tool called the Congressional Review Act—illegally, experts say—to block the state’s authority to ask the Environmental Protection Agency to grant waivers to enforce stricter standards.

“They said it couldn’t be done,” Trump said. “But boy, it’s had us tied up in knots for years.”

California’s authority to set stricter air pollution standards than the federal government dates back to the 1960s.

By the time the first national air-pollution regulations were enacted in 1967, California had already passed first-in-the-nation tailpipe standards to deal with the abundance of cars and people in Los Angeles that, combined with pollution-trapping mountains, perpetually shrouded the city in hazardous smog. Congress recognized the state’s “compelling and extraordinary circumstances,” both in having unique pollution challenges and expertise in controlling them, and directed the EPA to waive provisions barring states from passing stricter standards than those set by the federal government.

The EPA has granted California waivers in various forms more than 100 times since 1967.

When asked why the administration believes it has the right to repeal authority repeatedly granted to California under the Clean Air Act, EPA spokesperson Molly Vaseliou said, “it’s Civics 101.”

Both chambers of Congress pass legislation and the president signs it into law, Vaseliou said. “This is nothing more than California throwing a temper tantrum because the American people don’t want the state’s terrible policies. The complaint lacks merit, and we look forward to a swift dismissal.”

No Legal Authority

The complaint charges the federal government with illegally using the Congressional Review Act, or CRA, to attack California’s clean vehicles program. The Biden administration granted California three waivers to enforce that program, which includes the EV mandate to phase out sales of new gas-powered cars by 2035, as well as rules to move toward zero-emission trucks and heavy-duty vehicles.

Both the Republican-led House and Senate treated the waivers as rules so they could pass “resolutions of disapproval” and revoke the waivers, even though the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office had determined that the waivers are not rules and so are not subject to the CRA. The Senate parliamentarian, also a nonpartisan referee, later came to the same conclusion: Waivers are not rules.

“These waivers have never under any administration, Democrat or Republican, been considered rules that are subject to disapproval under the CRA,” Bonta said. “What we’re seeing is a thinly veiled attempt by the President to retaliate against California for choosing progress over regression.”

Just a few hours after Bonta spoke, Democratic California Sen. Alex Padilla, who fought Republicans’ attempts to block his state’s right to enforce the nation’s toughest clean air rules, was forcibly removed from a news conference Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem held on immigration enforcement in Los Angeles.

Padilla, a native of Los Angeles, where the Trump administration deployed the National Guard over Gov. Gavin Newsom’s objections, was wrestled to the ground and handcuffed, even though he told the agents who he was.

The day before, Padilla vowed to block all EPA nominations “until Republicans allow California to protect the health of its residents” by reinstating the waivers.

When the Senate voted last month to rescind the waivers, Democratic senators charged their Republican colleagues with using parliamentary tricks to unlawfully invoke the CRA. The CRA allows Congress to quickly rescind rules passed by federal agencies within a limited time frame with a simple majority vote rather than the 60 votes needed under the filibuster rule.

“Under both Republican and Democratic administrations, California was consistently granted waivers under the Clean Air Act to implement stronger standards to help ensure cleaner air for our families,” said California Sen. Adam Schiff in a statement after Trump signed the resolutions. “By eliminating the filibuster and passing these polluter resolutions, President Donald Trump, EPA Administrator Zeldin and Republicans in Congress are undermining our state’s ability to protect the health of millions of Americans.”

California’s emissions standards are critical to reducing harmful pollution and protecting public health, which is “good for our people and good for our planet,” Bonta said.

Tens of millions of Californians, or nearly 9 in 10 residents, breathe some of the most polluted air in the country, reports from the American Lung Association show. Research shows that air pollution contributes to respiratory and cardiovascular illnesses, cancer and a million premature deaths globally each year.

California’s clean-vehicle regulations were created to address these issues, Bonta said.

“The bottom line is simple,” Bonta said. “The president doesn’t have the legal authority to weaponize the CRA against California, and we won’t let him use the CRA for his political gain, not when we’re facing worsening air pollution and a climate crisis that’s already endangering our communities.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-2217801189-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-06-12 23:34:17.900575

""Then we have another bite at the apple in the House,"" Schumer noted.","Schumer said 16 GOP senators — whom he didn't name — may be open to persuasion, and he's assembled a team of eight Democrats who have ""good relationships"" with them to lobby.

""We want a critical mass of Republicans to go to [Majority Leader John] Thune and say, 'You've got to change this, because I'll lose thousands of jobs in my state,'"" he said in an interview.

Democrats are citing analyses — like this one from the firm Energy Innovation — that show IRA-linked jobs and investments flowing heavily to red states.

There are also efforts to have Democratic governors lobby GOP governors. The pitch is heavy on consumer cost arguments and the risks of ceding clean tech sectors to China, too.

The intrigue: Schumer is looking to leverage bipartisan interest in U.S. AI leadership.

""We've gone to the AI industry and said, 'You say you need more energy. Why would you cut off the quickest, cheapest way to get more energy to the grid?'""

He pointed to a recent letter from the Data Center Coalition — which includes Google, Meta, Microsoft and Amazon — to Thune arguing that tax ""certainty"" is needed.

There's also collaboration with green groups, low-carbon energy associations, and unions on lobbying efforts.

Friction point: Schumer hopes Democrats' floor strategy can produce changes before the bill gets that far.

""We are going to have a lot of amendments that are going to be very difficult for Republican senators to vote against,"" he said. ""That helps them push their leadership to do something so they can avoid the painful vote.""

""Then we have another bite at the apple in the House,"" Schumer noted.

The other side: Republicans are confident they can get the bill to President Trump's desk, even as some acknowledge it may take longer than initially expected.

What we're watching: The Senate Finance Committee, which has yet to release its version of the budget plan's tax provisions.

Its text will be the next tangible sign of whether Senate Republicans will make big changes to the House plan.

Reality check: It's tough to see how the IRA emerges from the reconciliation fight without getting significantly pared back.

The White House and many top Republicans call it a ""green new scam"" and say the law's hundreds of billions of dollars in subsidies are wasteful.",https://images.axios.com/-PO9LCn7RkJmb5zVnd6Odr2THtc=/0x0:1920x1080/1366x768/2025/06/11/1749682201615.jpg,N,,2025-06-12 23:41:45.074019

Notably, this includes the EPA power plant rule, which would require the longest-running existing coal-fired units and most heavily utilized new gas turbines to implement carbon capture and sequestration/storage (CCS) by various compliance dates in the 2030s.
Under that requirement, coal plants which plan to stay open beyond 2039 would have to reduce or capture 90% of their carbon dioxide emissions by 2032.
The EPA also proposed weakening a regulation that requires power plants to reduce emissions of mercury and other toxic (MATS) pollutants.
Opponents of the EPA power plant rule have argued that its implementation would jeopardize grid reliability and that the emission reduction technologies proposed by the Biden EPA aren’t ready for prime time.","The Environmental Protection Agency on Wednesday proposed repealing rules that limit emissions from coal- and gas-fired power plants. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said the action would remove billions of dollars in costs for industry and help unleash American energy.

Notably, this includes the EPA power plant rule, which would require the longest-running existing coal-fired units and most heavily utilized new gas turbines to implement carbon capture and sequestration/storage (CCS) by various compliance dates in the 2030s.

Under that requirement, coal plants which plan to stay open beyond 2039 would have to reduce or capture 90% of their carbon dioxide emissions by 2032. Coal plants that are scheduled to close by 2039 would have to cut their emissions 16% by 2030, while those that are set to retire by 2032 would be exempted from the new rule.

New natural gas-fired plants that run more than 40% of the time, considered “baseload” by the agency, would also have to eliminate 90% of their carbon dioxide emissions using CCS by 2032.

The EPA also proposed weakening a regulation that requires power plants to reduce emissions of mercury and other toxic (MATS) pollutants. The Trump administration has already granted exceptions to 47 companies from MATS standards. Southern Company owns the most exempted coal-fired units (14 units at five facilities), followed by NRG and TVA (each with four coal-fired facilities).

The power plant rules are among about 30 environmental regulations that Zeldin targeted in March when he announced what he called the “most consequential day of deregulation in American history.”

Zeldin said Wednesday the new rules would help end what he called the Biden and Obama administrations’ “war on so much of our U.S. domestic energy supply.”

EPA is also proposing to repeal the 2015 emissions standards for new fossil fuel-fired power plants issued during the Obama-Biden Administration. The first Clean Power Plan was never fully implemented and was struck down by the Supreme Court in 2022.

Opponents of the EPA power plant rule have argued that its implementation would jeopardize grid reliability and that the emission reduction technologies proposed by the Biden EPA aren’t ready for prime time. They praised the Trump Administration’s announcement Wednesday.

“We were on a collision course: pushing carbon reductions aggressively while dispatchable sources were being retired faster than replacements could come online,” said David Naylor, president and CEO of Rayburn Electric Cooperative in Texas. “Rules should support both transition and resilience, not force a trade-off. This policy shift helps us reset the conversation, allowing for a more practical path to emissions reduction without compromising reliability.”

Environmental and public health groups called the rollbacks dangerous and vowed to challenge the rules in court. The EPA-targeted rules could prevent an estimated 30,000 deaths and save $275 billion each year they are in effect, according to an Associated Press analysis that included the agency’s own prior assessments and a wide range of other research.

The power sector is the nation’s second-largest contributor to climate change, after transportation.

In its proposed regulation, the Trump EPA argues that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases from fossil fuel-fired power plants “do not contribute significantly to dangerous pollution” or climate change and therefore do not meet a threshold under the Clean Air Act for regulatory action. Greenhouse gas emissions from coal and gas-fired plants “are a small and decreasing part of global emissions,” the EPA said, adding: “This Administration’s priority is to promote the public health or welfare through energy dominance and independence secured by using fossil fuels to generate power.”

“It means even if some of the states are getting gains from the fossil fuel industry, it’s being offset by the losses in clean energy benefits.” The study came out as the Senate was crafting its version of Trump’s main legislative initiative—the so-called “One Big Beautiful Bill” that will extend and expand tax cuts while slashing government spending, including on incentives for clean energy.
“The level of state ambition does play a role here, and it can help counteract some of the impacts of these federal clean energy policy rollbacks,” Zhao said.
Overall, the study estimates ending the Biden-era clean energy policies will result in 22,800 premature deaths of Americans and $160 billion in lost income cumulatively over the next decade.
Average home energy costs in 2035 would be $206 higher than they would have been under climate-friendly policy, the Maryland analysts estimated.","In a week when the Trump administration moved forward on multiple fronts to repeal U.S. climate policies, a new analysis quantified the potential costs for public health, households and the economy—including a stunning $1.1 trillion reduction in U.S. gross domestic product by 2035.

The study by the University of Maryland’s Center for Global Sustainability found that any economic benefits to the policy retreat—which Environmental Protection Agency Lee Zeldin placed at $1.2 billion a year from the power plant regulatory rollback alone—would be overwhelmed by the negative effects of greater air pollution and contraction in new manufacturing and jobs associated with an energy transition.

“Overall, there are more GDP losses if we roll back clean energy policies,” said Alicia Zhao, research manager at the center and lead author of the report. “It means even if some of the states are getting gains from the fossil fuel industry, it’s being offset by the losses in clean energy benefits.”

The study came out as the Senate was crafting its version of Trump’s main legislative initiative—the so-called “One Big Beautiful Bill” that will extend and expand tax cuts while slashing government spending, including on incentives for clean energy. Although a group of Republican senators is pushing to keep some of the tax breaks for wind, solar, electric vehicles and battery technology, which overwhelmingly have benefited red states, the depth of their commitment is not clear—especially amid pressure from the president to pass the overall package before July 4.

Meanwhile, in what Zeldin described as “a historic day at the EPA” on Wednesday, he formally proposed two regulatory repeals that he promised weeks ago: the end of greenhouse gas rules and mercury and air toxics regulations for power plants. In doing so, he stressed alleged economic benefits: $19 billion over the next 20 years in reduced costs to the power plant industry related to the carbon rules, and another $1 billion from jettisoning the mercury and air toxic standard.

But even the EPA’s own figures show a cost-benefit analysis that tips dramatically against the repeals if $130 billion in increased public health costs are considered. These include premature death, heart and lung disease, asthma attacks and increased hospitalizations due to air pollutants like fine particulate matter and ozone.

When asked at a press conference how he could justify the regulatory repeals given the lopsided cost-benefit equation, Zeldin fired back: “How do you justify not doing this action?”

Not addressing the health cost issue, Zeldin asserted repeatedly that President Joe Biden administration’s intended to kill the coal and oil industries with the greenhouse gas rules “to destroy industries that didn’t align with their narrow-minded climate change zealotry.”

Zeldin expressed skepticism of past analyses that showed health benefits of power plant regulations outweighing the costs. He pointed out that when President Barack Obama’s administration originally put mercury and air toxics rules into place in 2012, it estimated the cost to industry would be $9.6 billion. But utilities estimated that they invested $18 billion to bring power plants in compliance with those standards, which the U.S. Supreme Court ultimately struck down.

“Just because they might be throwing out their numbers to justify their rules doesn’t make their numbers accurate,” Zeldin said.

Members of Congress from fossil fuel producing states like West Virginia, North Dakota and Ohio joined Zeldin to praise his repeal of the greenhouse gas and mercury rules. But according to the new University of Maryland study, those states will face some of the worst economic and public health consequences if the Trump administration succeeds in repealing climate regulations at the same time that Congress takes back the clean energy incentives that were passed in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act.

By 2035, air pollution and associated health damages would be 14 percent higher in West Virginia and 13 percent higher in North Dakota compared to what they would be under current policy, according to the center’s analysis.

Conversely, the center’s results show states that have strong policies in place to limit air pollution and to promote clean energy will be more insulated from the costs of the federal policy repeal. “The level of state ambition does play a role here, and it can help counteract some of the impacts of these federal clean energy policy rollbacks,” Zhao said. The health and economic costs for California, Washington and Oregon are low compared to those in the rest of the country. But Zhao said the team, which hopes to publish its work in a peer-reviewed journal later this year, will have to update the analysis to include recent Congressional action to wipe California’s clean car standards off the books.

Overall, the study estimates ending the Biden-era clean energy policies will result in 22,800 premature deaths of Americans and $160 billion in lost income cumulatively over the next decade. Average home energy costs in 2035 would be $206 higher than they would have been under climate-friendly policy, the Maryland analysts estimated.

The EPA analysis supporting the power plant regulatory repeal has different numbers, although they are not much better for consumers. In 2035, it estimates that retail electricity prices will be 1 percent lower than they are today. Coal production for power sector use would increase 21 percent by 2035, EPA projected. And coal production would soar 84 percent by 2045—a year when scientists say carbon emissions need to be near net zero to avoid the worst impacts of climate change.

With nearly $80 billion in investment expected to flow into the sector in the coming years, carbon capture is becoming a central part of global climate strategies. Reports say global CCS capacity might grow four times by 2030. This shows big advances in technology, funding, and teamwork across countries.

Why Is CCS Gaining So Much Attention?

Carbon capture and storage is a process that captures carbon dioxide (CO₂) from industrial and energy-related sources before it reaches the atmosphere. It then stores the carbon underground in geological formations.

CCS works well in sectors like cement, steel, and fossil fuel plants. These areas are tough to decarbonize with just renewable energy.

According to DNV’s 2025 Energy Transition Outlook: CCS to 2050 report, cumulative global investment in CCS could reach $80 billion over the next five years, or by 2030. This represents 270 million tons of carbon dioxide captured (MtCO2) each year.

A notable example is a $500 million agreement between Occidental Petroleum and the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC). They will build a big direct air capture (DAC) facility in Texas.

The deal shows the growing global interest in CCS. It’s not just about cutting emissions; it’s also about creating carbon removal solutions that support other climate efforts.

Experts agree that CCS isn’t a complete solution. However, it plays a key role by tackling emissions that other technologies can’t remove. It is also one of the few methods available today for carbon dioxide removal, a crucial component for meeting long-term climate targets.

How Fast Is CCS Capacity Growing?

The global CCS capacity is expected to grow fourfold by 2030, according to the DNV report. From around 50 million tonnes of CO₂ captured annually today, capacity could rise to more than 550 million tonnes per year by the end of the decade. This would represent around 6% of today’s energy-related global emissions.

This growth requires major investment in infrastructure, including new carbon pipelines, storage hubs, and large-scale capture facilities. North America and Europe are expected to lead the expansion. They could make up more than 80% of the expected CCS capacity by 2030. This is due to helpful climate policies, funding incentives, and established infrastructure.

In the U.S., the Inflation Reduction Act drives CCS growth. It offers tax credits up to $85 for each metric ton of CO₂ captured and stored permanently. Similarly, the European Union supports CCS through its Innovation Fund, with countries like Norway and the Netherlands building cross-border carbon storage networks in the North Sea.

Emerging markets are also entering the CCS space. In Asia, Japan and South Korea have begun planning domestic CCS facilities and exploring regional carbon storage partnerships.

Smart Tech, Lower Costs: CCS Innovation Takes Off

Technology is central to making CCS more effective and affordable. Current advancements include improved solvents for carbon capture, modular DAC units, and more efficient CO₂ transport and storage systems. These innovations help lower energy use and cut costs.

A 2023 report from the Energy Futures Initiative (EFI) says CCS costs might drop by 40% by 2050. This could happen because of better technology and larger production. New digital tools, like AI monitoring systems, are being tested. They track carbon storage performance in real time and help ensure long-term safety.

Data centers in the U.S. are beginning to integrate CCS into their sustainability efforts. For example, Microsoft is partnering with firms like Heirloom and CarbonCapture to buy permanent carbon removal credits backed by CCS. These partnerships show how CCS is moving beyond industrial use and into corporate sustainability strategies.

Hybrid projects, combining renewable energy with CCS, are also on the rise. These include bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), where biomass is used for power generation and the CO₂ is captured. This type of system can result in net-negative emissions—removing more carbon from the atmosphere than it emits.

How Do Policy and Carbon Markets Influence CCS Growth?

Strong policy support is driving CCS development. In the U.S., the Section 45Q tax credit offers financial incentives for both point-source carbon capture and DAC projects. The Department of Energy also provides funding for demonstration and early-stage CCS projects.

Globally, carbon markets are beginning to recognize the role of CCS. The voluntary carbon market (VCM) and compliance markets in California and the EU Emissions Trading System are considering or already using CCS-based credits.

In 2024, the global carbon market was valued at around $1.4 billion according to MSCI, with voluntary carbon credit transaction volumes declining but demand remaining steady. Projections suggest it could grow significantly, reaching between $7 billion and $35 billion by 2030.

Longer-term forecasts estimate the market could expand to as much as $250 billion by 2050. This is driven by increasing corporate climate commitments and demand for high-quality carbon removal credits.

High-quality carbon credits from CCS projects could play a major role in this growth. Projects that use strict measurement, reporting, and verification (MRV) protocols can attract higher prices. This applies in both voluntary and regulatory markets.

Wood Mackenzie estimates the U.S. CCUS (carbon capture, utilization, and storage) sector could offer a $196 billion investment opportunity over the next 10 years. This is especially true for the oil, gas, chemical, and power industries.

Meanwhile, countries like Canada, Australia, and the UK are developing shared CCS “hub” models—regional centers that link multiple emission sources to centralized storage facilities. These hubs lower costs and speed up development by pooling resources and infrastructure.

A Critical Piece of the Climate Puzzle

By 2030, global CCS projects could capture between 430 and 550 million tonnes of CO₂ each year. This is a big step forward, but it’s not enough. Experts say we need 1.3 billion tonnes per year by mid-century to meet the Paris Agreement goals.

Still, CCS plays a unique and necessary role in cutting emissions where alternatives are limited. The technology’s capture capacity will grow to 1,300 MtCO2/yr. It also supports the production of low-carbon hydrogen, decarbonized fuels, and sustainable building materials.

However, some environmental groups caution that CCS must be applied carefully. Using captured carbon for enhanced oil recovery (EOR) can hurt climate efforts. This happens if it isn’t combined with limits on fossil fuel use.

Clear governance, independent checks, and science-based standards are key to making sure CCS projects truly help climate goals. While it is not a silver bullet, CCS can buy time and cut emissions in sectors that are difficult to decarbonize with renewables alone.

As global capacity grows and costs drop, CCS will likely be key to climate strategies. This includes energy efficiency, clean fuels, and electrification. Continued collaboration among stakeholders, significant investment, and communities’ support will be key to making carbon capture and storage both scalable and sustainable.",https://carboncredits.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/flux_80B-Surge-in-Carbon-Capture-Investments-by-2030.jpg,N,,2025-06-12 23:41:58.260037

BARBARA SPRUNT, BYLINE: President Trump has long talked about his frustrations with clean energy provisions signed into law by President Biden in the Inflation Reduction Act. Here he is at an April rally in Michigan.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: You know what I don't give approval to? Those stupid windmills that go round and round and round.

(BOOING)

TRUMP: And we've ended the green new scam.

SPRUNT: The House passed a bill that would accomplish much of President Trump's agenda, like extending the 2017 tax cuts. To help pay for that, it takes an axe to clean energy credits. The bill would roll back incentives for wind, solar and hydrogen power, phase out consumer tax credits for new electric vehicles and terminate some credits for projects that begin construction more than 60 days after the bill's enactment. But it would also impact a lot of business happening in primarily red states.

BOB KEEFE: If you look at the total investments by business, 80% of them have gone into Republican congressional districts. So this isn't happening in California or New York. These aren't, you know, tree huggers or environmentalists getting hurt. It's workers in red states.

SPRUNT: That's Bob Keefe, Executive Director of E2, a nonpartisan pro-environment business group that's been tracking clean energy projects for over two years.

KEEFE: We've seen $14 billion worth of new factories and other projects - you know, clean energy, electric vehicle-related plants, solar projects, wind projects, battery projects - canceled in America because of the uncertainty over this bill.

SPRUNT: In April, four Republican senators sent a letter to Senate leadership saying a significant repeal of credits in place from the IRA could jeopardize job creation in the energy sector. Utah's John Curtis was one of them.

JOHN CURTIS: I think it's really important that Senate Republicans - and, I wish, House Republicans - look at this not from the standpoint of it's in the IRA, therefore it's bad, but rather, what is in the country's best interest and what is the best tax policy?

SPRUNT: He said credits should be analyzed individually to evaluate merit and that if credits are eliminated, how they go is important, both for consumers and for businesses.

CURTIS: If we're closing these down, let's just do it in a way that takes into account those employees at those businesses, the banks that loaned on those projects and make sure we have business certainty.

SPRUNT: He says his phone has been ringing off the hook with people concerned about the Senate's next steps.

CURTIS: I would say more than we can meet with.

SPRUNT: Senators aren't only hearing from lobbyists and industry leaders. They're also getting entreated by their Republican counterparts in the House.

ROB BRESNAHAN: We had some good conversations with a handful of senators.

SPRUNT: That's Congressman Rob Bresnahan of Pennsylvania, one of 13 House Republicans who are urging the Senate to substantially change the energy provisions that they voted for.

BRESNAHAN: You know, I'm OK with the phase-out but giving enough runway for projects that have already been committed and pledged to be completed before having the rug ripped out from, essentially, underneath them.

SPRUNT: Senate Finance Committee ranking member Ron Wyden, a Democrat, said he's optimistic that progress is being made among his GOP colleagues.

RON WYDEN: What I'm doing is going literally senator by senator of those who support innovation or, you know, understand that clean energy helps to create more competition and choice, which is also a kind of Republican idea.

SPRUNT: But in Congress, you make one group happy, and it crosses another group's red line. Once the Senate passes the bill, it then goes back to the House, and some members there have already said if the Senate waters down those clean energy rollbacks, they'll vote no.

The ‘Climate Cartel’ It’s unclear whether these MAGA groups – and the Trump administration – will ease up on the EU if the CSDDD is ditched entirely.","“The CSDDD is the greatest threat to America’s sovereignty since the fall of the Soviet Union,” the Heartland Institute, a pro-Trump U.S. think tank, tweeted on 31 March.

The Heartland Institute is one of the world’s leading climate science denial groups. It has helped to draft Donald Trump’s anti-climate policies, which have seen the president pledge to “drill baby drill” for more fossil fuels and once again pull the U.S. out of the flagship 2015 Paris Agreement.

Over recent months – along with a host of other Trump allies – the Heartland Institute has set its sights on a new target: the EU’s Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD).

This vague acronym belies the potentially transformative impact of the new law. In its original form, the CSDDD sought to require large companies – and those in “high risk” sectors – trading in the EU to address human rights and environmental issues in their own operations and in their supply chains. High turnover companies would also have been forced to adopt a plan to align with the Paris Agreement, including setting emissions reduction targets.

The Heartland Institute and its anti-climate, anti-regulation peers are vocal opponents of the law – and launched an aggressive campaign to water it down, or even to see it scrapped entirely.

These groups, which are all part of the ‘Make America Great Again’ (MAGA) ecosystem, view the CSDDD as symbolic of the way in which “woke” governments are attempting to force citizens and global corporations to conform to a pro-diversity, pro-environment agenda.

Following Trump’s election in November, these MAGA groups wasted no time in formulating their plans to oppose this perceived agenda.

They focused in particular on diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives, which attempt to create workplaces free from bias – and environmental, social and governance (ESG) schemes, which try to ensure that organisations are guided by responsible and sustainable practices, not just profit.

In December, barely a month after Trump’s victory, the Heritage Foundation – the group that wrote the key ‘Project 2025’ blueprint for the president’s second term – published a report entitled: “ESG, DEI, and What to Do About Them”.

In the report, the Heritage Foundation described ESG and DEI as “pernicious”, and called the CSDDD “a serious problem”.

Two months later, the State Financial Officers Foundation – an influential network of Republican finance officials – wrote an open letter calling on the new administration to “investigate” the CSDDD, claiming that the EU’s directives are based on “unscientific assumptions about the nature of climate change impacts” and “will force companies to incriminate themselves”.

This quickly filtered through to Trump’s Cabinet. On 12 February, Howard Lutnick, the president’s pick for commerce secretary, told a Senate committee that the CSDDD threatened to place “significant burdens” on U.S. companies, and that the Trump administration was exploring the use of “commercial tools” to mount a counter-attack against the EU’s environmental regulations.

Soon this rhetoric made its way to the White House. In March, as part of the worldwide tariffs implemented by the Trump administration, the president called the EU “one of the most hostile and abusive taxing and tariffing authorities in the world”.

But the EU hasn’t stood firm in the face of Trump’s war of words.

The EU has already announced that it will be scaling back the CSDDD and delaying its implementation. The number of companies within scope has been reduced by 80 percent. The firms in question will only be required to file due diligence reports every five years, and won’t be required to investigate the ESG operations of their indirect business partners. The implementation of the law has also been postponed until 2028.

But Trump’s MAGA hardliners are still not satisfied. In April, the Heartland Institute released an open letter signed by 31 other groups, calling for Congress and the Trump administration to “take immediate steps to counter the CSDDD’s implementation”, including “if necessary, imposing retaliatory trade policies that punish EU nations for eroding America’s sovereignty, freedoms, and prosperity.”

This backlash is now influencing European leaders. In late May, French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz called for the CSDDD to be scrapped entirely. They claim it must be abandoned in order to defend the “competitiveness” of European corporations, with Macron stating that Europe must “synchronise with the U.S. and the rest of the world.”

This judgement signifies the appeasement of anti-climate pressure groups that are ideologically opposed to clean energy and climate science.

The Heartland Institute has denied that humans are driving climate change, which it has called a “delusion”, while the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025 document urged Trump to “dismantle the administrative state”, reverse policies on climate action, slash restrictions on fossil fuel extraction, scrap state investment in renewable energy, and gut the Environmental Protection Agency.

If the EU waters down its climate policies in response to Trump’s pressure, it will have helped to send Project 2025 global.

The ‘Climate Cartel’

It’s unclear whether these MAGA groups – and the Trump administration – will ease up on the EU if the CSDDD is ditched entirely. They may simply use it as evidence that European lawmakers will buckle under enough pressure.

Indeed, MAGA’s opposition to the CSDDD is part of a multi-pronged campaign that seeks to dismantle global climate initiatives pioneered by both governments and corporations.

Much of the original groundwork for this campaign was undertaken by the U.S. House Judiciary Committee and its chair Jim Jordan, a leading Trump supporter.

Last year, Jordan’s committee produced reports – and demanded evidence from major corporations – on a supposed “climate cartel” of “left-wing activists and major financial institutions”.

The committee alleged that some of the world’s biggest asset managers – that have questionable climate commitments – are conspiring to force American companies to decarbonise against their wishes.

As part of its “investigation”, the committee demanded information from more than 130 U.S.-based companies, retirement and pension programmes, as well as 60 U.S.-based asset managers.

In November, 11 Republican-led states sued BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street – three of the world’s biggest asset managers – over their ESG policies. In West Virginia and Oklahoma, nearly two dozen banks have been barred from public contracts for trying to divest from fossil fuels.

These actions, along with the anti-climate rhetoric of Donald Trump, have had a chilling effect. In February last year, BlackRock, State Street, and JP Morgan Asset Management withdrew from Climate Action 100+, an investor-led initiative that works to ensure the world’s largest greenhouse gas emitters take action on climate change.

Fast forward a year, and a growing list of major U.S. corporations are either cancelling or delaying their sustainability reports – designed to show how they are meeting their climate commitments.

And a new story from the investigative outlet CORRECTIV today reports that German insurance giants and investment firms are withdrawing from climate agreements, while companies are quietly shelving their sustainability policies, amid the anti-ESG backlash orchestrated by Trump and his acolytes.

As one sustainability expert at a financial firm told CORRECTIV: “We have to be careful not to harm the cause by sticking our necks out and becoming a target in the U.S.”

The state quickly announced it was challenging the move in court, with California’s attorney general holding a news conference to discuss the lawsuit before Trump’s signing ceremony ended at the White House.

The resolution was approved by Congress last month and aims to quash the country’s most aggressive attempt to phase out gas-powered cars. Trump also signed measures to overturn state policies curbing tailpipe emissions in certain vehicles and smog-forming nitrogen oxide pollution from trucks.

Trump called California’s regulations “crazy” at a White House ceremony where he signed the resolutions.

“It’s been a disaster for this country,” he said.

It comes as the Republican president is mired in a clash with California’s Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom, over Trump’s move to deploy troops to Los Angeles in response to immigration protests. It’s the latest in an ongoing battle between the Trump administration and heavily Democratic California over issues including tariffs, the rights of LGBTQ+ youth and funding for electric vehicle chargers.

The state is already involved in more than two-dozen lawsuits challenging Trump administration actions, and the state’s Democratic Attorney General Rob Bonta announced the latest one at a news conference in California. Ten other states, all with Democratic attorneys general, joined the lawsuit filed Thursday.

“The federal government’s actions are not only unlawful; they’re irrational and wildly partisan,” Bonta said. “They come at the direct expense of the health and the well-being of our people.”

The three resolutions Trump signed will block California’s rule phasing out gas-powered cars and end the sale of new ones by 2035. They will also kill rules that phase out the sale of medium- and heavy-duty diesel vehicles and cut tailpipe emissions from trucks.

In his remarks at the White House, Trump expressed doubts about the performance and reliability of electric vehicles, though he had some notably positive comments about the company owned by Elon Musk, despite their fractured relationship.

“I like Tesla,” Trump said.

In remarks that often meandered away from the subject at hand, Trump used the East Room ceremony to also muse on windmills, which he claimed “are killing our country,” the prospect of getting electrocuted by an electric-powered boat if it sank and whether he’d risk a shark attack by jumping as the boat went down.

“I’ll take electrocution every single day,” the president said.

When it comes to cars, Trump said he likes combustion engines but for those that prefer otherwise, “If you want to buy electric, you can buy electric.”

“What this does is it gives us freedom,” said Bill Kent, the owner of Kent Kwik convenience stores. Kent, speaking at the White House, said that the California rules would have forced him to install “infrastructure that frankly, is extremely expensive and doesn’t give you any return.”

The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, which represents major car makers, applauded Trump’s action.

“Everyone agreed these EV sales mandates were never achievable and wildly unrealistic,” John Bozzella, the group’s president and CEO, said in a statement.

Newsom, who is considered a likely 2028 Democratic presidential candidate, and California officials contend that what the federal government is doing is illegal and said the state plans to sue.

Newsom said Trump’s action was a continuation of his “all-out assault” on California.

“And this time he’s destroying our clean air and America’s global competitiveness in the process,” Newsom said in a statement. “We are suing to stop this latest illegal action by a President who is a wholly-owned subsidiary of big polluters.”

Newsom later Thursday doubled down on his state’s assertion of its right to set environmental regulations. He signed an executive order requiring state air regulators to propose new rules further limiting air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions from cars and trucks if a court ultimately upholds California’s rules that Trump sought to kill.

Trump’s signing of the resolutions comes as he has pledged to revive American auto manufacturing and boost oil and gas drilling.

The move follows other steps the Trump administration has taken to roll back rules that aim to protect air and water and reduce emissions that cause climate change.

The Environmental Protection Agency on Wednesday proposed repealing rules that limit greenhouse gas emissions from power plants fueled by coal and natural gas.

Dan Becker with the Center for Biological Diversity, said the signing of the resolutions was “Trump’s latest betrayal of democracy.”

“Signing this bill is a flagrant abuse of the law to reward Big Oil and Big Auto corporations at the expense of everyday people’s health and their wallets,” Becker said in a statement.

California, which has some of the nation’s worst air pollution, has been able to seek waivers for decades from the EPA, allowing it to adopt stricter emissions standards than the federal government.

In his first term, Trump revoked California’s ability to enforce its standards, but Democratic President Joe Biden reinstated it in 2022. Trump has not yet sought to revoke it again.

Republicans have long criticized those waivers and earlier this year opted to use the Congressional Review Act, a law aimed at improving congressional oversight of actions by federal agencies, to try to block the rules.

That’s despite a finding from the U.S. Government Accountability Office, a nonpartisan congressional watchdog, that California’s standards cannot legally be blocked using the Congressional Review Act. The Senate parliamentarian agreed with that finding.

California, which makes up roughly 11% of the U.S. car market, has significant power to sway trends in the auto industry. About a dozen states signed on to adopt California’s rule phasing out the sale of new gas-powered cars.

In contrast, repealing clean energy investments would cause the following harms:

Electricity bills for households would increase by $110 in 2026 and go up 10 percent for businesses.

Investors could pull back more than $500 billion of unspent investment in U.S. manufacturing.

840,000 jobs for Americans would be at risk from downsized investments and canceled projects across the country.

Grid reliability and energy supply could face new challenges, as data centers are estimated to account for almost half of electricity demand growth by 2030 and new energy supply is lagging.

The future capacity of the U.S. power grid is at stake

ClimateDeck data from the Rhodium Group shows that in the decade before the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) was enacted, an average of only 15 GW of solar, wind, and batteries were added to the grid each year. By comparison, natural gas added 4 GW per year in the same period, and all other sources of electricity either shrank or remained relatively constant.2

Then, in 2024, powered by the clean energy investment incentives of the IRA, the combined deployment of solar, wind, and batteries tripled, with 45 GW of clean energy added to the grid last year. The explosion in clean energy investment is set to add 58 more GW to the grid this year. In the coming decade, CAP’s analysis found, deployment of these key technologies is projected to surge to an average rate of almost 100 GW per year, or even up to 170 GW per year in 2035.3 This construction boom integrated strong labor standards incentivized by the IRA, and is on track to build a grid that would supply up to 88 percent of its electricity without any fossil fuel costs by 20354—cutting pollution and alleviating electricity prices even as the grid grows to supply the increasing power demands of the modern economy.

Yet the Senate is considering legislation that would hinder this progress. Under the House-passed reconciliation bill, which terminates federal clean energy investment, additions to the electricity grid would crater. Energy Innovation’s recent analysis of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act finds that it would cause new electricity additions to fall to roughly 33 GW per year by 2035, or 330 GW total. Similar ranges in energy capacity loss are reflected in the Rhodium Group’s multi-scenario analysis on clean energy tax credit repeal, which shows that the average annual deployment of solar, wind, and storage would likely fall down to 34 GW or even to as little as 13 GW under certain conditions.5 As much as 72 percent of all clean energy capacity that would have been built over the next decade would disappear.

As much as 72 percent of all clean energy capacity that would have been built over the next decade would disappear. Rhodium Group, ""Ways and Means Brings the Hammer Down on Energy Credits"" (2025).

Nuclear power, which added 1.1 GW of new capacity last year after the decades-long process to build the Vogtle power plant, may, if not affected by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, add another 4 GW of new capacity over the coming decade due to the federal incentives for new emissions-free power.6 This technology-neutral approach to supporting clean energy has also justified private investment in research to develop fusion power, enhanced geothermal, and other innovations. Without the federal incentives, no new nuclear power is projected to be built in the coming decade.

The loss of new clean electricity capacity will not be fully replaced by new gas or other energy sources. Gas developers are facing growing costs and long wait times for projects to come online, with many not slated to deliver power until 2030 or later, as it takes seven years, on average, to build a new natural gas power plant. Time delays in equipment procurement caused the withdrawal of a large gas project in Texas earlier this year. Without federal clean energy incentives, economic projections indicate that annual new baseload natural gas capacity additions could increase by as little as 0.8 GW per year in response to the lost solar, wind, and battery storage—and without federal incentives, little or none of that new natural gas capacity would bother to capture and sequester carbon.7 In the best-case scenario for natural gas, under which data center growth for artificial intelligence is most rapid and clean energy investment is repealed, an average of 10 GW of new baseload natural gas capacity would be added annually.8 In place of the new clean affordable electricity that would have been built, new and existing power plants would be called on to generate more power, unnecessarily consuming expensive and polluting fuel.

Taken together, more than half of all new capacity added to the grid over the next 10 years will be lost if federal clean energy investment is terminated.

The House Republican plan has consequences for the power grid and cost of living

The proposed cuts to the federal clean energy incentives would not only limit new clean energy additions to the grid but would have cascading effects throughout American society.

Increase electricity bills for households by $110 per year

Gutting clean energy investment at the federal level would hand Americans even higher electricity bills, raising prices by 7 percent for households and by 10 percent for businesses next year. If energy tax incentives are repealed, U.S. households would bear an average increase of $110 in electricity costs in 2026. In the next decade, Energy Innovation projects an average $260 increase in Americans’ energy bills every year, but by 2035, some states, such as South Carolina and Kentucky, could see even higher average annual increases of more than $800. The nation’s commercial and industrial sectors would also be hit by repeal and see double-digit percentage increases in electricity prices in nearly half of U.S. states in 2026. With 4 out of every 5 Americans feeling “powerless” about their skyrocketing energy bills, removing federal clean investment would only leave more households in financial distress.

The House Republican Plan To Increase Gas and Electricity Prices

Trevor Higgins

Risk more than $500 billion of unspent investment in the U.S. manufacturing industry

In addition to raising electric rates for manufacturers, House Republicans’ proposed legislation would suddenly pull the rug out from under billions of dollars of transformational investments. As of early May 2025, a more than $500 billion investment in manufacturing and clean energy deployment had been announced but not yet spent; gutting the federal incentives that form the basis of project financing would put these investments at risk. These cuts would forfeit the United States’ competitive edge in the clean energy industry and auto supply chain created by the IRA—leaving ample opportunity for other nations, such as China, to out-produce and out-innovate the United States.

Create difficulties for grid support of data centers

Data centers, driven by purported artificial intelligence services, could account for almost half of the United States’ electricity demand growth by 2030. If power-hungry AI data centers are built and clean energy is not, Americans will bear the costs of higher rates and utility bills. Repealing energy tax credits could cause the nation to struggle with transforming its data centers from grid burdens to grid assets as well as risk the competitiveness of its digital infrastructure.

Cut 840,000 jobs for Americans

Repealing clean energy investments would undercut thousands of clean energy projects and lead to 840,000 lost jobs by the end of the decade and 790,000 lost jobs in 2035. These losses would be largely due to faltering domestic investment in clean energy, shuttered manufacturing facilities, and canceled construction projects, leading to a cumulative $1.1 trillion loss in gross domestic product (GDP) within the reconciliation budget window of 2025 to 2034.

Conclusion

House Republicans’ One Big Beautiful Bill Act would reduce the capacity of America’s power system, threatening cost of living, jobs, competitiveness, and the climate.

The president also threatened to raise automotive tariffs in the near future as a way to increase domestic auto manufacturing.

On Thursday, President Trump signed joint resolutions of Congress that block California's attempt to ban the sale of purely gas-powered cars in its state. Allowed to stand, the California rule would have required that electric cars make up progressively larger shares of new car sales each year—until 2035, at which point the sale of new internal-combustion cars would be banned—though, under CAFE, plug-in hybrids would continue to be allowed.

By signing the joint resolutions of Congress, which were passed by a Republican majority in May, Trump reversed the Biden administration's previous approval of the California law. According to a report by , Trump, speaking at the signing event, called the plan a ""disaster"" and said it would ""effectively abolish the internal combustion engine, which most people prefer."" The resolutions also revoke two other California clean-air policies—one requiring half of all new trucks sold in the state to be electric by 2035 and the other limiting the amount of nitrogen oxide cars and trucks emit.

In addition to signing the joint resolutions, the president also threatened to increase U.S. automotive tariffs from their current 25 percent. The president said raising auto tariffs from their current level could provide more protection for the domestic auto industry.

""I might go up with that tariff in the not too distant future,"" Trump said. ""The higher you go, the more likely it is they build a plant here."" The latest threat comes roughly a week after the president increased tariffs on foreign aluminum and steel to 50 percent, further increasing pressure on automakers.","https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/an-electric-vehicle-fast-charger-stands-at-a-rest-stop-news-photo-1749761196.pjpeg?crop=0.755xw:0.566xh;0,0.434xh&resize=1200:*",N,,2025-06-12 23:34:29.042191

The website will stop publishing new content on July 1.

The site, climate.gov, is operated by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). As of 2021, it received nearly one million visitors every month, and was one of the most trusted sources of climate-related information in the U.S., according to public surveys about the site.

A staff of 10 people wrote content and created maps, charts and explanatory graphics for climate.gov. Those employees have now been terminated, according to Rebecca Lindsey, the former program manager for the website. NOAA did not respond to questions from NPR about changes to the site.

Lindsey had worked on climate.gov for 13 years, and had recently changed roles before she was laid off in February as part of a government-wide purge of what the government calls probationary employees, generally people who were new to their specific jobs.

Two other probationary climate.gov employees were also let go at that time, and the remaining seven staff were let go in recent weeks, according to an official who is familiar with the website's operations, and who requested anonymity because they fear they will be fired for speaking about efforts to hobble the website.

All of those laid off were experienced science communication and data visualization experts who cannot be easily replaced with other NOAA employees, according to the official.

Until recently, the website published multiple items each week that were tailored to what was happening in the U.S. For example, in the last month, the site published up-to-date information about tornado season and wildfire smoke. The site also publishes original maps, charts and other data to explain drought trends, changes to rain and snowfall and seasonal climate outlooks for the U.S., to help people across the country plan for heat waves, floods and other extreme weather.

Lindsey says it's clear to her that the administration is trying to get rid of public conversation about climate change and its profound impacts on people in the U.S. ""They think that climate change isn't real, and they don't want anybody talking about it,"" she says.

The White House did not respond to questions about why the climate.gov website has been hobbled, or what might happen to the site in the future. The site has not been fully shuttered — all the content that has been published in the past is still available as of now, although much of it will rapidly become obsolete if it is not updated.

The Trump administration has gutted other climate-related programs across the federal government. Earlier this year, all of the staff in charge of the National Climate Assessment were laid off. Like climate.gov, the assessment is designed to provide accurate, useful climate information to the public and to local officials who rely on it to make decisions about roads, housing and infrastructure for electricity, drinking water and sewers.

The law, which both chambers of Congress passed last month, applies to 17 states that follow California standards.","President Donald Trump signed a Congressional Review Act resolution Thursday that revokes California’s authority to set tailpipe emissions standards, upending policy in California and 17 other states that tie their standards to that of the Golden State.

California Attorney General Rob Bonta and Democratic attorneys general in 10 other states immediately sued to block enforcement of the law. Through a process that allows Congress to undo recent executive branch rules, the law repeals a U.S. Environmental Protection Act waiver allowing California to set a schedule for emissions standards for cars and trucks.

Trump signed two other resolutions that repeal the state’s authority to ban sales of new gas-powered vehicles in the state by 2035 and to regulate emissions on heavy trucks.

At a White House signing ceremony, Trump said the law would allow greater consumer choice and lead to less expensive vehicles.

“Your cars are going to cost you $3,000, $4,000 less and you're going to have what you want,” he said. “Again, you can get any car you want.”

Simple majority vote

The procedure used to pass the law was controversial because of the use of the Congressional Review Act, or CRA, which allows a simple majority vote in the U.S. Senate instead of the chamber’s usual 60-vote threshold.

Both the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office and the Senate parliamentarian ruled that the EPA waiver was not a rule and that the CRA could not be used. But Senate Majority Leader John Thune used the procedure anyway, and the measure passed 51-46.

The states suing over the law argued that process was illegal, saying that the CRA was “deemed inapplicable by every nonpartisan arbiter and expert who analyzed the question.”

“While all fifty States consented—through their Senators—to these expedited procedures for congressional disapproval of federal rules, no State consented to the CRA as a means for Congress to negate state rules,” the Democratic attorneys general wrote. “Nor would any State have done so.”

The states joining California in the lawsuit are Colorado, Delaware, Massachusetts, Oregon, Rhode Island, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Vermont and Washington.

Clean Air Act

The federal Clean Air Act of 1970 generally prohibits states from setting their own air quality standards. But a section of the bedrock environmental law allows California, which had stringent environmental standards at the time the federal law was passed, to set its own standards.

While the other 49 states may not set their own standards, any state can adopt California’s standards as its own.

That means the law Trump signed Thursday has effects far beyond California’s borders, which the president noted.

“The federal government gave left-wing radicals in California dictatorial powers to control the future of the entire car industry, all over the country, all over the world, actually,” he said.

The law, which both chambers of Congress passed last month, applies to 17 states that follow California standards.

The EPA claims the repeal would save the power sector $1.2 billion annually, improve electric reliability, and promote American energy independence.
The repeal includes undoing the Biden Administration’s 2024 Clean Air Act rule, which aimed to cut carbon emissions by relying on emerging technologies like carbon capture and sequestration.
The NRDC argues that repealing the GHG standards would increase carbon emissions from the nation’s largest industrial polluters — power plants — worsening extreme weather and respiratory illnesses.
“These rules force power plants into premature retirement and handcuff how often new natural gas plants can run,” Matheson said.","In a move with significant implications for U.S. climate policy and energy infrastructure, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) on June 11 proposed repealing two major environmental regulations from the Biden-Harris Administration. These include greenhouse gas (GHG) standards for power plants under the Clean Air Act and certain amendments to the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS). The EPA claims the repeal would save the power sector $1.2 billion annually, improve electric reliability, and promote American energy independence. But the proposals have triggered strong reactions from both environmental advocates and power sector stakeholders.

The EPA's Case for Repeal

Announced by EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin during a press conference with several Republican lawmakers and Navajo Nation President Buu Nygren, the proposed rules target what the agency calls “burdensome” regulations that disproportionately affect coal-, oil-, and gas-fired plants.

“Affordable, reliable electricity is key to the American dream,” said Zeldin, criticizing the previous regulations as part of a “narrow-minded climate change zealotry.”

EPA argues that the repealed rules — originally designed to limit carbon and toxic air emissions — would have led to premature plant closures, increased energy prices, and greater dependency on foreign energy sources. The agency is also challenging the legal foundation for regulating GHG emissions from fossil fuel plants, arguing they do not significantly contribute to dangerous air pollution under the Clean Air Act.

The repeal includes undoing the Biden Administration’s 2024 Clean Air Act rule, which aimed to cut carbon emissions by relying on emerging technologies like carbon capture and sequestration. Similarly, the rollback of the 2024 MATS amendments would reinstate the 2012 standards, which the EPA says already led to significant emissions reductions.

NRDC’s Perspective:

Environmental advocates, led by the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), criticized the move. President and CEO of NRDC Manish Bapna warned of severe consequences for public health and the climate.

“The EPA is hoisting the white flag of surrender on the power plant pollution that's poisoning the air we breathe and harming our climate,” Bapna said.

The NRDC argues that repealing the GHG standards would increase carbon emissions from the nation’s largest industrial polluters — power plants — worsening extreme weather and respiratory illnesses. The group also contends that undoing stricter mercury and air toxics standards would expose communities to increased levels of neurotoxic pollutants like mercury and arsenic.

Environmental lawyers are expected to challenge the proposals in court, citing what they view as violations of the EPA’s statutory obligations and recent legal precedents.

NRECA’s View:

In contrast, the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association (NRECA), representing utility co-ops across the country, applauded the EPA’s move. CEO Jim Matheson framed the Biden-era regulations as unworkable and legally questionable.

“These rules force power plants into premature retirement and handcuff how often new natural gas plants can run,” Matheson said. “They are textbook examples of bad energy policy.”

NRECA maintains that many of the technologies mandated by the Biden rules — especially carbon capture — are not yet viable at scale. The group also argues that compliance would drive up electricity costs and reduce reliability, particularly in rural and lower-income regions dependent on legacy coal and gas infrastructure.

By repealing these rules, Matheson says the EPA is “correcting course” and aligning policy with practical, cost-effective approaches to meeting growing energy demand.

Legal and Policy Implications

The proposals revisit long-standing debates over the role of the Clean Air Act in regulating climate change and whether EPA has the authority to set wide-ranging rules that shift the U.S. energy mix.

The Biden Administration's rules had been crafted in part as a response to the 2022 Supreme Court decision in West Virginia v. EPA, which limited the agency’s ability to implement broad carbon regulations without explicit Congressional approval.

Now, by seeking to repeal those efforts, the EPA is not just walking back recent policy — but potentially redefining the agency’s future role in addressing climate change through power sector regulation.

What Comes Next

The EPA has opened a public comment period for both proposals. If finalized, the repeals would begin impacting power plant planning and emissions strategy as early as 2026.","https://img.tdworld.com/files/base/ebm/tdworld/image/2025/06/684b43b4458e5cc249462b17-dreamstime_xxl_33149488.png?auto=format,compress&fit=fill&fill=blur&w=1200&h=630",N,,2025-06-12 23:33:19.138537

“That is a projection — we don’t know what’s going to happen next year,” Wright told Bloomberg in an interview. “We have seen weak prices for a few months, and if prices are too low for an economic incentive, you’ll see some drilling reduce on the margin. I think it’s unlikely you’ll see enough reduction to actually see a decline in production next year.”

The Energy Information Administration said earlier this week it expected oil production in the U.S. to decline from 13.5 million barrels daily in the second quarter of this year to 13.3 million barrels daily in 2026 as shale oil peaks. The authority cited weak oil prices as one reason for the expected decline, while some industry executives have pointed to the exhaustion of low-cost shale deposits as a driver of the potential future decline.

Bloomberg noted in its report that shale drillers have been laying off workers and cutting the number of drilling rigs in the patch but Wright said that “This administration is making it lower cost for them to drill wells and therefore a lower threshold at which they would start to pull back activity.”

The most vulnerable players in the shale patch are smaller independents. Supermajors such as Exxon, Chevron, and ConocoPhillips are in a business-as-usual mode, yet some of them have already said that the peak in U.S. oil production is being accelerated and could come sooner than previously expected.

“As you know that most of the shale basins now have either plateaued or are starting to decline, except for the Permian,” Occidental’s Vicki Hollub said on the company’s Q1 call.

Conoco’s Ryan Lance, for his part, said that at $60 per barrel, “the folks that don't have the kind of cost of supply sitting in their portfolio are going to find themselves cash-strapped and returns-strapped.”

As of 2021, 79 megawatts of community solar capacity had been installed; as of May, that number is up to 1,008 MW.
“Community solar is incredibly important to Maine,” said Kate Daniel, Northeast regional director for the Coalition for Community Solar Access, a national trade group.
Community solar operators would be required to rightsize customers’ subscriptions, preventing them from paying for more credits than they can use.
For opponents, however, the community solar fees are an intractable problem that outweighs any other provisions.","A legislative proposal in Maine that would impose new fees on community solar projects is having a chilling effect on solar developers, some of whom say they may stop working in the state, or even already have.

“The problem is that they’re looking to change the rules of the market after the fact,” said Brendan Bell, chief operating officer of Aligned Climate Capital, which owns several community solar projects in the state. ​“We’ve already stopped investing in Maine because of this. Simply the risk of this happening has made us stop.”

The legislation, which was approved in late May by the Energy, Utilities, and Technology Committee, aims to reform Maine’s net energy billing program — often called net metering in other states — which pays the owners of solar panels for the excess energy they share with the grid.

Nationally, net metering programs have been contentious, with states like California, New Hampshire, and North Carolina making big changes to mixed — and sometimes litigious — receptions. Maine’s system has been under scrutiny for years, as many critics say it has created excessive profits for developers while unfairly shifting costs to consumers who don’t even use solar power.

While many renewable energy advocates and developers agree that the program needs some reform, they say the current bill goes too far. The legislation outlines a new system for compensating commercial and industrial customers who own solar panels. Currently, the compensation rate is based on standard utility electricity rates, meaning solar owners make more revenue when power prices rise. The bill would require a new mechanism of gradual, annual rate increases to avoid excessive windfalls for solar owners when energy costs go up.

Of particular concern, however, are other provisions that apply to community solar developments, larger-scale installations that sell power to multiple subscribers.

In 2019, reforms to Maine’s net energy billing program paved the way for community solar to take off in the state. As of 2021, 79 megawatts of community solar capacity had been installed; as of May, that number is up to 1,008 MW.

“Community solar is incredibly important to Maine,” said Kate Daniel, Northeast regional director for the Coalition for Community Solar Access, a national trade group. ​“It’s been the driver of the new clean energy that’s gone onto the grid in recent years.”

The bipartisan legislation now under consideration would impose a monthly fee, paid by community solar owners to utilities. The money would be intended to cover the cost of delivering the solar power to consumers. Those ​“distribution costs” would otherwise be borne by utility customers.

Projects between 1 MW and 3 MW in size would pay $2.80 per kilowatt of capacity — so $5,600 a month for a 2-MW project, for example. Larger arrays between 3 MW and 5 MW would pay $6 per kilowatt — so, $24,000 per month for a 4-MW installation. These rates would be increased as needed to keep up with the cost of maintaining and expanding the grid. The goal, proponents say, is to continue supporting solar in a way that does not add to residents’ financial hardships.

“It is really important to me that we are fighting climate change in an economically just way,” said Rep. Sophie Warren, a Democrat and one of the bill’s sponsors.

However, renewable energy advocates and solar developers say the monthly fees could scare away new projects as well as put existing operations at risk.

“It basically … will consume all of our free cash flow and put us in a position where we may default on our loans,” said Cliff Chapman, CEO of Syncarpha Capital, a New York-based clean energy investment firm with eight community solar projects operating in Maine.

Opponents question the way these fees came to be included in the bill. They were not in the original draft legislation, but the idea was raised and voted on during committee debate. The language is in the process of being officially added to the bill so that lawmakers can report it out of committee and send it to the House floor. It is concerning that the fees received no public hearing, and many stakeholders and lawmakers are not even aware they are being added in, said Eliza Donoghue, executive director of the industry group Maine Renewable Energy Association.

Even if this bill fails to pass, the damage may already be done: Investors in all sorts of clean energy segments are becoming wary of doing business in a state that would even consider retroactively changing the rules for projects that were designed and financed under a different set of expectations, opponents said.

“It’s a retroactive policy proposal that many folks strongly believe would cause significant financial harm to the solar industry in Maine,” said Lindsay Bourgoine, director of policy and government affairs for Maine-based solar company ReVision Energy.

Opponents also worry that the bill sends the inaccurate message that increasing solar adoption makes energy more expensive, when research suggests the reverse is true. In 2024, solar development in Maine yielded about $1.42 in benefits for every dollar of cost, according to a report by state utilities regulators. As of the second half of 2024, net energy billing added about $7 per month to the average residential electric bill in the state.

Warren, however, says reining in even this modest increase could help some of her constituents.

“I know there are people on reverse mortgages, on fixed incomes, who are rationing their medicines,” she said. ​“These [compensation] rates are far too high, and unnecessarily high for what we’re getting from them.”

Bill proponents are also not convinced by claims that the new rules would cause financial problems for developers. The provisions are designed to have less financial impact on smaller companies that are less able to take the hit, said Maine Public Advocate Heather Sanborn, a supporter of the bill.

The bill also contains important consumer protections that opponents aren’t talking about, Sanborn said. Community solar operators would be required to rightsize customers’ subscriptions, preventing them from paying for more credits than they can use. Should a customer still end up with more credits than they need, the operator would be required to issue a refund. The legislation would also encourage the installation of battery storage in conjunction with solar.

“It is a responsible and balanced solution,” Sanborn said.

For opponents, however, the community solar fees are an intractable problem that outweighs any other provisions.

“What we don’t do in America is change rules retroactively and blow up existing investment,” Chapman said. ​“Being a state that does something like this has huge implications — they’re making themselves a pariah for investors.”",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/GettyImages-1240424915.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=ec2c4f9042a2951af6a9d09ecac40dcf,N,,2025-06-12 23:32:08.558235

The policy brief highlighting these technologies can be found here.

Carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies have been successfully demonstrated and commercially deployed in the United States over the last five decades. In recent years, there has been a surge in carbon capture project announcements thanks to bipartisan federal policy enacted in the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) and enhancements to the 45Q tax credit, all underpinned by 15 years of bipartisan support.

Today, there are more than 270 publicly announced carbon capture projects across the United States, representing a total of $77.5 billion in capital investment. Increasingly, state policymakers, too, are recognizing CCS technologies as an essential solution that supports American global competitiveness, domestic energy production, pollution reduction, and job creation. What’s more, in April this year, the Trump administration also reaffirmed its support for CCS.

Despite this apparent consensus, the U.S. House of Representatives recently passed legislation that poses a risk to U.S. leadership in carbon management technologies which threatens industrial innovation and clean firm power generation. Included in the bill are provisions that would hinder the deployment of CCS technologies by cutting important pathways to project financing. Concerningly, the Department of Energy (DOE) has also recently announced the cancellation of a total of 10 carbon capture and utilization projects from the Carbon Capture Demonstration Projects Program, the Carbon Capture Large-Scale Pilot Program, and the Industrial Demonstration Program. These cuts halt important and innovative projects at gas and coal power plants, cement facilities, and other industrial sites nationwide.

According to DOE, every dollar of federal support for carbon management projects can generate up to four dollars in economic activity through equipment orders, construction, job creation, and regional supply chain growth. Recent DOE cancellations of key demonstration and pilot projects now threaten to halt that momentum. More concerningly, DOE is also proposing over $7 billion in cuts to CCUS pilot and demonstrations in the Presidential Budget Request of 2026, as highlighted in the table below.

Table 1. Unallocated IIJA funds intended as presented in the Presidential Budget Request pf 2026.

To counter this regressive action, drive industrial innovation, and remain a global energy leader, the Senate must both protect and enhance federal carbon management policies. As global markets demand cleaner goods, CCS is a necessity for U.S competitiveness.

Protecting and enhancing 45Q tax credits is essential for U.S. leadership in carbon capture and storage.

Congress must prepare 45Q for next-generation deployment by increasing the incentive to $120/ton. While the current 45Q credit – up to $85/ton for saline sequestration – is competitive for sectors like ethanol and natural gas processing, it falls short for higher-cost applications, particularly due to inflation in recent years. According to the Carbon Capture Coalition’s analysis, cement, steel, refining, and some power projects often face abatement costs well over $100/ton. To drive widespread deployment across hard-to-abate industries, the 45Q credit needs to rise to $120/ton or more. Readjusting the credit value to account for inflation that has occurred so far this decade would also help, as current credit values won’t start adjusting for inflation until 2027. This would help close the cost gap and send a strong market signal to domestic manufacturers and their international customers.

Figure 1: Current 45Q credit levels across most sectors are falling short of covering NOAK costs

Congress must halt the erasure of early-stage demonstration projects during the appropriations process. Congress should ensure that funding for demonstrations and pilots across industrial sectors, including refining, steel, cement, chemicals, and fossil power generation, is made available by this administration. DOE has already pulled the rug out from the U.S. cement industry with its recent cuts to pilot and demonstration projects, which were authorized by the legislative branch with bipartisan support. While DOE cut 10 CCS pilot and demonstrations in May, China announced seven major industrial and power CCUS project just weeks before. However, Congress can act to reverse this. There are still unallocated funds in the programs authorized by the bipartisan IIJA, approximately 1.35 billion for Carbon Capture Demonstrations and a further 728 million for large-scale carbon capture pilots.

DOE justified cancelling several carbon-capture demonstration projects by claiming they were “not economically viable and would not generate a positive return on investment for taxpayers.” But pilot and demonstration programs exist precisely to support promising technologies that are not yet commercially viable or fully scaled; they aim to de-risk innovation, attract private capital, and drive down costs over time. Applying a strict near-term profitability test to decide which projects survive amounts to DOE picking winners rather than creating a level playing field. The results bear this out: DOE terminated both cement-sector CCUS projects—even though cement capture typically costs less per ton than coal power capture—while allowing one coal-power CCS project to proceed.

If DOE’s real concern is that the canceled projects do not align with the administration’s broader power or policy goals, then Congress should direct the department to issue a new funding opportunity specifically tailored to carbon-capture projects that advance those objectives while still honoring the programs’ original congressional mandate. Maintaining targeted pilot and demonstration funding would stabilize investor expectations in U.S carbon management policy, accelerate first-of-a-kind CCUS deployments at home

while helping American companies secure the first-mover advantage by commercializing —and ultimately exporting—the next generation of CCUS technologies.

Table 2: Canceled carbon capture projects announced May 30, 2025

Congress must protect the transferability provision within the 45Q tax credit to enable project financing. Transferability allows project developers to sell 45Q credits to investors, unlocking upfront capital and enabling participation from startups and smaller firms that do not have sufficient tax liabilities to fully leverage the credits. Removing this provision would add costs to project financing for no public benefit. As shown below in Figure 2, in 2024, the elimination of transferability would increase costs from about 5 cents per dollar to 30 cents by forcing developers to utilize tax equity markets directly. Transferability has proven its value to project developers, large and small, as an efficiency mechanism allowing developers to avoid costly and inefficient tax equity markets. Without the ability to use these transferability provisions, carbon management project development and deployment will slow significantly, leading to many projects, particularly smaller ones, failing to reach a final investment decision.

The administration must finalize and implement key safety and permitting rules, including updated PHMSA regulations for CO₂ pipeline transport. Regulatory clarity is critical to accelerating infrastructure buildout and overcoming permitting delays. Some states, like California, have introduced moratoria on pipeline development in anticipation of PHMSA’s updated rules. Further delays in implementing updated PHMSA rules will pose serious risks to project development in those states.

Congress must safeguard regulatory frameworks like the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP), which the EPA is threatening to eliminate, to ensure robust monitoring, reporting, and verification of captured CO₂, not to mention serving as a critical resource for emissions data across multiple industries. This is essential for maintaining accountability, enabling the use of 45Q tax credits, and protecting public investment. In fact, today, it is impossible to claim the 45Q credit and comply with IRS regulations without reporting under the GHGRP.

Congress must continue to hold hyperscale data center developers accountable for the power infrastructure they require. Leading U.S. technology companies—Microsoft, Google, and Amazon—have made high-profile commitments to decarbonize their electricity consumption. Microsoft has pledged to match 100% of its electricity use with zero-carbon energy by 2030. Google aims to power all data centers with carbon-free energy 24/7 by 2030 and reach net-zero emissions by the same year. Amazon claims it already matches 100% of its operations with renewable energy as of 2023 and is targeting net-zero carbon by 2040. However, the details behind these commitments often remain vague. While these companies are rapidly expanding their capacity to meet rising AI-related power demand—an effort increasingly framed as essential to national competitiveness with China—Congress must ensure that the energy infrastructure built to support this growth genuinely advances U.S. energy security goals.

While the Department of Energy cuts demonstration projects, Congress must extend support for critical carbon management infrastructure and leverage what has already been built. Pairing already funded CarbonSAFE sites with data powered by newly built natural gas turbines with carbon capture is one example. Efficient permitting of carbon dioxide pipelines is also key. This could include Congress introducing a federal siting pathway for interstate pipelines to align with the federal authority granted to natural gas pipelines under the Natural Gas Act, or state-level reforms. This would address siting challenges that currently delay projects and help translate federal investments into steel in the ground.

EPA must be equipped to handle primacy and Class VI well applications. Advancing CCS will also require a clear-eyed focus on permitting efficiency. A critical area of progress has been state primacy over Class VI wells, which govern the long-term geologic storage of CO₂. Several states—West Virginia, Texas, and Arizona—have recently advanced their primacy applications. West Virginia received final approval in early 2025 and now has full permitting authority. Texas finalized its Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) with EPA in April, and this month, EPA announced its proposal to approve Texas’s application. Arizona’s application is currently under public comment following EPA’s proposed rule in May. Louisiana, which was granted primacy in 2023, recently secured a legal victory in the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which dismissed a lawsuit challenging EPA’s decision.

Table 3: Status of Class VI Primacy

As more states pursue primacy, Congress must ensure that EPA is properly staffed and resourced to handle both the growing volume of primacy applications and the surge in Class VI well permit applications from states without primacy. The administration is proposing sweeping cuts to the EPA, posing a serious risk to EPA’s institutional capacity. Congress must ensure the Underground Injection Control (UIC) program, which governs the safe permitting and operation of Class VI wells for CO₂ storage, remains intact.",https://cdn.catf.us/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/12150215/OilIndustry_LargeBG_1.jpg,N,,2025-06-12 23:32:13.971741

The House Freedom Caucus – a group of hardline conservatives – recently wrote Senate Republicans, warning them to retain provisions rolling back investments in green energy, notably tax credits in President Joe Biden’s 2022 “Inflation Reduction Act.”

More moderate House and Senate Republicans have argued for slowing the repeals or preserving the credits entirely.

This poses a political problem for the GOP. The House passed the bill by just one vote. Senate Republicans can only lose three votes (assuming Democrats stay unified).

Into the breach comes Built For America, a campaign to save the tax credits led by a Republican, former West Virginia Lt. Gov. Mitch Carmichael, who also headed economic development for the state.

The group says it plans to spend $2 million to reach Trump and his inner circle – with ads on the president’s Truth Social network, Rumble, Fox News, conservative podcasts, digital trucks buzzing Trump-aligned establishments, etc.

DECISION POINTS:

GOP Ties L.A. to ‘Beautiful’ Trump Bill

Decision Points sat down with Carmichael to kick the tires and check under the hood a little. Our conservation has been edited for length and clarity.

What’s the goal of this campaign?

“The goal is to preserve and to extend the manufacturing tax credits that are really fueling the American reassertion of manufacturing and keeping energy prices lower than they would otherwise be. They're currently igniting what I consider an industrial revolution, and certainly in West Virginia and Appalachia but I think throughout the nation – that's the goal, the ultimate goal.

“The key piece here that I think needs to be emphasized is that these aren't handouts at all. These are absolutely incentives for companies to invest their own money, to hire American citizens and to provide low cost energy products and services that are again fueling the manufacturing revolution.”

Is there a project that stands out in your mind?

“There’s a long-term battery storage system that will provide employment for over 750 people in our state.. Those are families that will be living in our state, and this is in an area that had been devastated by the closing of some steel mills.

“This is about that person who's going to get a job in an innovative industry, with a long-term prospect to provide for their family and create a future in areas that vastly supported President Trump. … This is what President Trump promised to deliver on, and this is such a great tool to do that. And so we're just making sure that there are those out there who are aware of how beneficial these credits are.”

How will you reach Trump and his inner circle?

“Bringing forth the business advantage to these programs. A lot of people want to position things as some climate ideology, or some – as some people would call it – a ‘green new scam.’ That's not what this is about. And somebody like myself who is dedicated to economic development, from a state that still wants to embrace all of our historic industries, like coal, oil, natural gas, steel, making, all those things … can speak to the issue from an economic perspective, not all the other background noise.

“This is purely and simply about establishing manufacturing dominance, reasserting energy dominance, and ensuring that we have the critical and vital resources, mineral resources, rare earth elements and so forth. These tax credits incentivize all that development. They're not a handout, Olivier. They are a reward for investing money and producing and providing service and that product.”

Do you think green energy, writ large, has a political branding problem?

“I think it does in certain areas. You know, my brother in law is a coal miner. We know what it's like to work hard in a fossil fuel industry, but to a person here, we want jobs and opportunity, and so if this clean energy transition occurs, we want it to happen here. And this is a great tool for President Trump to use to deliver on his promise to reassert that American dominance in these areas (energy and manufacturing).”",https://www.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/3637de9/2147483647/thumbnail/970x647/quality/85/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.usnews.com%2Fcmsmedia%2Ffb%2F49%2F55b75bb14d05a4126632f7d9e2db%2Fgettyimages-1417180248.jpg,N,,2025-06-12 23:32:18.132630

US Environmental Protection Agency administrator Lee Zeldin on Wednesday announced two EPA proposals to roll back emission limits for power plants on greenhouse gases, mercury, and particulate matter. Under one proposed rule, the EPA would repeal all greenhouse gas (GHG) emission standards for fossil fuel–fired power plants, undoing standards instituted during the administrations of Barack Obama and Joe Biden for new and existing plants. A second proposal would undo Biden-era rules to tighten the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS) for power plants and return them to 2012 standards. The proposals come almost 3 months after Zeldin said the EPA is reviewing 31 regulatory actions for potential rollback.

“Today is a historic day for the EPA,” Zeldin said during the announcement. “We are proposing to repeal Obama and Biden rules that have been criticized as regulating coal, oil, and gas out of existence.” The proposed changes will ensure that people in the US will have access to plentiful and cheap electricity, he said. “Today, EPA is taking an important step reclaiming sanity and sound policy illustrating that we can both protect the environment and grow the economy.”

The proposed changes could impact the chemical industry and other sectors of the economy by reducing the price of power. “Ensuring affordable and reliable energy supplies drives down the costs of transportation, heating, utilities, farming, and manufacturing while boosting our national security,” the EPA says in a press release.

When are GHG emissions ‘significant’?

Under the Clean Air Act, the EPA is required to regulate industrial sources if they’re a significant contributor to air pollution, says Jeffrey Holmstead, former assistant administrator of the EPA’s Office of Air and Radiation and now a lawyer at the firm Bracewell. In the GHG proposal, the agency argues that emissions from US fossil fuel–fired power plants don’t qualify as a “significant” source of global GHG emissions, although the proposal doesn’t give the current amount of emissions. The EPA suggests that the definition of a significant emissions should be determined by ""the impacts and effects of statutory policy considerations"" rather than by a quantitative measure of volume of GHG emissions. A recent study by the Institute for Policy Integrity found that the US power sector contributed 5% of global GHG emissions between 1990 and 2002. If it were a country, the sector would have been the sixth-biggest global emitter of GHGs in this time frame.

“It's not terribly surprising that that's the route they're taking for power plants,” Holmstead says. What counts as ‘significant’ isn’t a scientific issue but more of a judgment call, he says. And it’s one that the current EPA is going to make, according to Zeldin. After the proposed rule goes through a public comment period, “we will make a decision on whether or not it is a significant contributor,” Zeldin said during a question-and-answer period with reporters after the announcement. “It is a decision I will have to make at the end of this process, and I look forward to doing so,” he said.

The EPA’s proposal indicates that the changes to GHG emission standards would save the power sector about $1.2 billion a year over the next 20 years.

Mercury to head back to 2012 limits

Zeldin also announced Wednesday that the EPA is proposing to eliminate another restrictions on how much mercury and other toxic compounds power plants can release into the air. In 2024, the Biden administration passed tighter limits under the MATS rule, reducing the amount of filterable particulate matter and Hg that coal-fired electric plants could emit by about one-third each. When promulgating that rule, the EPA said that tighter restrictions on these emissions were especially important to protect children’s developing brains and in communities near power plants who regularly eat fish with high accumulated levels of the pollutants. The agency projected then that this tighter MATS rule would create $300 million in total health benefits and $130 million in climate benefits between 2028 and 2037.

In the proposal for the new rule, the EPA says that the revisions to the MATS rule weren’t necessary, “as they impose large compliance costs or raise potential technical feasibility concerns.” The agency says that repealing the 2024 MATS amendments would save about $120 million a year in regulatory costs over the next 10 years, or a total of about $1.2 billion.

“The Trump EPA’s proposed repeal of these life-saving clean air protections is dangerous to the health, safety and well-being of all Americans,” Vickie Patton, general counsel of the advocacy group the Environmental Defense Fund, says in a statement. “Power plants are already among the largest sources of mercury, toxic and climate-destabilizing pollution in the nation, and these proposals would allow them to pour more of that pollution into our air. These pollutants are associated with deaths, serious illnesses and hospitalizations, and increased medical costs. The Trump EPA is pursuing this irresponsible action even though we have widely available technologies that allow power plants to reduce pollution with proven cost-effective solutions.”

The US Chamber of Commerce supports the proposed changes. “While we are reviewing the full proposal, the voiding of the prior rule would remove a barrier to producing the electricity generation needed to maintain our domestic energy security and our competitive edge in critical fields like artificial intelligence,” Marty Durbin, president of the US Chamber's Global Energy Institute, says in a statement.

The EPA will hold a public hearing about both proposed rules 15 days after they appear in the Federal Register, and the proposals will be open for public comment for 30 days after the publication date.","https://s7d1.scene7.com/is/image/CENODS/EPA-removes-greenhouse-gas-limits-for-power-plants--revokes-Hg-rule---99552?$responsive$&wid=700&qlt=90,0&resMode=sharp2",N,,2025-06-12 23:35:36.747110

Under the direction of President Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress, however, it is facing significant reforms in the name of efficiency that environmental advocates say could erode the act’s effectiveness.

Multiple actions — including Trump’s executive orders around energy, changes to regulations and guidance, the May Supreme Court decision on the Uinta Basin rail project and Republicans’ budget package — could mean big changes for the act.

Since its passage in the 1970s, NEPA has been lauded as the bedrock for environmental policy in the United States.

“Although we have substantive statutes like the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act, these are all siloed approaches to addressing the environment,” said Jonathan Skinner-Thompson, an associate professor at the University of Colorado Law School, where he specializes in administrative and environmental law. “Only NEPA requires a comprehensive and holistic review of environmental impacts.”

NEPA requires federal agencies to assess the environmental impacts of proposed actions such as issuing development permits, adopting federal land management actions, creating new recreation opportunities, building highways and publicly-owned facilities, and more.

Does NEPA need to change or modernize?

The Republican proposals, directives from the Trump administration and recent court decisions suggest that the act has grown beyond its initial intent and requires reforms to increase the efficiency of environmental reviews.

“NEPA today is used to stonewall any project opposition groups want to deny,” said Melissa Simpson, the newly appointed president of the Western Energy Alliance. “It’s not what Congress envisioned 50 years ago. NEPA needs to be reformed and every producer of energy, regardless of form, recognizes that fact.”

The Western Energy Alliance is a trade group representing oil and gas companies in 13 states, including Colorado, and has supported many of the recent directives around NEPA.

Project 2025 — a conservative playbook written ahead of Trump’s election and inauguration — referred to NEPA as a “tree-killing, project-dooming, decade-spanning monstrosity” that has been abused to “advance a radical climate agenda.”

The plan recommended the administration and Congress make “common sense” reforms to the policy and return it to the initial intent, which it argues was “a short, succinct, timely presentation of information regarding major federal action that significantly affects the quality of the human environment so that decision makers can make informed decisions to benefit the American people.”

One of the reforms recommended in Project 2025 is to eliminate judicial review of NEPA actions, which is targeted in the proposed changes to the policy in the reconciliation bill passed by the House. Environmental advocates argue NEPA could also be impacted by the Supreme Court’s Uinta Basin decision.

The recent proposals and changes have led to rising concerns from lawmakers, communities, and environmental advocates that NEPA could lose some of its most important functions, namely public input, and lead to less rigorous and holistic reviews of proposed actions.

“You really see actions being taken that will weaken NEPA to the point where it won’t have any of its desired effects anymore,” said Paul Sanford, director of equitable access policy at The Wilderness Society. Sanford runs the NEPA team at the advocacy organization focused on public land protection.

What’s happening with NEPA would “obliterate both of the purposes” of the act, he said, adding that first, it ensures that a government agency “bases its decisions on sound science and a careful analysis of the potential impacts” of any action, permit, or decision being made. And second, it provides a mechanism for private citizens to have a voice in government processes.

Some changes to NEPA could have an outsized impact on Colorado’s mountain cities and towns, where public land surrounds communities and economies are centered on tourism and recreation.

Jamie Ervin, the senior policy manager at Outdoor Alliance, a coalition of 10 member-based organizations representing outdoor recreation interests, said the act is “core to how the outdoor recreation community interacts with the public lands agencies.”

“Environmental health is important to (the outdoor recreation) community because we love to get outside, and we don’t want to be in polluted landscapes and developed areas,” Ervin said. “The public comment and public input process that NEPA affords us is often the way that we come to understand what agencies are planning to do on public lands that are valuable for outdoor recreation.”

Concerns about the effectiveness and timeliness of NEPA reviews come through on both sides of the argument about these policy changes. However, both sides offer different explanations for the cause.

“Most of the situations in which delays have occurred can be attributed to one of a number of things that really aren’t NEPA’s fault; there is a shortage of staff and staff time to complete analyses,” Sandford said.

To support this, Sanford cited a 2022 research study , which studied over 41,000 NEPA decisions completed by the U.S. Forest Service between 2004 and 2020. The Forest Service conducts more environmental impact statements than any other federal agency. It claimed that these statements represent less than 1% of all NEPA decisions, but that data on other decisions is limited. The study concluded that delays were most often attributed to staff turnover, inadequate budgets, delays in receiving information from applications and more.

Ervin called it a “myth” that projects always take multiple years, noting “a lot of things happen fairly quickly. However, he indicated that recent workforce reductions won’t help.

“The gutting of the federal land management agencies through budget cuts being proposed is going to severely limit their ability to do rigorous NEPA analysis at all,” he added. “We are open to making (NEPA) more efficient while keeping guardrails in place and achieving the environmental part of its mission.”

In the House Natural Resources Committee’s proposal for the budget reconciliation package, it claimed that NEPA’s environmental analyses have added significant time and cost burdens to development projects. The committee’s report claims that “constant litigation” is one of the main factors contributing to excessive bureaucracy, citing a study from Breakthrough Institute. The California think tank reported that NEPA-related litigation, on average, takes 4.2 years to resolve.

“Activist groups are using federal courts to force limitless environmental reviews that go far beyond the scope of a project,” Simpson said.

She claimed that “on average, it takes 4.5 years to complete an environmental impact statement.”

What changes is NEPA facing?

Pulling back the Council on Environmental Quality’s NEPA regulations

The current administration — aligning with recent court decisions that concluded the Council on Environmental Quality does not have the legal authority to issue regulations and bind federal agencies to their interpretation of NEPA — issued a rule earlier this year removing the council regulations for the act. These regulations historically gave federal agencies a baseline set of rules to adopt.

“The rescission is final and CEQ has reportedly directed agencies to consider updating their existing NEPA rules instead of replacing them with nonbinding guidance as CEQ originally instructed,” Skinner-Thompson said, adding that any regulation changes would be subject to public review and still need to comply with NEPA as written.

It’s too early to tell how this could change NEPA processes, but there are some concerns that it could decrease its potency.

“The (CEQ) regulations ensured a relatively consistent application of NEPA across the federal family,” Sanford said. “I think we’re going to see a greater degree of inconsistency, a greater degree of variance in the way that agencies fulfill their NEPA obligations, and we’re going to see less science and less opportunities for public participation.”

Simpson said the Western Energy Alliance is waiting to see how this changes interagency coordination on projects.

“The implications for a small project like a specific well pad are not as significant as with a major infrastructure that involves multiple agencies,” Simpson said.

Supreme Court narrows scope of NEPA

In late May, a Supreme Court ruling on the proposed 88-mile Uinta Basin Railway narrowed the scope of what environmental impacts an agency is required to analyze under NEPA.

“The decision stressed that NEPA is ‘purely procedural’ and that NEPA does not require agencies to consider upstream/downstream impacts from projects that are separate in time or place from the action that is subject to NEPA review,” Skinner-Thompson said.

In the case, the plaintiffs (Eagle County and five environmental groups) argued that the review of the railway failed to study downstream impacts such as how increased rail traffic would impact wildfire risk and impacts on water resources and other biological resources.

Simpson said the ruling affirms that NEPA has “limits that have been far exceeded by opposition groups and numerous judges.”

“The court made clear NEPA must be limited to the scope of the project at hand and not every potential impact that could be possibly imagined,” she said.

The ruling also reaffirms that courts should defer to agencies on things like “the appropriate scope of analysis under NEPA (and where it should reasonably end),” Skinner-Thompson said, adding that this contrasts with the 2024 Supreme Court Loper Bright ruling that said the opposite.

Sanford warned that the ruling could have significant consequences.

“What’s going to happen is agencies are now sort of authorized to look at things in isolation without taking a look at what’s going to happen down the road,” Sanford said. “That’s going to really open the door to a lot of potential environmental effects that will have adverse effects on people and on communities that will go unidentified and unanalyzed.”

Sanford argued that this will also curtail the ability of individuals to challenge NEPA actions in court.

“It will be more difficult to prove that an agency’s NEPA analysis was insufficient and too narrow to adequately evaluate the environmental impacts of an agency decision,” he said. “A right without a remedy is no right at all, and this has the effect of taking away the public’s remedy.”

Trump’s one big bill proposes big changes to NEPA

Legal review is also threatened in the NEPA changes proposed in Trump’s “One Big, Beautiful Bill Act.”

As proposed, project sponsors could pay a fee to fast-track the NEPA process: one year for an environmental impact statement and six months for an environmental assessment. When sponsors pay the fee — set at 125% of the costs to prepare the assessment — it would also shield the review from judicial review.

The changes were included in the bill that was passed by the House in May and mirrored in the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee proposal for the reconciliation package as it now makes its way through the chamber.

The House committee Republicans claimed in a memo that the changes would streamline a NEPA process that has become “increasingly complex, resulting in unwieldy NEPA documents and timelines and increased frivolous litigation.”

As proposed, Simpson said it would “prevent abuse by opposition groups who seek endless judicial reviews as a means to halting economic development.”

However, there are concerns that these changes would dismantle the intended purpose of NEPA.

“If the House bill becomes law, it would essentially neuter the NEPA process (by preventing parties from being able to go to court over a NEPA analysis),” Skinner-Thompson said. “If parties can’t go to court, and if they can’t get an injunction, NEPA won’t really mean anything.”

The fee model would “advantage big developers and companies with a lot of money,” Ervin said.

“And it’s just not how the process is intended to work,” he added.

The fight for the heart of NEPA isn’t over, Sanford emphasized.

“We’re going to continue to fight for those principles and try to ensure that the purposes of NEPA are fulfilled, that agencies make sound decisions based on valid science and that the public has the opportunity to play a role in the process of deciding what happens in their communities,” he said.",https://swiftmedia.s3.amazonaws.com/mountain.swiftcom.com/images/sites/5/2025/06/12144829/PineyLake-CDillmann.jpeg,N,,2025-06-12 23:34:40.712046

President Donald Trump has signed a congressional resolution reversing a waiver previously granted to California and other states that would have let them ban the sale of gasoline-powered cars, trucks and sport-utility vehicles.
The signing also happened as Trump and California Gov.
Trump said the California waiver, which is provided for under the Clean Air Act, ""has been a disaster for this country.""
The most recent waiver allowed the state to effectively end the sale of gas-powered cars and trucks in the state by 2035.","President Trump signed a resolution blocking California's ban on gasoline-powered vehicle sales.

California plans to sue, arguing the resolution's passing violated existing law.

Supporters say the resolution protects consumer choice and the auto industry, while critics argue it harms the environment and public health.

President Donald Trump has signed a congressional resolution reversing a waiver previously granted to California and other states that would have let them ban the sale of gasoline-powered cars, trucks and sport-utility vehicles.

At a ceremony at the White House on June 12, Trump said the resolution has the force of law and suggested it can't be challenged in court. But California officials and a coalition of officials from other states on the same day did just that, arguing it was passed in the U.S. House and Senate under a process they say violated existing law.

By signing the resolution, Trump continued to deliver on his promise to tear down rules and regulations promoting the adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) nationwide which he and other Republicans argue amounted to a mandate on American consumers regarding which cars and trucks they may buy.

The signing also happened as Trump and California Gov. Gavin Newsom continue to spar over Trump's decision to send thousands of National Guard members and some 700 Marines to that state in support of efforts to respond to protests against immigration enforcement by the Trump administration. No such military intervention has been ordered into a state by the federal government without the state's request since the 1960s.

Trump said the California waiver, which is provided for under the Clean Air Act, ""has been a disaster for this country."" He added that by signing the resolution, he was moving to ""rescue the American auto industry.""

But Trump repeatedly seemed to suggest that the resolution somehow ends the federal government's requirement to consider and approve California's waivers on fuel emissions standards on cars and trucks except for under narrow legal circumstances. The resolution passed by the U.S. House and Senate only dealt with a waiver granted to California — and more than a dozen other states which are allowed to follow California's lead on car and truck emissions standards — about a month before former President Joe Biden left office in January.

The Trump administration, under Environmental Protection Agency head Lee Zeldin, asked Congress to overturn the Biden waiver for California's so-called Advanced Clean Cars II program under the Congressional Review Act, which lets Congress reverse certain agency rules within a short time of their implementation. Most importantly, the Congressional Review Act allows the U.S. Senate to adopt those reversals with a simple 52-vote majority, rather than a 60-vote margin needed to shut down debate.

But the review act has never been applied to California's waivers under the Clean Air Act and the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO), which provides nonpartisan recommendations to Congress and federal public agencies, has formally said that those waivers can't be considered under that law.

California Attorney General Rob Bonta called Trump's actions ""reckless, politically motivated and illegal.""

California's ability to get waivers to set fuel emissions standards has been in place for decades as a way to fight pollution in a state where smog has been a huge problem. The most recent waiver allowed the state to effectively end the sale of gas-powered cars and trucks in the state by 2035.

Trump signed other resolutions reversing a few other California Clean Air Act waivers, as well, on June 12, including a measure sponsored by U.S. Rep. John James, R-Shelby Township, which overturns California's program to require heavy trucks also emit no greenhouse gases. James attended the signing ceremony and was acknowledged by Trump. The resolution overturning the California program affecting a ban on gas-powered cars and light-duty trucks and SUVs was sponsored by U.S. Rep. John Joyce, R-Pennsylvania.

Trump said his move will save consumers thousands on new cars and trucks, though that may not take into account fuel costs that EVs can save their owners over the lives of their vehicles.

The White House put out a statement June 12 from General Motors with the automaker saying, ""We appreciate the actions taken by President Trump to sign (the resolution) into law and help align emissions standards with today’s market realities. We have long advocated for one national standard that will allow us to stay competitive, continue to invest in U.S. innovation, and offer customer choice across the broadest lineup of gas-powered and electric vehicles.”

GM and other automakers have long argued that California and the states that follow it shouldn't be allowed to effectively decide what kind of cars and trucks they have to make for the whole country. But in more recent years — certainly since the Obama administration stepped in to financially rescue GM and what is now Stellantis in 2009 — automakers have been more willing to work to avoid legal fights over fuel standards with California.

As to the most recent California standards, John Bozzella, president and CEO of the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, an industry trade group in Washington, said, “Everyone agreed these EV sales mandates were never achievable and wildly unrealistic"" and, if they remained in place would be, ""harmful to auto affordability, to consumer choice, to industry competitiveness and to economic activity.""

[ Help us improve the Free Press experience! Take our short survey. ]

He credited Trump for ""identifying this problem and doing something about it.""

Meanwhile, American Petroleum Institute President and CEO Mike Sommers and American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers President and CEO Chet Thompson issued a statement calling the resolution, along with others reversing some other vehicle mandates earlier provided to California, ""a major win for the American people.""

Environmental groups criticized the resolution, as they had on its passage last month.

“California’s vehicle standards reduce costs for drivers, increase customer choice, boost domestic manufacturing, improve air quality and help address the climate crisis,"" said Simon Mui, managing director for transportation at the Natural Resources Defense Council. ""The only losers from cleaner vehicles are oil industry billionaires."" Several officials from the oil industry were on hand as the president signed the resolution.

“Ripping away California’s clean air protections is Trump’s latest betrayal of democracy,” added Dan Becker, director of the Center for Biological Diversity’s Safe Climate Transport Campaign. “Signing this bill is a flagrant abuse of the law to reward big oil and big auto corporations at the expense of everyday people’s health and their wallets.""

South Carolina has become one of the top destinations for new clean energy investments since federal clean energy tax credits passed in 2022.
The Trump administration has threatened three clean energy projects in South Carolina, jeopardizing over $1.76 billion in clean energy investments and 1,520 jobs.
It also repeals home energy tax credits, which would lead directly to higher energy costs, in addition to good-paying jobs.
Repealing clean energy tax credits would gut America’s clean energy production, raising costs for South Carolina families and killing hundreds of thousands of good-paying manufacturing jobs nationwide.","As an Ironworkers member in South Carolina representing over 400 workers, I know firsthand how important clean energy is to making our economy work for all of us. Investments in clean energy have enabled our union locals to create good-paying jobs, and drive down energy costs — something at the top of every South Carolinian's mind — all while helping America maintain our global competitiveness.

The House budget reconciliation bill, however, proposes what amounts to a total repeal of clean energy investments, putting our jobs at risk. As the Solar Energy Industries Association, the primary trade organization for the solar industry, put it: “This proposed legislation will effectively dismantle the most successful industrial onshoring effort in U.S. history.” Let’s be clear: This bill is a direct assault on American manufacturing and American-made energy right here in South Carolina.

I have seen the benefits of clean energy investments myself. With clean energy projects happening across the Carolinas I’ve seen firsthand where these investments affect the workforce and their families in a positive way. Bringing these investments to South Carolinians and their families is a must for growth in this great state.

I strongly support clean energy investments at both the federal level and in the private sector because they are fueling a clean energy economic boom. South Carolina has become one of the top destinations for new clean energy investments since federal clean energy tax credits passed in 2022. Over 22,312 jobs have been created with $14.37 billion in investment, and 7 percent of our state’s energy is powered by clean energy like solar. That amounts to 13.5 gigawatts of operating clean energy capacity, enough to power 450,000 homes.

Unfortunately, we have already seen how extreme Republican attempts to repeal clean energy are impacting South Carolina’s energy supply and jobs. The Trump administration has threatened three clean energy projects in South Carolina, jeopardizing over $1.76 billion in clean energy investments and 1,520 jobs.

These projects include the Envision AESC Battery Manufacturing Facility in Florence County, which would supply battery cells for BMW’s plant in Spartanburg — establishing a homegrown supply chain right here in South Carolina. In February 2025, however, AESC walked back a planned expansion of its ""gigafactory"" due to slower expected growth in EV sales, eliminating over 1,000 expected jobs.

U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham, who has represented us since 2003, has celebrated new clean energy investments in the state, including major EV manufacturing investments from Scout Motors and BMW. The House bill would stifle this growth, putting in jeopardy the $32 billion the clean energy sector was projected to add to South Carolina’s economy over the next decade.

He has also praised clean energy as an engine for increased national security, writing in an op-ed with Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, “We are a conservative Republican and a progressive Democrat who disagree on a great many things. We write today, however, to highlight an area of strong agreement: a global transition to renewable energy would greatly assist in our nation’s fight against the world’s most corrupt and illicit regimes. If you could wave a magic wand, and transition the world away from fossil fuels, Americans would instantly be safer.”

On April 9, four of Sen. Graham’s Republican colleagues wrote a letter to Senate Majority Leader John Thune in support of the clean energy tax credits that have brought direct benefits to so many parts of the country.

“As Republicans committed to strengthening America’s energy security and economic growth, we write to emphasize the importance of maintaining a stable and predictable tax framework to promote domestic energy development. While we support fiscal responsibility and prudent efforts to streamline the tax code, we caution against the full-scale repeal of current credits, which could lead to significant disruptions for the American people and weaken our position as a global energy leader,” they wrote in their letter.

This is exactly right. Unfortunately, the House bill will implement unreasonable phase-outs, impossible red tape and restrictions, or outright termination of tax credits for clean energy that together make the tax credits completely unworkable, by design. Simply put, this bill is a full-scale repeal. It also repeals home energy tax credits, which would lead directly to higher energy costs, in addition to good-paying jobs.

Repealing clean energy tax credits would gut America’s clean energy production, raising costs for South Carolina families and killing hundreds of thousands of good-paying manufacturing jobs nationwide. President Donald Trump and Republicans promised to lower energy costs. Instead, this legislation would undermine America’s fastest-growing, most affordable energy sources.

Thankfully, Sen. Graham has an opportunity to inject some common sense into this bill and protect clean energy and the jobs that come along with it. Repealing clean energy investments would be bad for American businesses and bad for American workers. I urge Sen. Graham to continue being the leader we need and fix this reckless legislation.

The stakes are high: whoever balances these pressures best may define not just the future of the cloud, but the shape of transatlantic digital power in the AI age.","As artificial intelligence boosts demand for cloud computing, the US and Europe are pursuing strikingly different strategies. The US prioritizes speed and fossil fuels, while Europe preaches cautious growth aligned with climate goals.

The allies confront a common challenge: AI’s ferocious energy appetite. A recent MIT study warns that the AI revolution may outpace the world’s power capacity. US data centers already consume 4.4% of national power, and consumption could triple by 2030.

The allies disagree on how to respond. In Washington, President Trump has set a clear agenda: unleash fossil-fueled energy to win the AI race. New executive orders proliferate. They fast-track permits for data center power plants, many gas-fired, as part of what officials call an “AI Manhattan Project.” Sixteen potential government-owned sites have been identified for AI mega-centers with dedicated energy supplies. AI’s continued growth without exacerbating ecological damage is unrealistic. For President Trump, speed is paramount, and sustainability goals come second – if at all.

Across the Atlantic, Europe is sticking to its green transition playbook. EU data centers already use about 3% of the bloc’s electricity and consumption could more than double by 2030, adding as much as the power needs of Spain.

Europe’s industrial power costs remain nearly twice those in the US, widening a competitiveness gap. The continent has greenlighted tough, binding climate targets: a 55% emission cut by 2030 and net-zero by 2050. To square these pressures, Brussels is imposing strict reporting and energy efficiency rules for data centers, including mandatory green energy sourcing. The EU insists digital expansion cannot undercut climate commitments.

No country illustrates Europe’s dilemma better than Ireland. Once the continent’s digital darling, Ireland now faces grid strain so severe that data centers consume a fifth of national power, with the figure set to rise in coming years. The state grid operator has imposed a moratorium on new data center connections around Dublin through at least 2028. Irish lawmakers back this pause, fearing it would otherwise jeopardize the country’s renewable goals. Industry, meanwhile, warns of losing out.

Although some data center operators are pushing to build their own private gas turbines to circumvent grid restrictions, these plans face local resistance and permitting delays. Ireland’s experience encapsulates the larger European conundrum: how to balance digital growth with grid stability and decarbonization.

The debate highlights a deep ideological split. Washington’s fossil-fueled surge reflects a bet that near-term energy abundance will cement AI and cloud dominance. This approach echoes broader American energy pragmatism, which has led the US to leverage cheap gas and fast-tracked permits to build data capacity at breakneck speed.

In contrast, Europe’s deliberate expansion – slowed by green mandates and high energy costs – risks eroding competitiveness and ceding ground to US providers. Cloud infrastructure is not just an economic issue but a geopolitical one. Europe’s reliance on American cloud giants could deepen if constrained grid access stifles homegrown data expansion.

Despite the deep divergence, flickers of convergence are visible. Major US cloud computing companies are investing in greener solutions. Google, Microsoft, and Amazon have signed massive renewable energy deals. In the US, they are even funding small modular nuclear reactor pilots to decarbonize future data center fleets. In Europe, Amazon’s new Dublin facility pledges to run entirely on green power and to feed waste heat into local heating networks. Already, excess heat from a Microsoft data center north of Amsterdam powers a gigantic greenhouse. A Google data center in Finland provides heat to the local municipality free of charge.

Time will tell if these corporate initiatives emerge as a model for sustainable growth. But the efforts suggest that industry sees climate stewardship not as a luxury but as essential for long-term viability.

Even so, the near-term trajectories are clear. The US is moving fast, even if that means higher emissions, while Europe insists on a slower, greener expansion – despite risking competitiveness. Each side is watching closely: Brussels sees US deregulation as climate backsliding; Washington sees EU caution as self-inflicted digital decline.

Ultimately, the data center boom captures the larger question of how to green the digital economy without sacrificing innovation or energy security. The stakes are high: whoever balances these pressures best may define not just the future of the cloud, but the shape of transatlantic digital power in the AI age.

The House bill introduces provisions that would effectively kill tax credits for clean and advanced manufacturing by making them unusable and sunsetting them early.

The BlueGreen Alliance’s brief concludes that the provisions in the House bill would put at risk nearly 300,000 direct manufacturing jobs in facilities supported by clean manufacturing tax credits, over one million indirect jobs down the supply chain, and nearly 643,000 induced jobs created as a result of the economic stimulus of the direct and indirect jobs.

“These numbers make it even more clear, if this bill becomes law, workers are the ones who will pay the price,” said BlueGreen Alliance Executive Director Jason Walsh. “As this administration blusters about its support for American manufacturing, this bill tells an extremely different story, openly selling out workers to pay for a billionaire tax break.”

Seven states—California, Georgia, Michigan, Illinois, Tennessee, Arizona, and South Carolina—have more than 100,000 jobs at risk if the clean manufacturing tax credits are repealed. Notably, President Trump won five of those seven states with the greatest number of jobs at stake in the 2024 election.

Additionally, the brief finds that in several states the manufacturing sector is at the precipice of massive growth under the tax credits. With the tax credits in place, New Mexico, Nevada, and Georgia could all see manufacturing employment grow more than 10%. Arizona, Kentucky, Michigan, South Carolina, Tennessee, and West Virginia could all see at least a 5% boost. Without the credits, that future is uncertain.

“The job-creating track record of the clean manufacturing tax credits is undeniable and the changes to them included in the House bill threatens all of that progress,” said BlueGreen Alliance Vice President of Manufacturing and Industrial Policy Ted Fertik. “Every bit of data shows clearly that repealing these credits will hurt working Americans.

Natural gas-powered electricity generators have been the leading source of electricity in the country since 2016.

Combined-cycle gas turbines (CCGTs), known for their efficiency and flexibility, continue to play an essential role in maintaining grid stability in the US.

These units can quickly adjust output levels in response to fluctuations in demand and supply, which is increasingly important as renewable energy sources become more prevalent within the power mix.

A CCGT has a lifespan of between 25 and 30 years, which can be extended by upgrading, repairing and maintaining the components.

Despite this, only one new CCGT unit was commissioned in 2024 – an addition at Plaquemines liquefied natural gas export terminal, contributing 98MW.

This slowdown reflects a growing emphasis on renewables such as solar, wind power and battery storage systems, spurred by their decreasing costs and supportive federal policies that incentivise green investments.

Developers have scheduled additions totalling 1.6GW of CCGT with completion in 2025 alone.

This includes projects such as the Intermountain Power Project in Utah and Magnolia Power in Louisiana that will feature hydrogen co-firing capabilities, with a 1.5GW combined capacity.

The 1,100-page bill would slash incentives for green technologies such as solar, wind, batteries, electric cars, and heat pumps while subsidizing existing nuclear power plants and biofuels. That would leave the country and its people burning more fossil fuels despite strong popular and scientific support for a rapid shift to renewable energy.

The bill may still be revised by the Senate before it moves to a final vote. But it is a picture of how President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans want to reshape U.S. energy policy.

As an environmental engineering professor who studies ways to confront climate change, I think it is important to distinguish which technologies could rapidly cut emissions or are on the verge of becoming viable from those that do little to fight climate change. Unfortunately, the House bill favors the latter while nixing support for the former.

Renewable energy

Wind and solar power, often paired with batteries, are providing more than 90% of the new electricity currently being added to the grid nationally and around the world. Geothermal power is undergoing technological breakthroughs. With natural gas turbines in short supply and long lead times to build other resources, renewables and batteries offer the fastest way to satisfy growing demand for power.

However, the House bill rescinds billions of dollars that the Inflation Reduction Act, enacted in 2022, devoted to boosting domestic manufacturing and deployments of renewable energy and batteries.

It would terminate tax credits for manufacturing for the wind industry in 2028 and for solar and batteries in 2032. That would disrupt the boom in domestic manufacturing projects that was being stimulated by the Inflation Reduction Act.

Deployments would be hit even harder. Wind, solar, geothermal, and battery projects would need to commence construction within 60 days of passage of the bill to receive tax credits.

In addition, the bill would deny tax credits to projects that use Chinese-made components. Financial analysts have called those provisions “unworkable,” since some Chinese materials may be necessary even for projects built with as much domestic content as possible.

Analysts warn that the House bill would cut new wind, solar, and battery installations by 20% compared with the growth that had been expected without the bill. That’s why BloombergNEF, an energy research firm, called the bill a “nightmare scenario” for clean energy proponents.

However, one person’s nightmare may be another man’s dream. “We’re constraining the hell out of wind and solar, which is good,” said Representative Chip Roy, a Texas Republican backed by the oil and gas industry.

Efficiency and electric cars

Cuts fall even harder on Americans who are trying to reduce their carbon footprints and energy costs. The bill repeals aid for home efficiency improvements such as heat pumps, efficient windows, and energy audits. Homeowners would also lose tax credits for installing solar panels and batteries.

For vehicles, the bill would not only repeal tax credits for electric cars, trucks, and chargers, but it also would impose a federal $250 annual fee on vehicles, on top of fees that some states charge electric-car owners. The federal fee is more than the gas taxes paid by other drivers to fund highways and ignores air-quality and climate effects.

Combined, the lost credits and increased fees could cut projected U.S. sales of electric vehicles by 40% in 2030, according to modeling by Jesse Jenkins of Princeton University.

Nuclear power

Meanwhile, the bill partially retains a tax credit for electricity from existing nuclear power plants. Those plants may not need the help: Electricity demand is surging, and companies like Meta are signing long-term deals for nuclear energy to power data centers. Nuclear plants are also paid to manage their radioactive waste, since the country lacks a permanent place to store it.

For new nuclear plants, the bill would move up the deadline to 2028 to begin construction. That deadline is too soon for some new reactor designs and would rush the vetting of others. Nuclear safety regulators are awaiting a study from the National Academies on the weapons proliferation risks of the type of uranium fuel that some developers hope to use in newer designs.

Biofuels

While cutting funding for electric vehicles, the bill would spend $45 billion to extend tax credits for biofuels such as ethanol and biodiesel.

Food-based biofuels do little good for the climate because growing, harvesting, and processing crops requires fertilizers, pesticides, and fuel. The bill would allow forests to be cut to make room for crops because it directs agencies to ignore the impacts of biofuels on land use.

Hydrogen

The bill would end tax credits for hydrogen production. Without that support, companies will be unlikely to invest in the seven so-called hydrogen hubs that were allocated a combined $8 billion under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law in 2021. Those hubs aim to attract $40 billion in private investments and create tens of thousands of jobs while developing cleaner ways to make hydrogen.

The repealed tax credits would have subsidized hydrogen made emissions-free by using renewable or nuclear electricity to split water molecules. They also would have subsidized hydrogen made from natural gas with carbon capture, whose benefits are impaired by methane emissions from natural gas systems and incomplete carbon capture.

However it’s made, hydrogen is no panacea. As the world’s smallest molecule, hydrogen is prone to leaking, which can pose safety challenges and indirectly warm the climate. And while hydrogen is essential for making fertilizers and potentially useful for making steel or aviation fuels, vehicles and heating are more efficiently powered by electricity than by hydrogen.

Still, European governments and China are investing heavily in hydrogen production.

Summing it up

The conservative Tax Foundation estimates that the House bill would cut the Inflation Reduction Act’s clean energy tax credits by about half, saving the government $50 billion a year. But with fewer efficiency improvements, fewer electric vehicles, and less clean power on the grid, Princeton’s Jenkins projects American households would pay up to $415 more per year for energy by 2035 than if the bill’s provisions were not enacted. If the bill’s provisions make it into law, the extra fossil fuel burning would leave annual U.S. greenhouse gas emissions 1 billion tons higher by then.

No one expected former President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act to escape unscathed with Republicans in the White House and dominating both houses of Congress. Still, the proposed cuts target the technologies Americans count on to protect the climate and save consumers money.

The savings for “Americans” will go entirely to power plant operators who won’t have to cut their pollution, while at the same time climate and health benefits for all Americans that are 20 times larger in dollar terms will be deleted.
However, this “saving” is entirely for the benefit of power plant operators who won’t have to install technology to reduce hazardous pollution, rather than the broader public.
These costs are ultimately borne by consumers in the form of higher utility bills and rolling blackouts.” But critics warn that the EPA’s traditional purpose to protect public health and the environment is being rapidly eroded.
The EPA announcement makes good on Trump’s campaign trail promise to “unleash American energy” and open “dozens and dozens” of power plants.","Donald Trump’s Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) claimed on Wednesday that its plan to eviscerate power plant pollution standards will save the US about $1bn a year. In reality, though, this represents a starkly uneven trade-off, experts say.

The savings for “Americans” will go entirely to power plant operators who won’t have to cut their pollution, while at the same time climate and health benefits for all Americans that are 20 times larger in dollar terms will be deleted.

“The massive cost to the public compared to the minuscule benefits is breathtaking,” said Charles Harper, power sector campaigner at green group Evergreen Action. “The costs will be borne by the American people who will breathe dirtier air and those around the world suffering from climate change. The benefits will go to a very small group of donors. Perhaps they should change the name of the agency if they are no longer about protecting the health of Americans.”

The EPA is proposing to entirely ditch all restrictions on planet-heating emissions coming from US power plants, the second largest source of carbon pollution in the country, while also weakening a separate regulation designed to limit the amount of harmful toxins, such as mercury, seeping from these power plants into Americans’ air, water and soils.

These restrictions were imposed by Joe Biden to “advance the climate change cult” and the “green new scam”, according to Lee Zeldin, the EPA administrator, at an unveiling of the rollbacks on Wednesday that did not mention any benefit to the environment or public health.

“Together, these rules have been criticized as being designed to regulate coal, oil and gas out of existence,” said Zeldin, who touted the need for “beautiful clean coal” and for the US to develop artificial intelligence, neither a core EPA responsibility.

In justifying its decision, the EPA has claimed that power plant emissions “do not contribute significantly” to the climate crisis – despite US electricity generation being one of the largest single sources of such pollution in the world – and that the rollbacks will save the country $19bn over two decades, or about $1.2bn a year.

However, this “saving” is entirely for the benefit of power plant operators who won’t have to install technology to reduce hazardous pollution, rather than the broader public. The EPA has said overall electricity costs will go down, too, but did not provide a figure on any estimated savings from this.

By contrast, the existing climate rule for power plants, put in place by Biden last year, was previously estimated by the EPA to save the US $370bn by the 2040s, at about $20bn a year, via climate and public health benefits. The rule is also expected to slash more than 1bn tons in carbon emissions and save thousands of lives from reduced air pollution.

Experts said that the vast 20 to one discrepancy in benefits, and who they flow to, represents a damaging favor given to the fossil fuel interests that have strongly backed Trump, at the expense of the American public.

“The only people who benefit from these rollbacks are the biggest emitters of toxic pollution who don’t want to install cleaner technologies,” said Michelle Roos, executive director of the Environmental Protection Network, a group composed of former EPA staff. “American families will pay the cost of these rollbacks in higher healthcare bills from emergency room visits, missed work days and missed school days. This proposal is scientifically indefensible and represents a complete abdication of EPA’s responsibilities under the Clean Air Act.”

Under Trump, the EPA has set about dismantling an array of clean air and water protections and adopted the president’s agenda of boosting fossil fuel production. The agency argues that casting off such regulations will bolster the economy and save money for households.

“Coal and natural gas power plants are essential sources of base load power that are needed to fuel manufacturing and turn the United States into the artificial intelligence capital of the world,” said an EPA spokesperson. “Regulatory costs are inherently regressive – placing a heavier burden on those who can least afford it. These costs are ultimately borne by consumers in the form of higher utility bills and rolling blackouts.”

But critics warn that the EPA’s traditional purpose to protect public health and the environment is being rapidly eroded.

“EPA’s proposal to stop regulating emissions of greenhouse gases and mercury from US power plants reflects Trump’s breathtaking willingness to sacrifice public health and progress against climate change in the service of the nation’s worst polluters,” said John Holdren, who served as Barack Obama’s science adviser. “In this and so many other ways, Trump and his enablers are doing their best to drive this country off a cliff.

“American jobs, economic competitiveness, health, environment, national security, and standing in the world are all in peril from Trump’s ignorance and reckless disregard for the public good,” said Holdren, who now co-directs the science, technology and public policy program at Harvard University’s Belfer Center.

The EPA announcement makes good on Trump’s campaign trail promise to “unleash American energy” and open “dozens and dozens” of power plants.

It came as part of Trump’s assault on pollution regulations. Taken together, his administration’s planned environmental rollbacks – including of power plant and tailpipe emission standards and clean energy incentives from Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law – will result in 22,800 additional pollution-related deaths and a $1.1tn reduction in US GDP by 2035, a University of Maryland study published on Thursday found.

Julie McNamara, an associate director at the science, climate and health-focused advocacy group Union of Concerned Scientists, said Zeldin’s Wednesday proposal was “shameful”.

“There’s no meaningful path to meet US climate goals without addressing carbon emissions from coal- and gas-fired power plants – and there’s no meaningful path to meet global climate goals without the United States,” she said.",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8eb645de414a2b7dee45b71e97723c8b6e3c5452/1171_60_3467_2773/master/3467.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=4d4ade0784e7ae19920dc6ed34acd09d,N,,2025-06-12 23:33:44.693395

One way of complying with the rules could be through the use of carbon capture technology, but that traditionally has been too expensive for viability.

EPA had said its new standards for coal- and gas-powered plants would avoid emissions of up to 617 million metric tons of total carbon dioxide (CO2) through 2042. The proposals would also result in cutting tens of thousands of tons of particulate matter, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen oxide, the agency said at the time.

“This rule that the Biden administration put forward basically has onerous enforcement mechanisms that would basically retire every coal plant, if not before 2035, then by 2035 unless they’re capturing 90% of the carbon emissions, which is not achievable at this point,” Capito said today.

“Also natural gas — same thing. We are looking at a shortage of power in this country. We need more power, not less. And yet this Clean Power Plan would pull some of our base load power off the grid, and I think would really put us in a perilous situation.”

The Trump administration this week announced plans to roll back the policies sometimes referred to as Clean Power Plan 2.0. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said the move is necessary because Obama and Biden-era standards were “regulating coal, oil and gas out of existence.”

The U.S. Supreme Court struck down the original 2015 Clean Power Plan in West Virginia v. EPA, holding that the major questions doctrine barred EPA from leveraging the Clean Air Act to manipulate Americans’ energy choices and shift the balance of the nation’s electrical fuel mix.

Gov. Patrick Morrisey, whose office was central to the legal fight against the first Clean Power Plan when he was attorney general, also praised the Trump administration move.

“As Attorney General, I fought back against the Green New Deal and led a national coalition of states in the legal battle to stop the Clean Power Plan, securing a historic and unprecedented stay from the U.S. Supreme Court in 2016,” Morrisey said in a statement.

Now, Morrisey said, “this action by Administrator Zeldin restores constitutional order and delivers long-overdue relief to states like West Virginia that have been unfairly targeted for years.”

Congressman Riley Moore, R-W.Va., also expressed support for the Trump administration rollback of the environmental standards.

“The Biden-Harris war on affordable, reliable American energy ends today. By reversing these job-killing regulations, President Trump and Administrator Zeldin make it clear: the Green New Scam is over and American energy dominance is back,” Moore said in a statement.

“These EPA regulations would have shuttered every coal-fired power plant in America, bankrupted many coal mines, laid off thousands of coal miners, and driven up the cost of electricity for every American.”

American Electric Power described being committed to working with state and federal policymakers to find solutions for delivering affordable, reliable electricity to customers.

AEP said the prior EPA standards “would have threatened our ability to do so by requiring the use of unproven technology. We appreciate that the administration recognized the impact of this regulation and took action.

“We look forward to engaging in the rulemaking process by collaborating with stakeholders to provide robust comments during EPA’s comment period. This effort is critical for ensuring an outcome that will enable us to deliver dependable, affordable power to the communities we serve.”",https://wvmetronews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/John_Amos-power-plant-e1665216399357.jpg,N,,2025-06-12 23:33:48.964997

United Auto Workers President Shawn Fain, repesenting the largest auto worker union in the country, is a card-carrying liberal.

He campaigned for former U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris in her run against Trump and called Trump a scab, a derogatory term for a worker who crosses a picket line during a strike. He also warned that a Trump presidency would be bad for the country.

But since Trump has taken office, Fain's tune has changed.

It turns out that Trump's tariff policy is actually really good for the U.S. auto workers that Fain represents.

""We’re in a triage situation,"" Fain told ABC earlier this year. ""Tariffs are an attempt to stop the bleeding from the hemorrhaging of jobs in America for the last 33 years.""

The U.S. auto industry, including manufacturing and dealerships, employed over 2 million Americans last year. Over 1 million of those jobs were in vehicle and parts manufacturing.

The U.S. auto industry peaked in the 1970s, producing about 10 million vehicles annually.

Despite the population growing by more than 60% since then, car manufacturers produced just 10.6 million vehicles in the U.S. in 2023.

Tariffs incentivize companies to bring production home to avoid import taxes.

One of Detroit's Big 3 automakers just made a $4 billion commitment to do just that.

General Motors spends $4 billion to bring manufacturing to the U.S.

General Motors (GM) said earlier this year that auto tariffs will wipe out between $4 billion and $5 billion in EBITDA this year.

But GM CEO Mary Barra still backed the taxes, saying, “For decades now, it has not been a level playing field for us automakers globally, with either tariffs or non-tariff trade barriers. So I think tariffs is one tool that the administration can use to level the playing field.“

However, only 52% of the 2.7 million vehicles GM sold globally last year were “made in the USA.“

Of the Big 3, GM isn't even ahead of Stellantis (57%), a multinational conglomerate based in Europe, in terms of domestic production.

Ford leads the way, with 77% of the cars it sells originating from the States.

But this week, GM announced a move that could change all of that.

GM says it plans to invest $4 billion to move its Mexico production to three plants in the U.S., including the recently closed Orion Assembly plant in its hometown of Detroit.

“We believe the future of transportation will be driven by American innovation and manufacturing expertise,” Barra said in a statement. “Today’s announcement demonstrates our ongoing commitment to build vehicles in the U.S. and to support American jobs. We're focused on giving customers choice and offering a broad range of vehicles they love.”

According to The Detroit News, GM will build full-size SUVs and light-duty pickups at the Orion plant, which closed in 2023.

According to the report, the move is partly due to increased demand for high-margin SUVs and partly due to Trump's tariffs.

Closing plants in Mexico and moving production to the states is a long process, and the shift in production is not expected to take effect until 2027.

Ford also backs Trump tariffs

GM isn't the only company facing a billion-dollar charge from U.S. tariffs.

Ford revealed that the tariffs will shave at least $1.5 billion off the company's EBITDA this year, but CEO Jim Farley also praised Trump's handling of tariffs.

Ford ""supports the administration's goal to strengthen the U.S. economy by growing manufacturing.""

Car dealers are worried, and it could be great news for car buyers

One reason Ford supports the tariffs is that it already has a much stronger domestic production base than its domestic competitors.

""Last year, we assembled over 300,000 more vehicles in the U.S. than our closest competitor. That includes 100% of all our full-size trucks,"" CEO Jim Farley said during the company's last earnings call.

""In this new environment...automakers with the largest U.S. footprint will have a big advantage, and boy, is that true for Ford,"" he added.

Electric vehicle (EV) adoption interest is the lowest it has been since 2019, with the percentage of consumers indicating they would be “unlikely” or “very unlikely” to purchase an EV rising from 51% to 63%, according to an AAA survey.

The biggest barriers against consumers making the transition to fully electric vehicles are high battery repair costs (62%) and purchase price (59%). According to AAA’s 2024 Your Driving Cost analysis, EVs had the second-highest total ownership costs due to depreciation, purchase prices and finance charges. Additionally, consumers have been able to take advantage of tax credits by purchasing EVs, but 12% cited the potential reduction or elimination in tax credits and rebates as a barrier to buying.

Other top concerns identified in this year’s survey were the perceived unsuitability of EVs for long-distance travel (57%), a lack of convenient public charging stations (56%) and fear of running out of charge while driving (55%).

While convenience-store chains continue to add EV chargers to their locations to curb the lack of public charging stations, the pullback on the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Formula Program (NEVI) federal funding is hurting the number of chains that can do so.

“There's not really a business model there to make a large investment without grant funding because it's a large capital investment, and the business volume is just not there right now,” Tom Healy, vice president of facilities development and maintenance at Nouria told CSP in May. The Worcester, Massachusetts-based convenience-store chain has 183 locations, 13 active EV chargers and 26 additional EV chargers expected to be installed by the end of 2025 that have not been affected by the pause on federal funding.

Public chargers cost approximately $3,500 per connector for Level 2 chargers and $38,000 to $90,000 per connector for direct current (DC) fast chargers, with higher costs depending on power output, according to the according to the Department of Energy. That’s not including installation costs, which average around $2,500 per connector.

Other concerns include safety. Twenty-seven percent reported challenges installing charging stations at their residences.

More than 75 EV model options have been introduced in the past four years, AAA said.

Despite advancements in the EV industry and the growing availability of models, public perception regarding the future of EVs remains uncertain. The percentage of U.S. drivers who believe that most cars will be electric within the next ten years has significantly declined from 40% in 2022 to 23% this year, according to AAA's survey.

On the other hand, 16% of U.S. adults report being “very likely” or “likely” to purchase a fully EV as their next car. More than 75 EV model options have been introduced in the past four years, AAA said. The biggest push toward consumer interest in EVs is high gas prices, and in 2022, when gas prices reached $5, 77% of consumers cited that as their top motivation to purchase.

The national average for a gallon of regular ranges from $3 to $3.50, or even higher in depending on the state, according to AAA, but the primary reasons for buying EVs remain similar this year, with respondents citing gas savings, environmental concerns and an appreciation for the lower maintenance costs associated with EVs.

BACKGROUND

In the 118th Congress, Rep. Griffith chaired the House Committee on Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Oversight & Investigations.

In the 119th Congress, Congressman Griffith is serving his first term as chairman of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Environment.

The Environment Subcommittee’s first two hearings of the year focused on the EPA’s regulation of chemical manufacturing and the administration of the Brownfields Program.

Later, Congressman Griffith welcomed Administrator Zeldin for a subcommittee hearing on EPA’s FY26 budget request.

This week, Congressman Griffith held a hearing that examined the impacts of the Clean Air Act.

While these rules are not finalized, the EPA estimates that repeal of the power plant rules would save $19 billion in regulatory costs over two decades beginning in 2026.

Congressman Griffith’s Congressional Review Act (CRA) resolution to repeal a last-minute Biden-Harris regulation on tire manufacturers passed Congress this year. In May, President Trump signed the resolution into law.

This is said to be the largest U.S. LNG offtake by a single buyer to date, and Japan’s largest ever from the United States since the country first imported LNG from Alaska in 1969.
The deal with Cheniere is related to the Corpus Christi LNG facility in Texas and the Sabine Pass LNG facility in Louisiana.
Based on information from JERA, the HOA’s term is more than 20 years, and it will entail up to 1 mtpa of LNG.
Cheniere’s Corpus Christi Liquefaction facility has four fully operational trains with an aggregated nominal production capacity of around 16.5 mtpa of LNG.","Japan’s energy major JERA has finalized multi-year agreements with four U.S. players relating to the purchase of liquefied natural gas (LNG) from the country’s export projects in a bid to fortify Asia’s energy security.

The deals include sales and purchase agreements (SPAs) with NextDecade Corporation and Commonwealth LNG, as well as heads of agreement (HoA) with Sempra Infrastructure and Cheniere Marketing.

The Japanese player says the 20-year agreements are in line with its long-term strategy to build a diversified and resilient LNG procurement portfolio in support of stable, secure energy for Japan and Asia.

Under these, the Japanese major will procure up to 5.5 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) of LNG from the United States. The deals’ total value is said to exceed JERA’s cumulative equity investment in the North American country, which amounts to $6 billion.

This is said to be the largest U.S. LNG offtake by a single buyer to date, and Japan’s largest ever from the United States since the country first imported LNG from Alaska in 1969.

All volumes will be delivered on a free on board (FOB) basis with no destination restrictions. JERA believes this will help it optimize shipping routes and respond flexibly to evolving market conditions and LNG demand across the Asia-Pacific region.

The event announcing the deals was held at the U.S. Department of Energy headquarters in Washington, D.C., on June 12. It was attended by U.S. Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum, Energy Secretary Christopher Wright, and Ambassador of Japan to the United States of America, Shigeo Yamada, among others.

JERA Global CEO and Chair Yukio Kani said: “After more than 15 months of strategic evaluation and commercial engagement, we are pleased to finalize the Agreements with U.S. suppliers, which offer unique flexibility and reliability – essential elements in our diversification strategy.

“These agreements strengthen Japan’s energy security, reaffirm the U.S.’s leading role in the global LNG market, and support long-term sustainable economic development for both countries.”

The SPA with NextDecade, which entails 2 mtpa from Train 5 at the Rio Grande LNG (RGLNG) project, for 20 years, was announced in late May. The deal is subject to a positive final investment decision (FID) being taken on Train 5.

The non-binding HOA with Sempra for 1.5 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) of LNG is tied to the Port Arthur LNG Phase 2 development project in Jefferson County, Texas.

“We are pleased to collaborate with JERA, Japan’s largest power generation company and one of the world’s largest LNG buyers, as they continue to work with the United States to diversify their sources to help strengthen the resilience and dependability of their energy supply,” said Justin Bird, CEO of Sempra Infrastructure.

The U.S. player is targeting a final investment decision (FID) for Port Arthur LNG Phase 2 this year, once the necessary permits and funding, among other things, are secured.

With a nameplate capacity of approximately 13 mtpa, the Trains 1 and 2 forming part of Port Arthur LNG Phase 1 are expected to come online in 2027 and 2028, respectively. The groundbreaking ceremony for Port Arthur LNG Phase 1 was held in March 2024.

As part of Phase 2, Sempra proposes to expand the liquefaction-export project with Trains 3 and 4, which could double the total nameplate capacity of the facility to up to 26 mtpa.

The next deal, an SPA with Commonwealth LNG, encompasses the Japanese player’s purchase of 1 mtpa of LNG for 20 years from the 9.5 mtpa Commonwealth LNG liquefaction and export facility currently under development in Cameron, Louisiana.

“We look forward to our partnership with JERA, a recognized global energy leader who shares our commitment to low-cost energy with the lowest carbon footprint,” said Ben Dell, Managing Partner of Kimmeridge and Chairman of Commonwealth LNG.

The SPA will become fully effective once customary conditions are met, including a positive FID for the project, targeted for Q3 2025. Following this, the first LNG production is expected in 2029. Commonwealth says 4 mtpa from the facility has been booked under long-term agreements.

A 20-year deal with an undisclosed buyer, described as a major Asian energy company, to buy 1 mtpa of LNG for 20 years from the future facility, was announced in early May.

Located on the west bank of the Calcasieu Ship Channel, near Cameron, Louisiana, Commonwealth LNG is set to have five 50,000-cubic-meter (cbm) storage tanks, accommodating vessels up to 216,000 cbm.

The developers expect the facility to unlock approximately $11 billion in total investments in Louisiana and an estimated $3.5 billion in annual export revenue. Furthermore, around 2,000 workers are expected at the peak of construction, providing 275 jobs when the facility begins operations in 2029.

The deal with Cheniere is related to the Corpus Christi LNG facility in Texas and the Sabine Pass LNG facility in Louisiana. Based on information from JERA, the HOA’s term is more than 20 years, and it will entail up to 1 mtpa of LNG.

The six-train Sabine Pass facility, which has been in liquefaction mode since 2016, currently has a 30 mtpa LNG production capacity, processing over 4.7 billion cubic feet per day of natural gas into LNG, which is stored in five tanks.

As part of the Stage 5 expansion project, Cheniere proposes to boost this by adding two large-scale liquefaction trains, each with a nameplate capacity of approximately 7 mtpa and a maximum production capacity of approximately 8.43 mtpa.

Cheniere’s Corpus Christi Liquefaction facility has four fully operational trains with an aggregated nominal production capacity of around 16.5 mtpa of LNG.

The U.S. player plans to expand this by adding seven ​midscale trains that will add more than 10 mtpa of production capacity, bringing CCL’s total permitted capacity to more than 25 mtpa. The first LNG from Train 1 as part of Stage 3 was produced in December 2024, with substantial completion reached in March 2025.

Two additional midscale trains as part of this stage are expected to achieve substantial completion in 2025, and the remaining four in 2026.

Additionally, Cheniere is developing two more midscale trains (Train 8 and 9) with an expected total production capacity of approximately 3 mtpa of LNG next to the CCL Stage 3 project. A positive environmental assessment from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) was received in 2024, and the U.S. player hopes to get all remaining necessary regulatory approvals for the project this year.",https://cdn.offshorewind.biz/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/04/10174305/Commonwealth-LNG-facility-in-Louisiana-1024x576-1.jpg?image-crop-positioner-ts=1744299785,N,,2025-06-12 23:53:56.921408

At issue are clean energy credits that were enacted under the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, known as the IRA, and largely eliminated in the version of the bill that the House passed.

The bill would halt roughly $522 billion in investments approved in the IRA from being spent in communities across the country.

The House bill would roll back incentives for wind, solar and hydrogen power, phase out consumer tax credits for new electric vehicles, and terminate some credits for projects that begin construction more than 60 days after the bill's enactment, among other changes.

Lawmakers from both sides of the aisle say they are fielding calls from advocates and energy industry leaders concerned that without significant changes from the Senate, Americans will face higher energy bills and less jobs.

And the credits are already becoming fodder for political attacks. Groups like Protect Our Jobs, a political action committee spending money advocating for clean energy jobs, is funneling money into ads targeting House Republicans who supported the reconciliation bill.

""I'm a Republican, but now I'm seeing Republicans in Washington try to eliminate jobs like mine,"" says an electrician working in solar energy in one ad.

""How [tax credits] go is important"" says GOP senator looking at House bill

A handful of GOP senators are advocating against a slash and burn approach on the energy credits.

GOP Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, John Curtis of Utah, Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Jerry Moran of Kansas cautioned against a ""full-scale repeal of current credits"" in an April letter to Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D.

""Many American companies have made substantial investments in domestic energy production and infrastructure based on the current energy tax framework,"" they wrote in the letter. ""A wholesale repeal, or termination of certain individual credits, would create uncertainty, jeopardizing capital allocation, long-term project planning, and job creation in the energy sector and across our broader economy.""

In an interview with NPR, Sen. Curtis said he is having good conversations with other Senate Republicans who are ""very receptive"" to his concerns about the House bill.

""I think it's really important that Senate Republicans — and I wish House Republicans — look at this not from the standpoint of 'it's in the IRA, therefore it's bad', but rather what is in the country's best interest and what is the best tax policy and make good, thoughtful decisions,"" Curtis said.

He stressed the need to consider how to support business owners who had been making plans under the IRA.

""One of the worst things that we do to businesses is inconsistency and unpredictability. And therefore, I argue for a kind of appropriate off ramp,"" he said. ""If we're closing these down, let's just do it in a way that takes into account those employees of those businesses, the banks that loaned on those projects and make sure we have business certainty.""

Outside analysts say businesses are already feeling the impact. E2, a nonpartisan, pro-environment business group, has been tracking clean energy project announcements and jobs for over two years. The group's executive director, Bob Keefe, told NPR the market began responding before the House legislation was even written.

""Since January alone, we've seen $14 billion worth of new factories and other projects — clean energy, electric vehicle related plants, solar projects, wind projects, battery projects — $14 billion worth of business investment canceled in America because of the uncertainty over this bill,"" he said.

E2 estimates more than 10,000 announced jobs have been canceled because of concerns over the House bill.

""The House just pulled the rug out from all of those businesses who had been already investing and planning for this by saying that these tax credits were going to get repealed. And so, quite naturally, businesses are pulling back,"" Keefe said, noting the biggest states for clean energy projects are red states. ""If the Senate doesn't fix it, our economy is going to suffer.""

Group of House Republicans also wants changes

Senators aren't only hearing from industry leaders, they're also hearing from Republicans in the House.

""We had some good conversations with a handful of senators and have been having ongoing conversations,"" said Rep. Rob Bresnahan, R-Pa., who wants to see the Senate make adjustments to the House bill he voted for.

""The energy credits are very big for northeastern Pennsylvania,"" he told NPR. ""I'm OK with the phase out, but giving enough runway for projects that have already been committed and pledged to be completed before having the rug ripped out from essentially underneath them.""

Bresnahan is one of 13 Republican House members who sent a letter last week to Senate leadership, urging the chamber to ""substantially and strategically improve our clean energy tax credit provisions"" from the House-passed bill.

The group lists concerns about restrictions of transferability of some credits, the 60-day time limit for enacting projects and other issues.

""This approach jeopardizes ongoing development, discourages long-term investment, and could significantly delay or cancel energy infrastructure projects across the country,"" the letter reads. ""Without a clear signal from Congress encouraging continued investments and offering business certainty as these provisions are phased out, project cancellations will continue to snowball.""

Senate Finance Committee ranking member Ron Wyden, D-Ore., said he's optimistic that progress is being made among his GOP colleagues.

""What I'm doing is going literally senator by senator to those who support innovation or are concerned about not jacking up prices and understand that clean energy helps to create more competition and choice, which is a kind of Republican idea,"" Wyden told NPR.

But changes passed in the Senate would require approval in the House, and any major adjustments could jeopardize the delicate balance of support that allowed GOP leaders to force the bill through last month. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has repeatedly warned senators to tread lightly when it comes to changes in the bill.

Republican lawmakers in Pennsylvania are applauding two Trump administration proposals that opponents say would upend Biden-era rules that aim to reduce climate-warming emissions and toxic air pollutants from power plants, harming human health.

U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin on Wednesday said the proposals aim to bolster President Donald Trump’s goal to “restore American energy dominance.”

Zeldin accused the Biden administration of strangling the power industry and “suffocating” the economy to protect the environment. He argued the EPA’s new rules would save the energy sector more than $1 billion a year, and reduce rate payers’ electricity bills.

“[The Biden administration sought to] make all sorts of industries, including coal and more, disappear — regulate them out of existence,” Zeldin said.

“We will use coal for power generation, to mine for critical minerals, and to export to our allies. Today, we are taking an important step towards putting America back on track.”

The first proposal would repeal a Biden-era rule that aimed to phase out greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel plants. The proposal rejects what is known as the “endangerment finding,” which is the scientific basis for the agency’s authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions. The announcement marks the latest move in a continued effort to roll back former President Joe Biden’s efforts to tackle climate change.

The second proposal would amend the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards, which under the Biden administration became more restrictive.

Known as MATS, the regulation requires plants to reduce emissions of toxic pollutants such as mercury, which is linked to neurological damage among children. Zeldin said the proposal would revert the rules to 2012 standards, which he argues were effective at reducing mercury emissions.

Republican U.S. Rep. Dan Meuser, who represents north central Pennsylvania’s 9th District, said repealing the Biden-era regulations would strengthen energy production in the state.

“Repealing these Biden-era rules will help so many businesses continue to operate, expand, invest, and allow the United States to become truly energy dominant again,” Meuser said.

Republican U.S. Rep. Rob Bresnahan, who represents northeast Pennsylvania’s 8th District, called Biden-era rules a “nail in the coffin” for the state’s energy markets. He said the construction of new natural gas plants would be “virtually impossible” under current Biden environmental regulations.

Both Meuser and Bresnahan represent areas with active natural gas production.

Bresnahan, who has invested in more than 20 fossil fuel companies, pointed to the demand for data centers in Pennsylvania as a reason to provide more support to the power industry.

“Between data centers AI and the growing domestic manufacturing base, the simple fact is we need more electrons on the grid to power all of this.”

The proposals, which will go out for public comment before being finalized, are likely to face legal challenges.

An Associated Press investigation found the Trump administration proposals target environmental rules that could save an estimated 30,000 lives.

The Natural Resources Defense Council said the proposals would impact human health and worsen climate change. The environmental organization threatened legal action if the EPA finalized the rollbacks.

“Power plants are the largest industrial source of carbon emissions, spewing more than 1.5 billion tons of greenhouse gases annually,” the NRDC said in a statement. “The EPA claims this pollution is insignificant – but try telling that to the people who will experience more storms, heat waves, hospitalizations and asthma attacks because of this repeal.”",https://www.witf.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/epa-administrator-lee-zeldin-ap-031225-1620x1080.jpg,N,,2025-06-12 23:37:31.953039

A time traveler visiting from the 1960s might be somewhat disappointed by the state of technological progress in 2025. There are no flying cars, no space hotels, no robot butlers.

But even though they can’t fly, cars are going through a major transformation from loud, jerky, smelly gas guzzlers to sleek electric vehicles (EVs) that quietly hum along roads. Nearly one in five new cars sold in 2023 were electric or plug-in hybrids, according to an International Energy Agency report.

The thing holding back EV adoption right now—besides the relatively high sticker price—is how long it takes to charge the battery, according to industry analyst Sam Adham of the research firm CRU Group.

EVs charge slowly. For some owners, the only practical way to charge is being parked for hours— say, overnight or while they’re at work. That’s very different from the gas and diesel vehicles people are used to, which can be refueled in 5 min or so. The fastest chargers can add enough juice in 15 or 20 min to get someone to their next stop, but that’s not the same as filling up the tank.

For someone living in an apartment building or a dense city neighborhood, without a place they can charge overnight, owning an EV might not be practical if they can’t charge it quickly. Likewise, a delivery company might not be able to justify a fleet of electric vans that have to charge for hours when they could be moving products.

It didn’t used to be this way. “Ten years ago, no one cared about fast charging,” says Venkat Srinivasan, a battery researcher at Argonne National Laboratory. The accepted definition of fast charging has changed in the past decade, he says: 15 min used to be considered fast enough, but car buyers are now demanding 5.

Fast battery charging is also a benefit to the companies that make charging stations. Faster charging means they can sell more energy to more customers in the course of a day. (Many companies also price fast charging higher.)

There’s no ‘perfect’ battery for electric vehicles yet, and honestly, there might never be one single ideal solution.

Chong Yan, battery researcher, Beijing Institute of Technology

Making a battery that charges faster is not simple; it requires understanding the shortcomings of each component down to the molecular level. Nor is it easy to scale up a new battery’s manufacturing to millions of units. Experts agree it’s unlikely that one battery chemistry or technology will emerge to fit every need.

“There’s no ‘perfect’ battery for electric vehicles yet, and honestly, there might never be one single ideal solution,” says Chong Yan, a battery researcher at the Beijing Institute of Technology. “It’s all about trade-offs,” which can include lifespan, safety, environmental impact, and vehicle range and charging time, he says.

In simple terms, a battery consists of two electrodes and a conductive material between them. When a battery is hooked up to a circuit—whether that’s a flashlight bulb or an electric car motor—redox reactions inside the cell move electrons and ions out of one electrode, known as the cathode, and into the other, the anode. In the recharging process, these reactions are reversed.

The cathode hasn’t seen radical changes over the years. Two of the most widely used classes of cathode materials—layered oxides, such as lithium nickel magnesium cobalt oxides (NMC); and polyanion oxides, like lithium iron phosphate oxides (LFP)—are descendants of the ones that John Goodenough, Arumugam Manthiram, and their colleagues developed at the University of Oxford and the University of Texas at Austin decades ago. These cathode materials work relatively quickly.

Getting the lithium ions to dissolve in the electrolyte and cramming them into the anode are significantly slower steps, Srinivasan says.

In addition to those components, rechargeable batteries in EVs require computers. The battery in an EV is not a single pair of electrodes but hundreds or thousands of cells wired together. Usually called a battery management system (BMS), the computer handles the flow of electricity to and from each cell to optimize performance and maintain the safety of the whole battery.

Most of the parts of the battery system are fair game for upgrades, and most of them have been improved since lithium-ion batteries came into production. At the moment, the ubiquitous graphite anode is probably getting the most scrutiny. “Graphite is the bottleneck,” says Ping Liu, a chemical engineer at the University of California San Diego.

Graphite’s layered structure and conductivity, as well as its low cost and toxicity, make it an obvious choice as an electrode material. But its 2D structure limits the paths that lithium ions can travel in and out. Argonne’s Srinivasan likens it to 1,000 people trying to leave a meeting hall through the same set of doors.

One solution could be to add more exits. Researchers at the US Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory have tried drilling holes in graphite as small as 5 µm wide with lasers. These channels give the anode more surface area for ions to enter and exit. In a patent, the researchers reported that they could charge a battery more than three times as fast when using the drilled-out electrode.

Others are looking for different materials. Silicon is a leading candidate. Like graphite, it’s abundant, inexpensive, and poses little health or safety risk.

Batteries made with silicon can theoretically carry more energy in the same volume. Graphite can hold one lithium ion for every six carbon atoms, because the ions intercalate in the hexagonal pores in its sheets. In silicon anodes, the ratio is closer to 1:4.

One glaring problem with silicon is its lack of durability. A pure silicon anode swells in size by more than 300% when populated with lithium ions. A graphite anode, by comparison, grows by about 10% in volume.

Swelling can lead to cracking—not just of the anode but of the battery’s other components, and especially when the anode swells quickly, as happens in a fast-charging battery. That can damage the battery in the short term, but it can also reduce a battery’s overall lifespan, perhaps by years, Srinivasan says. Researchers don’t yet have good real-world data to say with certainty how long batteries with silicon will last. And EV buyers might not want faster charging if it means replacing their battery pack—or their whole car—sooner.

It might be possible to get the best of both worlds using silicon-doped graphite. OneD Battery Sciences, founded in 2013, has developed a catalytic process that grows silicon nanowires inside the pores of graphite particles. The firm is now trying to license the technology to battery makers.

CEO Vincent Pluvinage explains that in OneD’s anodes, both the graphite and the silicon store lithium ions. The ions move about 4.5 times faster into and out of the silicon than they do with graphite, he says, which is what allows faster charging. At the same time, the strength of graphite ameliorates silicon’s swelling problems. Graphite also effectively moves current in and heat out. Heat can contribute to degrading the battery.

OneD opened a pilot plant to make its anode material in Washington state in 2024 and has announced a partnership with Koch Modular Process Systems to build a larger plant, though they haven’t said where or when. But given how long it takes for manufacturers to incorporate new technology into production vehicles, Pluvinage says, it will likely be at least 2030 before these batteries could make it into EVs.

Silicon isn’t the only option. UCSD’s Liu cofounded California-based Tyfast, which is working on a lithium vanadium oxide anode. The start-up received a grant from a US Department of Energy ARPA-E (Advanced Research Projects Agency–Energy) program called EVs4ALL, whose goal is a battery that can charge to 80% capacity in 5 min.

Metal oxide anodes, which several of the program’s grant recipients are exploring, have layers that can open up to let ions in and out more quickly, says EVs4ALL director Halle Cheeseman.

Tyfast’s lithium vanadium oxide batteries have lower energy density than the batteries currently used in EVs—meaning a pack with the same range would weigh more—but they charge very quickly. The company claims that its battery can fully charge in 10 min. Liu’s group attributes the speed to lithium ions rapidly hopping through the anode crystal between tetrahedral LiO4 sites and octahedral LiO6 sites (Nature 2020, DOI: 10.1038/s41586-020-2637-6).

While these bulkier batteries would reduce the range of passenger EVs significantly, Liu says their lower energy density would be less of a drawback in commercial vehicles. Trucks used in mining and other industries are already heavy, so a larger battery pack makes less of a difference.

Another group funded by EVs4ALL is exploring a glassy material. Project leader Anne Co of the Ohio State University would not share details but says the group, which includes collaborators at Honda and Argonne National Lab, has a paper in review. The team’s goal is to make smaller battery packs that have shorter range but charge quickly enough to be convenient.

Co says smaller packs would also help keep the vehicles affordable. But she acknowledges that battery makers outside the US have already beaten her group’s cost targets. It’s a real question if batteries made in the US can be cost-competitive at all, she says.

EVs4ALL is also funding research on sodium- and potassium-ion batteries. Lithium has been the first choice for rechargeable batteries in large part because it is so light. Heavier elements mean heavier battery packs and less range.

Cheeseman says that while both sodium and potassium batteries charge quickly, sodium ones don’t hold enough energy for today’s EVs. But potassium-ion batteries look more promising: they pack more energy than sodium-ion batteries and can charge more quickly than lithium-ion batteries because potassium ions diffuse faster through electrolyte.

Battery makers are also improving charging performance without necessarily introducing new materials. For instance, the Chinese battery company CATL announced last year that it was using an old chemical in its cathodes but processing it in a new way: pressing powdered LFP onto conductive foil rather than binding LFP particles together with adhesives. By making the electrode thinner, CATL reduces the electrical resistance, according to Adham, the industry analyst.

CATL has not disclosed details about the battery, which is called Shenxing Plus, but claims that it can recharge 600 km of range in 10 min at CATL’s proprietary fast-charging stations. That’s 50% more range in the same amount of time than CATL’s last generation of LFP batteries, which the firm announced in 2023.

Other simple ways to speed up battery charging don’t have that much to do with the battery materials themselves. Like most reactions at the lab bench, the reactions that allow lithium ions to move in and out of the electrodes happen faster at higher temperatures. Thus, the battery can charge faster when the battery is hotter—although unwanted side reactions that can degrade batteries also happen faster at higher temperatures.

Tesla enables this higher-temperature charging in a somewhat sneaky way. When a driver pulls up the navigation app to find the closest Tesla fast charger, the BMS computer lets the battery start to heat up more than it would under normal conditions. When the car pulls up to the charger, the warmer battery can be charged faster.

Another seemingly easy solution is to charge batteries at higher voltage, pumping more current into a battery. In March, the car and battery maker BYD announced a new charger that it says can give an EV a range of 400 km after being plugged in for 5 min. The 1,500 V system depends on silicon carbide (SiC) semiconductor chips in the car’s on-board charging system. SiC chips can handle higher temperatures and voltages than chips made with silicon alone.By way of comparison, Tesla’s fastest chargers operate at 1,000 V. BYD is one of many companies using SiC chips; its cars can also preheat their batteries before fast charging.

Using higher voltage does charge batteries faster, but it can also speed up battery degradation. Lithium ions flooded with electrons can convert to lithium metal that deposits on an electrode’s surface. (Although researchers understand the conditions under which this happens, they are still working on understanding exactly why.)

Advertisement

Those deposits are usually irreversible, meaning that less overall lithium and therefore less energy is available to move between the electrodes. And in the worst case, these deposits form spiky structures called dendrites that can pierce the barrier between the cathode and anode and short-circuit the battery.

BYD’s software likely mitigates the damage enough to ensure the battery’s long-term health, according to Adham, the industry analyst. He says the new chargers may be meant primarily as a demonstration of the advantages of BYD’s LFP battery packs and not something most drivers will be using in the near term. Charging at 1,500 V wouldn’t be widely available until new infrastructure was built.

One last battery component that researchers are trying to optimize is the electrolyte solution that ions pass through as the battery charges and discharges. The Beijing Institute’s Yan focuses his energy on perfecting these ion solutions, because solvents can be a bottleneck. During fast charging, if lithium ions can’t move smoothly through a solvent, they create traffic jams and build up just outside the anode.

Lighter cosolvents, such as methyl acetate or ethyl acetate, can improve performance. A 2023 study from Dalhousie University found that using methyl acetate as the solvent for LiPF6—a common salt in electrolyte solutions—had doubled the conductivity of a conventional electrolyte for fast charging (J. Phys. Chem. C. 2020, DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpcc.0c02370).

Argonne’s Srinivasan welcomes these potential improvements in chemistry—some commercially impractical, some incremental, and some more promising. He tries to be realistic about what the path to the 5 min fill-up will be.

Zooming out, he predicts that the solutions will come in three phases: First will be software, such as Tesla’s preheating. Second will be architecture, such as CATL’s pressed LFP powder. The third, which seems not to have arrived quite yet, will be new materials and new chemistry.","https://s7d1.scene7.com/is/image/CENODS/Fast-charging-battery---91662?$responsive$&wid=700&qlt=90,0&resMode=sharp2",N,,2025-06-12 23:30:07.054956

The Congressional Review Act resolutions, passed by Congress in May, aim to overturn California’s ambitious climate regulations, including its rules phasing out gas-powered passenger vehicles, limiting tailpipe emissions from trucks, and restricting nitrogen oxide pollution from medium- and heavy-duty diesel vehicles.

At a White House signing ceremony, Trump denounced California’s regulations as “crazy,” saying, “It’s been a disaster for this country.” He also criticized the cost of EV infrastructure and expressed skepticism about electric vehicle performance, though he added, “I like Tesla,” referencing Elon Musk’s EV company.

California officials responded swiftly. State Attorney General Rob Bonta announced the state’s lawsuit against the federal action during a news conference held before the White House ceremony concluded. “The federal government’s actions are not only unlawful; they’re irrational and wildly partisan,” Bonta said. Ten additional states, all with Democratic attorneys general, joined California in the lawsuit.

The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, which represents major automakers, supported Trump’s action. “Everyone agreed these EV sales mandates were never achievable and wildly unrealistic,” said John Bozzella, the group’s president and CEO, in a statement.

However, California Gov. Gavin Newsom strongly condemned the move, calling it an “all-out assault” on both California and national clean energy goals. “We are suing to stop this latest illegal action by a president who is a wholly-owned subsidiary of big polluters,” Newsom stated.

California has historically held authority under the Clean Air Act to set stricter vehicle emissions standards than federal guidelines through waivers granted by the Environmental Protection Agency. That authority has been a repeated point of contention between California and federal administrations. Trump revoked California’s waiver authority during his first term, but President Joe Biden reinstated it in 2022.

Congressional Republicans used the Congressional Review Act to advance the resolutions, despite a determination from the nonpartisan U.S. Government Accountability Office that California’s rules cannot be legally overturned via that process. The Senate parliamentarian upheld the GAO’s conclusion.

California’s influence extends beyond its borders, as the state represents about 11% of the U.S. car market and has led a coalition of approximately a dozen states adopting similar zero-emission vehicle mandates.

The signing comes amid broader Trump administration efforts to roll back environmental regulations. On June 11, the Environmental Protection Agency proposed repealing limits on greenhouse gas emissions from coal- and natural gas-fueled power plants.

Dan Becker, director at the Center for Biological Diversity, called the signing “Trump’s latest betrayal of democracy,” accusing the administration of “rewarding Big Oil and Big Auto corporations at the expense of everyday people’s health and their wallets.”

Trump, who has made revitalizing domestic auto manufacturing and expanding oil and gas production central to his platform, framed the action as restoring consumer choice. “If you want to buy electric, you can buy electric,” he said. “What this does is it gives us freedom.”

But older Hyundais and most other electric cars still use the Combined Charging System plug and need adapters to connect to Tesla chargers.
In recent years, failure rates at Tesla stations hovered around 2 or 3 percent when only Tesla cars charged there.","Since Tesla installed its first Superchargers in 2012 for the exclusive use of its customers, owners of other electric cars have often felt like second-class citizens. They have wandered in search of electric oases in desolate parking lots, often making desperate calls to help centers after becoming stymied by balky or broken chargers.

It’s no surprise, then, that consumers rank problems with public electric vehicle charging and the time it takes to fuel up as their top two reasons for rejecting electric vehicles, according to J.D. Power.

But help may finally be at hand.

Automakers and charging companies are building new stations and updating their cars to allow drivers to more easily and quickly recharge their vehicles. They are also outfitting charging stations with more amenities like food and bathrooms while making the devices more reliable. And because chargers are only as fast as the cars they connect with, automakers are designing new cars to absorb electricity at Usain Bolt-level speeds. In addition, many automakers have cut deals with Tesla allowing owners of other cars access to the company’s fast-charging network, the largest in the country and widely considered the most reliable.

There is early evidence that efforts to improve electric vehicle charging are paying off.

In recent years, J.D. Power surveys showed that about 20 percent of attempts to charge electric vehicles at all public stations ended in failure because of faulty chargers, long lines or payment glitches. But in the first three months of 2025, overall failure rates fell to 16 percent, the biggest improvement since the surveys began in 2021.

“The industry is finally elevating as a whole,” said Brent Gruber, an executive director at J.D. Power.

The number of chargers has also increased. There were about 55,200 fast chargers in the United States in May, up from 42,200 a year earlier, according to federal data.

In February, a former Phillips 66 gas station in Apex, N.C., near Raleigh, became the first “Rechargery” from Ionna, a company created by eight automakers, including General Motors, Hyundai Motors, BMW and Mercedes-Benz. Their chargers can deliver up to 400 kilowatts of juice, far more than Tesla’s 250-kilowatt Superchargers. Some cars can replenish a battery in 30 minutes or less at the higher charging speeds.

When connected to chargers of 350 kilowatts or more, including those at Ionna and Electrify America, another fast-charging network, a Hyundai Ioniq 5, for example, can fill its electric “tank” from 10 to 80 percent in 18 minutes. That adds up to 220 miles of driving range, enough for more than three hours of highway cruising. That’s quick enough to keep a road trip on schedule, and the family refreshed.

Ionna stations offer 24-hour service. The network has installed lighted canopies over chargers, and drivers can wait in lounges equipped with WiFi, coffee bars and bathrooms while their vehicles are plugged in.

Seth Cutler, Ionna’s chief executive, said the stations seek to transform an experience that many electric drivers dread. Public chargers are sometimes installed in sketchy places, including besides dumpsters in shopping malls and in dingy parking lots with no bathrooms or refreshments nearby.

“Charging an E.V. takes a little time, so this is a place somebody might actually want to be in the middle of the night, and there’s something to do while they’re there,” Mr. Cutler said. “People definitely don’t want to be somewhere that feels unclean or unsafe.”

Ionna aims to install 10 to 12 fast-charging stalls per station. Chargers can connect directly to Teslas and vehicles that use the Combined Charging System plug, which is used by most other automakers. Since February, Ionna has opened 14 stations in several states, and has acquired 200 sites around the country. Its target is to build a total of 30,000 charging bays by 2030.

More cars and charging stations are expected to have plug-and-charge capability in the coming months.

Gas stations and restaurants have also improved their charging game. Buc-ee’s, the Texas-based gas chain that is famous for its sprawling stores and myriad food options, is working with Mercedes to offer “premium” charging that is powered by renewable energy. Waffle House plans to begin installing BP Pulse fast chargers next year. And G.M. and EVgo, a charging company, are building 500 stations with 2,000 stalls at Pilot and Flying J travel centers.

Olabisi Boyle, an Ionna board member and Hyundai’s senior vice president of product and mobility, said her company and other automakers were committed to improving access to charging. Automakers have realized that “E.V. charging wasn’t just a thing you did on the side,” Ms. Boyle said. “It’s the future of the customer experience.”

But that doesn’t mean the complications and problems will easily be dispensed with, especially when it comes to making cars and chargers play nicely with each other.

Nearly every major automaker is redesigning their cars with plug outlets and software that are compatible with Tesla chargers. The North American Charging Standard, developed by Tesla, offers a further advantage of slimmer, lighter handles that are easier to plug into cars, including for seniors or people with disabilities. Hyundai’s Ioniq 5 and Ioniq 9 S.U.V.s are now shipping with those ports from a new factory in Georgia. But older Hyundais and most other electric cars still use the Combined Charging System plug and need adapters to connect to Tesla chargers.

Compatibility issues between cars and chargers that use different charging standards have begun to show up in surveys about how many charging sessions end badly. In recent years, failure rates at Tesla stations hovered around 2 or 3 percent when only Tesla cars charged there.

But since the automaker opened its chargers to cars from other brands, that rate has risen to 7 percent, according to J.D. Power. Mr. Gruber noted that those failure rates included drivers who gave up after encountering lines at chargers. Some Tesla drivers have expressed unhappiness at having to share chargers with other car brands.

Rajiv Diwan, who helped spearhead a charger rollout for the New York Power Authority, called the industry’s coalescing around Tesla’s plug standard “a great move for the American market.” But Mr. Diwan said other charging competitors did not appear to be moving fast enough to build stations to meet rising demand. He said the companies were often hamstrung by onerous construction and electricity costs and bureaucratic delays.

“The industry always sugarcoats things, but charging is still hard for the average person to understand and deal with,” he said. “People just want to get from Point A to Point B with as little fuss as possible, and that’s not happening yet.”

Momentum may also be short-circuited by the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress, who have proposed repealing many federal incentives for electric cars and trucks. The administration has also stopped issuing grants to states to help build chargers under the $5 billion National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Formula Program created during the Biden administration.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/09/multimedia/00biz-ev-charging-qjkp/00biz-ev-charging-qjkp-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-06-12 23:30:10.809549

Addressing urban climate challenges

Urban Forests as Climate Shields, authored by Ava G Halstead, Joaquin D Rodriguez Alvarez, and Michael Lake, outlines the growing evidence that tree canopies serve as cost-effective, multi-functional solutions to some of the most pressing urban climate challenges.

The authors argue for a systemic reframing of urban forestry within city planning and policy. Moving beyond aesthetics, they propose urban forests be treated as a climate adaptation priority, requiring integrated governance, long-term funding, and data-driven implementation.

Drawing on global case studies and supported by Leading Cities’ QBE AcceliCITY programme – recognised as one of the top three govtech accelerators globally – the article explores the role of urban forestry in reducing heat island effects, managing stormwater, improving air quality, and enhancing the social and ecological resilience of cities.

Diana Furchtgott-Roth, director of the Center for Energy, Climate and Environment and the Herbert and Joyce Morgan Fellow at The Heritage Foundation, and one of America’s most prominent energy experts, said:

“Energy cooperation between Canada, Mexico and the United States is vital for the Western World’s energy security. Both President Trump and Prime Minister Carney share energy as a key priority for their respective administrations.

“The G7 should embrace energy abundance by cooperating and committing to a rapid expansion of energy infrastructure. Members should commit to streamlined permitting, including a one-stop shop permitting and environmental review process, to unleash the capital investment necessary to make energy abundance a reality.”

North America’s energy industry is continentally integrated, benefitting from a blend of U.S. light crude oil and Mexican and Canadian heavy crude oil that keeps the continent’s refineries running smoothly.

Daniel Dufort, president and CEO of MEI, weighed in:

“The abundance and complementary of Canada and the United States’ energy resources have made both nations more prosperous and more secure in their supply. Both countries stand to reduce dependence on Chinese and Russian energy by expanding their pipeline networks – the United States to the East and Canada to the West – to supply their European and Asian allies in an increasingly turbulent world.”

Each day, Canada exports 2.8 million barrels of oil to the United States. These get refined into gasoline, diesel and other higher value-added products that furnish the U.S. market with reliable and affordable energy, as well as exported to other countries, including some 780,000 barrels per day of finished products that get exported to Canada and 1.08 million barrels per day to Mexico.

A similar situation occurs with natural gas, where Canada ships 8.7 billion cubic feet of natural gas per day to the United States through a continental network of pipelines. This gets consumed by U.S. households, as well as transformed into liquefied natural gas products, of which the United States exports 11.5 billion cubic feet per day, mostly from ports in Louisiana, Texas and Maryland.

Under this scenario, Europe would buy more high-value light oil from the U.S., whose domestic needs would be back-stopped by lower-priced heavy oil imports from Canada, whereas Asia would consume more LNG from Canada, diminishing China and Russia’s economic and strategic leverage over the continent.",https://www.heritage.org/themes/heritage/src/images/bell.png,N,,2025-06-12 23:53:59.298895

While taking those actions, Mr. Trump has declared dubious national emergencies to invoke powers rarely sought by his predecessors.

Since the start of the Trump administration, FEMA has lost about a quarter of its full-time staff, according to a former senior official.","The Senate passed bipartisan legislation last year to substantially broaden the scope of that law — called the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act, or RECA — beyond Cold War-era victims to cover others who have been harmed by the aftereffects in the decades since.

But after Republican leaders refused to allow it to come to a vote on the House floor, the law expired, dashing hopes of compensation for sickened civilians.

Senate Republican leaders are now, at the behest of Mr. Hawley, giving the measure another shot at passage, including it in the Senate version of the domestic policy bill that they are hoping to pass in weeks. He is considered a key vote on the bill because he opposes several provisions floated by his party for cutting Medicaid.

“I think about, in the St. Louis area alone, how many folks I’ve talked to whose grandfathers or grandmothers were involved with the radiation project and whose families have subsequently had cancer in the family for generations,” Mr. Hawley said in an interview. “And they’re very proud of their service to the nation, but they would like to be thanked for that and be treated appropriately and not lied to anymore by their government.”

The measure would revive the law and authorize its compensation fund to run for another two years. It would also expand eligibility to include civilians in the swaths of New Mexico, Utah and Arizona that were previously excluded from benefits coverage. And it would for the first time allow residents in Missouri, Tennessee, Kentucky and Alaska — sites where workers processed uranium for the nation’s nuclear program — who were exposed to nuclear contamination to be eligible for benefits.

Mr. Hawley’s involvement in the issue stems from St. Louis’s history with the atomic bomb. Scientists first began churning out uranium for the Manhattan Project in 1942 at the Mallinckrodt Chemical Works factory there.

But over the next several decades, hundreds of thousands of tons of radioactive waste stored in open steel drums were hauled and dumped across the city. The waste seeped into the city’s soil, including on land that later became ball fields, and into Coldwater Creek, a tributary that snakes through the metropolitan area for 19 miles through backyards and public parks. Rare cancers, autoimmune diseases and other mysterious illnesses have since spread through the community.

Lawmakers like Mr. Hawley have maintained that the government should help foot residents’ health care bills.

Asked whether the inclusion of the measure might encourage him to support his party’s domestic policy bill despite his concerns about the legislation’s Medicaid provisions, Mr. Hawley suggested that it could.

“This will really dramatically increase the availability of health care for people in my state,” he said. “If you are a RECA claimant, if you are a nuclear radiation survivor, then you’re going to get a lot of help with your medical bills here. So what this is going to mean, practically in Missouri, is a lot of people are going to get a lot more access to health care, which is really, really important.”

Mr. Hawley continued: “So, I still have concerns about Medicaid, and believe me, I’m talking about those on an almost hourly basis now with my leadership. But this is a big, big deal, and not just for my state. This is going to be a big deal for a lot of people, and it’s going to help a lot of people get health care.”

In its statement announcing the withdrawal, the White House made no mention of the affected tribes and portrayed the issue falsely as revolving around “speculative climate change concerns.”

The tribes had called for the dams to be breached as a way to restore the salmon population, a proposal that has faced intense pushback because of the potential costs. A study found that removing the four dams was the most promising approach to restoring the salmon population, but also reported that replacing the electricity generated by the dams, shipping routes and irrigation water would cost between $10.3 billion and $27.2 billion.

The 2023 agreement from the Biden administration, a memorandum of understanding with the tribes that brokered a 10-year truce in the legal battles, committed $300 million to Washington, Oregon and the tribes to restore the wild salmon population. The Biden administration allocated another $60 million to the effort last year.

But the Biden administration did not take a position on the most contentious proposal of breaching the dams. The agreement called for additional study of the proposal and committed to supporting clean energy projects that could replace the power generated by the dams. However, the Biden White House noted in a statement that any decision and authority to breach the dams “resides with Congress.”

In a statement explaining the withdrawal, the Trump White House characterized the agreement, and other executive actions by the Biden administration, as opening the door to breaching the dams. The Trump administration argued in effect that the agreement resulted in significant amounts of money being spent to ultimately close down the hydroelectric dams — as well as other adverse effects noted in studies of the proposal.

Tribal leaders and Democratic lawmakers in the Pacific Northwest immediately denounced the withdrawal, while Senator Jim Risch, Republican of Idaho and a longtime opponent of the effort to breach the dams, praised Mr. Trump’s decision in a statement as “a return to sound science and common-sense.”

Senator Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington, said in a statement that the deal between the tribes and the federal government “was the result of years of painstaking work” and that “the Trump administration’s senseless decision to tear it up is a betrayal of our tribes and a tremendous setback for the entire Northwest.”

Gerald Lewis, the chairman of the tribal council of the Yakama Nation, said in a statement that his tribe was “deeply disappointed” by the decision, adding that the termination of the agreement also cancels the Biden administration’s investment in tribal energy projects.

“The administration’s decision to terminate these commitments,” Mr. Lewis said, “echoes the federal government’s historic pattern of broken promises to tribes, and is contrary to President Trump’s stated commitment to domestic energy development.”

Shannon Wheeler, chairman of the Nez Perce Tribe, did not directly criticize Mr. Trump, saying instead in a statement that the agreement was “a vision for preventing salmon extinction” in the Columbia River Basin and that “it is a vision we believe is supported, publicly or privately, by most people in the Northwest.”

Fish populations in the region have fallen sharply since 15 tribes from the Columbia River Basin entered into legally binding treaties with the United States in the mid-19th century. Those treaties reserved sovereign and inherent rights, including the right to fish at traditional locations, on and off reservation lands, and to protect fish at those locations.

While many products have become subject to higher import taxes since Mr. Trump began implementing his aggressive trade policy, Thursday’s announcement marked one of the first times this year that everyday consumer goods were specifically targeted. The result will also apply to imported dishwashers, dryers, stoves and food waste disposals, and could translate into higher costs for American households.

Thursday’s move came one week after the Trump administration doubled tariffs on steel and aluminum products — and it follows wave after wave of similar moves that have targeted cars, auto parts and other goods from many of America’s trading partners. The government said that the action was necessary to address “trade practices that undermine national security.” The new tariffs are meant to shield American-made appliances that are made with steel from cheaper foreign-made products.

Internal Error

The higher metal levies have already rankled close allies that sell to the United States, including Canada, Mexico and Europe. They have also sent alarms to automakers, plane manufacturers, home builders, oil drillers and other companies that rely on buying metals.

They are beginning to ripple across supply chains.

Companies that use steel and aluminum to manufacture products like washing machines and dishwashers in the United States have had to pay higher costs for the steel and aluminum they purchase. That, in turn, makes their products more expensive — and less competitive with appliances made in other countries, where manufacturers may not be subject to the same tariffs.

So the Trump administration created what it called an “inclusion” process to allow U.S. manufacturers that use steel and aluminum in their factories to petition to have tariffs applied to their foreign competitors’ goods as well. Those tariffs will in theory help protect U.S. appliance manufacturers against foreign factories that can purchase steel and aluminum more cheaply, and therefore sell their goods at lower prices.

Despite Mr. Trump’s tariffs, measures of inflation have so far remained muted. Price increases were relatively stable last month, government data showed on Wednesday, and the costs of appliances in particular have increased more slowly than overall inflation did last month.

Economists caution, however, that the growing list of tariffs could begin to push up prices more noticeably later this year.

Mr. Trump’s economic advisers have tried to downplay the economic toll their trade actions take on American consumers.

At a Senate hearing on Thursday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent noted that many companies are opting against passing the costs of tariffs onto their consumers and said that inflation remains under control.

“Inflation in the U.S. is at its slowest pace since 2021 on decelerating cost increases for shelter, food, and energy,” Mr. Bessent said. “After four years of price increases diminishing the U.S. standard of living, inflation is showing substantial improvement due to the administration’s policies.”

In his first term, Mr. Trump imposed tariffs on foreign-made washing machines in a bid to bolster domestic manufacturers. Economic research found those tariffs encouraged companies to shift more manufacturing into the United States, but at very steep cost to consumers: About 1,800 new jobs were created, but consumers paid, in total, about $817,000 per job.

And the tariffs drove up not just the cost of washing machines, but also dryers — which were not subject to tariffs, but are often purchased together.

Economic studies of the steel tariffs from Mr. Trump’s first term have come to similar conclusions, finding that the levies stimulated the domestic industry but also at significant costs. An analysis published in 2023 by the U.S. International Trade Commission, an independent, bipartisan agency, found that the metal tariffs encouraged buyers of steel and aluminum to purchase more from American sources, and expanded U.S. steel and aluminum production by about $2.25 billion in 2021.

But they raised production costs for firms making automobiles, tools and industrial machinery, which use large amounts of metal in their manufacturing. That shrank production in those and other downstream industries by about $3.48 billion in 2021, more than offsetting the gains to metal makers.

“Our great Farmers and people in the Hotel and Leisure business have been stating that our very aggressive policy on immigration is taking very good, long time workers away from them, with those jobs being almost impossible to replace,” he said. Mr. Trump for decades has owned luxury hotels, an industry with a strong immigrant labor force.

Mr. Trump then blamed the Biden administration for allowing “criminals” to apply for jobs on farms. “We must protect our Farmers, but get the CRIMINALS OUT OF THE USA.”

Later, at a news conference, he took an uncharacteristically sympathetic tone toward immigrants who work on farms and in the hospitality industry.

“Our farmers are being hurt badly by, you know, they have very good workers, they have worked for them for 20 years,” he said. “They’re not citizens, but they’ve turned out to be, you know, great. And we’re going to have to do something about that. We can’t take farmers and take all their people and send them back because they don’t have maybe what they’re supposed to have, maybe not.”

He later said that there would be an “order” soon on the matter.

“We can’t do that to our farmers and leisure, too, hotels,” he said. “We’re going to have to use a lot of common sense on that.”

The comments came as the Trump administration was accelerating its crackdown on immigration with a focus on workplaces with undocumented workers, such as farms, restaurants and construction sites. Last Friday, immigration raids in Los Angeles’s garment district set off protests that have spread to cities across the country.

Brian Kovak, an economics and public policy professor at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, wrote in an email in April that deporting large groups of undocumented immigrants would cause a shock to major industries.

“It takes time and resources to recruit workers from other locations or occupations, and firms may need to raise wages and benefits to attract them, which will likely lead to higher prices for US consumers,” he wrote. “President Trump’s statements suggest that he is aware of this likely disruption and hopes to mitigate it.”

Mr. Trump made similar comments about farmers during a cabinet meeting in April.

“If they have strong recommendations for their farms, for certain people, we’re going to let them stay in for a while,” he said at the time. “Work with the farmers, and then come back and go through a process, a legal process, but we have to take care of our farmers.”

Leticia M. Saucedo, co-director of the Labor and Community Center of the Greater Capital Region at U.C. Davis School of Law, said in April that the government has long listened to complaints from the agricultural industry and tailored policy as a result.

In the past, she said, “the federal government has heeded the requests of growers and other employers to exempt their workers from restrictive immigration policies,” including a program in the 1940s that allowed Mexican farmworkers to enter the United States for more than two decades.

Mr. Trump’s softer tone did not last long. By Thursday afternoon, he was back to celebrating his immigration crackdown.

“I campaigned on, and received a Historic Mandate for, the largest Mass Deportation Program in American History,” he wrote. “Polling shows overwhelming Public Support for getting the Illegals out, and that is exactly what we will do.”

He continued, “A king would say ‘I’m not going to get this.’ A king wouldn’t even have the California mandate to even be talking,” referring to the joint resolutions of Congress that he had just signed blocking California’s effort to phase out gasoline-powered vehicles.

“No, no. We’re not a king,” Mr. Trump said. “We’re not a king at all, thank you very much.”

In February, Mr. Trump likened himself to a king in another fight with Democrats in a blue state. As Mr. Trump sought to end congestion pricing for vehicles in New York City, the president declared on social media “CONGESTION PRICING IS DEAD. Manhattan, and all of New York, is SAVED. LONG LIVE THE KING!”

The official White House account on X, the social media website, amplified the message with an illustration of Mr. Trump wearing a crown. A federal judge later blocked Mr. Trump from attempting to end congestion pricing while the courts weighed in — demonstrating one of the constitutional checks to presidential power.

Mr. Trump’s effort to distance himself from his own suggestions of royal prerogative come as he has plowed forward with a maximalist view of presidential power in his second term, and has at times hosted official White House events that featured royal flourishes and monarchical claims to religious legitimacy.

He has issued sweeping pardons to rioters convicted of violent crimes that occurred during the storming of the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, in addition to many other pardons of political allies who had been convicted of felonies.

He has also issued more than 150 executive orders, some of which attempted actions that courts ultimately found beyond his power. He has purged the government of officials perceived as his political enemies — and bragged about it to his supporters. He has run roughshod over federal agencies in ways that judges have said exceed his authority and frozen funds that Congress had already appropriated. While taking those actions, Mr. Trump has declared dubious national emergencies to invoke powers rarely sought by his predecessors.

And Mr. Trump has attacked and sought to undermine the counterweights to his own authority in government, actions that critics have particularly focused on when accusing Mr. Trump of pursuing an autocratic or monarchical style of power.

He has relentlessly attacked judges who have ruled against him, sidelined Congress’s role in making decisions about taxes and spending, steamrolled internal limits on the executive branch and used the levers of government to try to force outside centers of power like law firms and universities to submit to his will.

And the military parade scheduled for Saturday is the latest example of Mr. Trump’s desire to flex military might in openly political displays and surround himself in the pageantry of the armed forces. On Tuesday, Mr. Trump said that any protesters who assembled during the parade would be met with “very big force,” making no distinction between violent confrontations and constitutionally protected peaceful demonstrations.

The organizers of the “No Kings” marches have said that they intentionally had not scheduled demonstrations in Washington, D.C., on Saturday to order to avoid the military parade, instead encouraging demonstrators in the area to join their flagship march in Philadelphia.

His resignation came after other senior staff members have left and a day after President Trump said he would wind down the federal agency by November.

“We want to wean off of FEMA and we want to bring it down to the state level,” Mr. Trump said on Tuesday during a news briefing in the Oval Office. “We think after the hurricane season we’ll start phasing it out.”

Mr. Trump also warned states to expect “less money” from the federal government for disaster recovery. And, he said, the money would come directly from the president’s office.

That would be a substantial change from the current system, under which FEMA vets applications from states, localities and individuals for grants and direct payments to recover from disasters.

If a state gets hit by a hurricane or other extreme weather, “the governor should be able to handle it,” Mr. Trump said. “And frankly, if they can’t handle it, the aftermath, then maybe they shouldn’t be governor.”

The National Response Coordination Center is considered FEMA’s 24-hour war room, where planning for responses to disasters occurs. It coordinates the federal, state and local responses, handling things like the deployment of search and rescue teams, assisting hospitals that have to evacuate, and shipping food and water to emergency sites.

The center’s management is particularly critical now during Atlantic hurricane season, which began June 1 and is expected to be above average, with a prediction of 17 named storms. Summer and fall are the most challenging seasons for FEMA because of hurricanes, wildfires and other threats.

Mr. Greenberg, who gave two weeks’ notice, did not respond to a request for comment. The FEMA media office issued a statement saying it “recognizes the departure of several employees who have played a part in the operation of FEMA under its former focus,” but did not mention Mr. Greenberg by name.

The statement said the agency has “the right leadership in place to remain focused on our mission” and that FEMA is “fully prepared for Hurricane season.”

Mr. Greenberg’s resignation was first reported by CBS News.

FEMA deploys staff members to disaster areas across the country to support recovery efforts. But in recent months, agency employees, as well as the state and local authorities, have expressed concerns that staff reductions are already endangering the government’s ability to do its job.

Since the start of the Trump administration, FEMA has lost about a quarter of its full-time staff, according to a former senior official. Last month, the head of FEMA was dismissed, and several senior officials have left, including MaryAnn Tierney, who was second-in-command.

“I will not be complicit in the dismantling of this agency, and while I would implement change — even radical change — the current approach lacks a clear end state or plan, and has been done recklessly without regard to our current statutory or moral obligations to the American people,” Ms. Tierney wrote in a recent message to agency staff that was shared with The New York Times.

The departures came after pressure from the Department of Government Efficiency, previously led by Elon Musk, for large-scale forced resignations of federal workers.

The cuts have meant fewer meteorologists at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which critics fear could lead to less accurate forecasts; and the loss of one-fifth of the coordinating officers at FEMA, who manage responses to major disasters.

It has also meant delays and other problems for states hit by disasters, with some waiting as long as two months for FEMA to approve requests to declare a disaster.

Senator Martin Heinrich, Democrat of New Mexico, said in an interview he did not believe the Trump administration had any sort of plan when it comes to FEMA.

“It’s clear that states are on their own now,” Mr. Heinrich said. “I don’t think there’s much capacity at FEMA right now, and that concerns me greatly. It’s one thing to say ‘We need to do things a much better way.’ But what they’re saying is ‘If you get hit by a hurricane, or a tornado or a wildfire, you’re on your own.’”

Several experts said Mr. Trump’s warning about changes to disaster aid would entrench the politicization of disaster aid. Already, Mr. Trump has openly threatened to withhold disaster relief to states led by political rivals, such as California.

Andrew Morris, a historian at Union College in New York who studies disaster relief and social safety nets, said politics had always played a part disaster relief.

“But the sense that there is a partisan test to whether or not you get disaster relief, and the possibility of denying disaster relief on whether or not you’re aligned with the president’s agenda, that’s something that’s new and definitely troublesome,” Dr. Morris said.

Mr. Trump has established the FEMA Review Council, which Kristi Noem, the secretary of the Department Homeland Security is leading along with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth.

The council is expected to submit recommendations in the coming months about “reforms and what FEMA will look like in the future as a different agency,” Ms. Noem said at the Oval Office briefing.

She argued the changes would “empower governors to go out and respond” to emergencies. FEMA, she said, “has failed thousands, if not millions, of people, and President Trump does not want to see that continue into the future.”

States already bear significant costs when it comes to disaster recovery. FEMA’s traditional role has been to provide additional support and resources to states when disasters exceed their capacity.

In this case, though, the administration went through normal channels and asked Congress to go along with its efforts to redirect federal money from programs that have historically drawn substantial bipartisan support. The bulk of the funds targeted — $8.3 billion — is for foreign assistance programs. The remaining $1.1 billion is for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which funds NPR and PBS.

“America’s resources should always serve America’s interests,” said Representative Warren Davidson, Republican of Ohio. “The reality is the radical left has seized these institutions and wielded them for an agenda that doesn’t serve America’s interests.”

Four House Republicans joined Democrats in opposing the measure, which passed only after Speaker Mike Johnson pressed a handful of G.O.P. lawmakers who had initially voted “no” to support it. Those who broke with their party in opposition were Representatives Mark Amodei of Nevada, Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania, Nicole Malliotakis of New York and Mike Turner of Ohio.

At least one Republican who initially voted “no” but changed his vote, Representative Nick LaLota of New York, suggested he did so after winning a concession from Mr. Johnson on SALT deductions — state and local taxes that can be written off on federal returns — a key issue in Republicans’ domestic policy bill.

He said he left a conversation with the speaker on the House floor with “expectations that my constituents will get what they need.”

The proposal’s fate in the Senate is unclear. Republicans can approve the clawbacks with a simple majority vote, but some senators have expressed a range of concerns about taking back money from programs they support, including for public broadcasting and the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, the global health program that President George W. Bush started and is credited with saving more than 25 million lives worldwide.

Even in the House, where Republicans tend to skew more conservative than their colleagues in the Senate and defer more to Mr. Trump, several conservatives had openly fretted about taking back the money. On Thursday, minutes before some Republican lawmakers switched their votes, it appeared that the measure would fail.

“Our local stations are dedicated to serving their communities, but their ability to continue offering free, high-quality programming would be eliminated if the federal funding is rescinded,” Mr. Amodei said in the days leading up to the vote. “Rescinding this funding also would isolate rural communities, jeopardizing their access to vital resources they depend on.”

If approved by the Senate, the rollbacks to public broadcasting would affect more than 1,500 public media stations, as well as the corporation’s public radio satellite system, which enables national emergency alerts.

Democrats assailed the package.

“We’re on the floor of the House of Representatives, not debating legislation that is designed to make this country and our economy more affordable, but actually debating legislation that targets Elmo and Big Bird and Daniel Tiger and ‘Sesame Street,’” Representative Hakeem Jeffries of New York, the Democratic leader, said on the House floor, brandishing a small Elmo plushie.

The $9.4 billion package the White House put forward amounts to a minuscule portion of the overall federal funds Congress controls.

But Republicans’ initial reluctance to approve the package, which administration officials had narrowed in an effort to avoid a failed vote, foreshadowed a difficult path ahead for any other spending reductions they might be asked to approve. The last time a Trump administration asked lawmakers to pull back federal funds they had already approved, during Mr. Trump’s first term, the effort failed after two Republican senators joined Democrats to defeat what had been a largely symbolic effort.

White House officials envision the $9.4 billion package as the opening salvo and want to send more cuts for lawmakers to codify.

“It’s very clear that this is an opening shot,” Representative Chip Roy, Republican of Texas, said of the package. “We’ll see if Congress can step up to the plate.”

Senators from states reliant on the program worry that the changes the House pushed through — particularly one that would have states assume some of the cost of assistance payments currently paid entirely by the federal government — will punt huge costs onto their states. And they worry that the changes could also result in the loss of free school meals for young low-income children.

It is yet another policy dispute between the two chambers that could complicate efforts to ultimately pass a final, compromise version of Republicans’ marquee legislation. Hard-liners in the House have said that they only reluctantly voted to pass what Mr. Trump refers to as his ”big, beautiful bill” and will not support legislation with fewer spending reductions.

But in the Senate, where Republicans represent entire states, not districts, the SNAP provisions have prompted alarm.

The two senators from West Virginia, Jim Justice and Shelley Moore Capito — both Republicans — have expressed concerns about how the House provisions will hit their state, where one in six residents receive food assistance through the program. Their governor, Patrick Morrisey, also opposes the plan.

Mr. Justice, the state’s former governor, has argued that Republicans can strike a better balance.

“We can’t cut to the bone and hurt people,” he said in a brief interview. “It’s legitimate to have concerns about what impact this will have in your state.”

“They’re in real need,” Mr. Justice said of his constituents. “That being said, I really believe that our states are going to have to be able to step up some, too. Now, we’ve got to watch — we just can’t overload our states too much.”

Senator Tommy Tuberville of Alabama, who is running to be the state’s governor, told The Hill that states like his would “have a tough time picking up the bill on that.”

The measure approved by the House proposes to push some of the costs for the food aid program to the states. All states would be required to pay at least 5 percent of the benefit costs. They would have to pay more if they reported a certain error rate — the rate at which state agencies mistakenly underpay or overpay SNAP recipients.

States with an error rate of 6 percent or higher would need to foot the bill for between 15 percent and 25 percent. The average error rate in 2023, according to the Department of Agriculture, which oversees the program, was 11.68 percent.

“What this is going to force states to do is raise state taxes or cut food to hungry people,” said Joel Berg, the chief executive of Hunger Free America, a hunger and food security nonprofit group. “It’s not like Republican-run states want to take on more of these expenses. So it’s no shock that Republican senators are saying, ‘Hold on, are you really going to burden our states?’”

That helps explain why the Senate Agriculture Committee, which is in charge of writing the portion of the sprawling legislation dealing with nutrition assistance, has proposed to soften those provisions. In its proposal released on Wednesday night, states with an error rate below 6 percent would not have to pay any costs. States with higher error rates would pay for between 5 percent and 15 percent of the costs, a lower share than set forward by the House proposal.

“A lot of people were concerned about the significant bill to the states,” said Senator John Boozman, Republican of Arkansas and the chairman of the Agriculture Committee. “This was an effort — it’s the best of both worlds.”

Democrats contend that the modifications do not go far enough.

“While some changes were made to the food assistance cuts, this bill continues to include an unprecedented cost shift, forcing tens of billions of SNAP costs onto state governments for the first time,” said Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, the top Democrat on the Agriculture Committee. “Because nearly every state has balanced budget rules, states will almost certainly have to cut SNAP eligibility, benefits or both, or choose between food assistance and other critical needs, like education, health and public safety.”

Some G.O.P. senators were also uncomfortable with a provision in the House-passed bill that would expand SNAP’s existing work requirements to cover food stamp recipients up to age 64, including those with children who are at least age 7. That would be a significant expansion of existing law, which currently requires only beneficiaries up to age 54 to work in exchange for SNAP, and excludes those with dependents.

Senators have privately worried that those changes will result in the loss of free school lunches for low-income children. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the changes could result in 420,000 children losing school nutrition benefits in an average month — either by being bumped from free lunch to reduced-price lunch, or losing access to school meals entirely.

Children who receive food assistance are automatically enrolled in school nutrition programs, and would need to apply separately if their family lost access to SNAP. Schools in poor neighborhoods also provide universal lunches to all schoolchildren if enough families are eligible for SNAP. If numbers fell below those thresholds, individual families would instead need to apply.

The version of the legislation that the Senate Agriculture Committee released on Wednesday would also change that provision, instead introducing work requirements for adults with dependents who are at least 10 years of age or older.

Mr. Trump said that an attack was likely to destroy the chances for a diplomatic solution. “I think it would blow it,” he said, before arguing the other side of the equation, saying it “might help it actually, but it also could blow it.”

His statement came just hours after the administration announced that Steve Witkoff, Mr. Trump’s special envoy to the Middle East, planned to meet the Iranian foreign minister in Oman on Sunday for another negotiating session.

The somewhat contradictory signals from the White House came amid growing signs that Israel was preparing for a strike of unknown proportions against Iranian sites. Mr. Trump refused to give details of a conversation he held on Monday with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, or to say whether, in that conversation, he had offered any kind of go-ahead to the Israeli leader to proceed with a strike. In recent weeks, Mr. Trump has said that he has urged Mr. Netanyahu to hold off on any military action while negotiations were underway.

Nonetheless, when asked on Thursday if an attack could happen very soon, he said: “I don’t want to say imminent, but it looks like it’s something that could very well happen.” Several hours later, in a social media post, he wrote that the administration was “committed to a Diplomatic Resolution of the Iran Nuclear issue.”

Mr. Trump’s statements left American and European intelligence officials searching for any signs that Israel was getting ready, including evidence that it was massing the aircraft and missiles that would be needed for any sustained assault on Iran’s remaining air defenses, its missile stores and its nuclear sites.

But there was also speculation among many officials that Israel and the United States may be engaged in coercive diplomacy. If Mr. Witkoff’s meeting goes ahead, officials said, his message to Iran would most likely be a simple one: Tehran will lose its ability to enrich uranium one way or the other, either in a negotiated settlement that would gradually turn the making of fuel over to a multination consortium operating outside of Iran, or through an Israeli strike.

Hours before Mr. Trump spoke, the board of the International Atomic Energy Agency, the United Nations body that inspects nuclear programs to assure there is no diversion of fuel for weapons use, condemned Iran in a resolution for failing to answer questions about possible past military nuclear activity at several sites around the country. In response, Iranian officials vowed to produce even more near-bomb-grade uranium and to open a third nuclear enrichment site, deep underground.

“The process to equip the machines will begin, and once it is completed, we will begin enrichment,” Mohammad Eslami, the leader of Iran’s Atomic Energy Agency, declared after the vote on the resolution.

He did not say where the new underground site was. But intelligence officials and outside experts said they assumed he was referring to a site south of Iran’s long-existing enrichment facility in Natanz, where satellite imagery has documented the digging of new tunnels. American and Israeli intelligence officials have believed that was Tehran’s newest and biggest effort to construct nuclear facilities that were so deep in the mountains that they could withstand bunker-busting bombs, sabotage efforts on the ground, and cyberattacks.

Mr. Eslami also said that Iran was replacing a generation of old centrifuges in another underground site, called Fordow, with new nuclear centrifuges that can enrich uranium far more efficiently. “They are constantly threatening us; they must know that our nuclear industry is now part of Iranian lives,” he said.

But just as important is what Iran did not say or do on Thursday. It did not declare that it was withdrawing from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, which bars it from building nuclear weapons. (Israel, which is believed to possess about 100 nuclear weapons, has never signed the treaty, nor have India and Pakistan. North Korea withdrew two decades ago.) No inspectors were expelled or more cameras turned off, officials said.

In recent days, Iran has rejected the Trump administration’s central demand: that its vast infrastructure for enriching uranium, one of two pathways to building a nuclear weapon, must be shut down and ultimately dismantled. Under a proposal Mr. Witkoff sent to his Iranian counterparts two weeks ago, the country would be able to make that transition slowly, continuing to produce fuel until the international consortium was ready to take its place. That could take upward of a decade, some nuclear experts say.

Mr. Netanyahu, with his shaky governing coalition showing new signs of unraveling, has made it clear he has little interest in such solutions. Three times over the past decade or so, he has gone to the edge of ordering military strikes on Iran’s nuclear facilities, only to pull back at the last moment. In recent days, he has shown every sign of being eager to pull the trigger, even if it risks Mr. Trump’s wrath.

The signs of preparation in the Middle East were everywhere, but they also seemed to lack an air of urgency.

The 40,000 U.S. military personnel in the Persian Gulf and broader region were on higher alert Thursday amid reports of a possible imminent strike, and the inevitable retaliation that would follow.

At bases around the region, U.S. troops were conducting “bunker dive” drills — essentially air raid drills should U.S. bases come under retaliatory Iranian fire. Military planners were weighing how and when to move some military aircraft out of the immediate area, to reduce the chance of being attacked.

In Iraq, where Iranian influence is strong, some diplomats were withdrawn, “nonessential personnel” at the embassy were preparing to leave, and U.S. forces authorized the voluntary departure of dependents, mostly Navy and Marine families in Bahrain. But if commanders had thought an attack was truly imminent, several officials said, they probably would have ordered a mandatory evacuation.

Pentagon officials reported they have made no major changes to U.S. forces in recent days. The aircraft carrier Carl Vinson, with 60 aircraft, including F-35 fighters, currently in the Arabian Sea, appeared to be staying in its position. The United States also has several dozen attack and fighter jets deployed around the Gulf region and Middle East. Those aircraft were used extensively in the defense of Israel during the two Iranian missile strikes last year, which failed to do much damage.

But in Jerusalem, the U.S. Embassy restricted the movement of employees on Thursday, in a directive to employees and their families that reflected growing concern about potential Iranian retaliation should Israel proceed with a strike. The restrictions bar travel outside the greater Tel Aviv area, Jerusalem and Beersheba, with some exceptions, the embassy said on its website.

The U.S. ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, told an Israeli news outlet this week that he did not believe it was “likely” that Israel would strike Iran without receiving a “green light” from the Trump administration.

The office of Mr. Netanyahu of Israel did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday about the possibility of an Israeli attack on Iran. The Israeli military declined to comment.

This week,General Motors announced plans to invest about $4 billion over the next two years in its domestic manufacturing plants to increase U.S. production of both gas and electric vehicles.

The new investment will give GM the ability to assemble more than two million vehicles per year in the U.S. This announcement comes on the heels of the company’s recently announced plan to invest $888 million in the Tonawanda Propulsion plant near Buffalo, New York to support GM’s next-generation V-8 engine.

Plants in Michigan, Kansas, and Tennessee will expand finished vehicle production of several of GM’s most popular vehicles:

Orion Assembly, Orion Township, Michigan: GM will begin production of gas-powered full-size SUVs and light duty pickup trucks at Orion in early 2027 to help meet continued strong demand. As a result, GM says its Factory ZERO in Detroit-Hamtramck, Michigan will be the dedicated assembly location for the Chevrolet Silverado EV, GMC Sierra EV, Cadillac ESCALADE IQ, and GMC HUMMER EV pickup and SUV.

Fairfax Assembly, Kansas City, Kansas: Fairfax Assembly will support production of the gas-powered Chevrolet Equinox beginning in mid-2027. The automaker says sales of the recently redesigned Equinox were up more than 30% year-over-year in the first quarter of 2025. Fairfax remains on track to begin building the 2027 Chevrolet Bolt EV by the end of this year. GM says it expects to make new future investments in Fairfax for GM’s next generation of affordable EVs.

Spring Hill Manufacturing, Spring Hill, Tennessee:GM will add production of the gas-powered Chevrolet Blazer at Spring Hill starting in 2027, alongside the Cadillac LYRIQ and VISTIQ EVs, and the Cadillac XT5.

“We believe the future of transportation will be driven by American innovation and manufacturing expertise,” said Mary Barra, Chair and CEO. “Today’s announcement demonstrates our ongoing commitment to build vehicles in the U.S and to support American jobs. We're focused on giving customers choice and offering a broad range of vehicles they love.”

GM operates 50 U.S. manufacturing plants and parts facilities in 19 states, including 11 vehicle assembly plants. The automaker says nearly one million people in the U.S. depend on GM for their livelihood, including employees, suppliers, and dealers.

“Today’s news goes well beyond the investment numbers — this is about hardworking Americans making vehicles they are proud to build and that customers are proud to own,"" said GM President Mark Reuss. ""As you travel the country, you can see firsthand the scale of our manufacturing footprint and the positive economic impact on our communities and our country.”

GM says it continues to post strong U.S. sales, gaining market share in both gas and electric vehicles. The company says it's on track to deliver its sixth consecutive year as the U.S. full-size pickup sales leader, and its 51st straight year leading in full-size SUVs. In the second half of 2024, GM reports that it became the #2 seller of electric vehicles in the U.S. market, crediting its diverse portfolio of 13 EV models from Chevrolet, Cadillac, and GMC. The automaker says Chevrolet is now the fastest-growing EV brand and #2 among all EV brands in sales.

""We applaud President Trump, the House and Senate for rejecting (California's) unrealistic battery electric vehicle mandate,"" the company said in a statement.
That left many advocates clinging to the latest California rules as a last hope to preserve a regulatory push toward the technology.","Washington — President Donald Trump, with significant fanfare, declared victory Thursday morning over ""electric vehicle mandates"" favored by his predecessor and regulators in California.

""Previous administration gave left-wing radicals dictatorial powers to control the entire car industry,"" he said in the White House East Room to a crowd including auto lobbyists and fossil fuel executives, plus Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy and Energy Secretary Chris Wright.

""Today we're saving California from a disaster and our entire country from a disaster,"" Trump said.

""We're doing a product that works, that's much more efficient, that's better,"" he said.

The president's comments came during a bill-signing ceremony for legislation blocking a federal waiver from the EPA that allowed California to set influential, nation-leading emissions policies for the auto industry. Its latest rules would have required a ramp-up to 100% electrified new vehicle sales by 2035 in participating states.

Though Michigan was not among those states, it would have experienced ripple effects from the new rules, which were set to cover about one-third of the U.S. car and truck market. The Detroit Three automakers and their suppliers would have needed to quickly ramp up EV production and sales well beyond current levels.

California and 10 other states filed a lawsuit immediately after Trump signed three pieces of legislation canceling the Golden State's power to enforce its newest regulations.

This is what leadership looks like,” Congressman James said in a statement. “Washington Elites said it couldn’t be done, but with President Trump’s signature we’ve made good on our promise to protect our jobs, lower prices, defend our supply chains, and keep Democrats' radical Green New Deal agenda out of the driver’s seat.”

""... This is huge a win for the men and women who don’t get days off, who get behind the wheel before sunrise and keep this country running,"" James continued. ""America’s workers don’t need coastal elites from California to Washington, D.C. telling them how to do their jobs — they need the freedom to compete, the infrastructure to deliver, and the respect they’ve earned. I’m proud that my legislation can deliver just that.”

James was among the lawmakers Trump praised for supporting the waiver overturn. He also noted that some Democrats joined overwhelming Republican support in Congress for the effort.

""One Democrat in the Senate,"" Trump said. ""Who was the one?""

""Slotkin,"" someone in the audience called out, referring to Sen. Elissa Slotkin, D-Holly.

""Well ... I shouldn't have asked,"" the president said.

Trump also denounced California regulations for heavy-duty vehicles that would have pushed a transition to EVs in the trucking industry. Less than 1% of Class 8 semi trucks registered in the United States last year were electric, according to data from the American Trucking Association. The industry would have had to reach 75% for new sales in that class by 2035 in participating states.

He signed legislation canceling California’s ability to set those standards too.

The auto industry and oil and gas groups lobbied fiercely to cancel the light-vehicle regulations, while environmental groups held out hope for their survival as perhaps the most ambitious Biden-era effort to curb emissions from the United States' top contributor to planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions.

""Ripping away California’s clean air protections is Trump’s latest betrayal of democracy,” said Dan Becker, director of the Center for Biological Diversity’s Safe Climate Transport Campaign.

He added: “Signing this bill is a flagrant abuse of the law to reward Big Oil and Big Auto corporations at the expense of everyday people’s health and their wallets. Big Oil CEOs who ponied up on Trump’s billion-dollar campaign demand are now getting the big payoff with gutted environmental health protections.""

General Motors Co. cheered Trump and lawmakers for approving the measures.

“GM appreciates Congress’ action to align emissions standards with today’s market realities,"" said company spokesperson Bill Grotz. ""We have long advocated for one national standard that will allow us to stay competitive, continue to invest in U.S. innovation, and offer customer choice across the broadest lineup of gas-powered and electric vehicles.”

Toyota Motor Corp., the second-largest automaker by sales in the United States last year, also praised the action.

""We applaud President Trump, the House and Senate for rejecting (California's) unrealistic battery electric vehicle mandate,"" the company said in a statement. The Japanese automaker has been a purposeful laggard on EVs while the market develops, instead relying on its massive gas-powered hybrid portfolio to power profits.

The statement continued: ""Toyota believes providing consumers with affordable vehicles and a variety of powertrain options is the best and quickest path forward for reducing emissions. A consumer-driven market with one national emissions standard will bring more stability and healthy competition to the auto industry, steady employment for workers and dealers, and more options for American families.”

John Bozzella, president and CEO Alliance for Automotive Innovation, which represents most automakers in the United States, said: “Everyone agreed these EV sales mandates were never achievable and wildly unrealistic. Worse than unachievable – these EV mandates were going to be harmful. Harmful to auto affordability, to consumer choice, to industry competitiveness and to economic activity.""

In his remarks, Trump pointed to investments by automakers in U.S. plants, citing them as evidence his tariffs are working to increase industrial production in the United States. Among them, he said, is Stellantis NV's plans to reopen its Belvidere Assembly Plant in Illinois.

California, thanks to longstanding provisions of the federal Clean Air Act, is able to set its own tailpipe emissions regulations, provided it first gets approval from the EPA. Its latest set of rules would have phased in beginning with the 2026 model year. Companies were facing a 35% electrified sales requirement, which included a partial allowance for gas-electric plug-in hybrid models.

Thirteen states and the District of Columbia had at one point pledged to adopt California's rules, but five later canceled or delayed their commitments as the regulations' start date drew closer.

Virginia canceled its commitment last year under the directive of Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin. Maryland and Vermont pulled back in the weeks leading up to congressional action on the matter, and New York and Massachusetts did the same one day after a key Senate vote on the regulations.

No state, including California, is yet at the 35% benchmark outlined in the rules. Most were not halfway there in 2024, according to sales data compiled by the Alliance for Automotive Innovation.

Nationally, EV adoption grew significantly during President Joe Biden's administration, jumping from about 3% of new vehicle sales at the start of his term in January 2021 to a peak of 11% in December 2023. But growth plateaued over the past two years, with electrified models hovering around 9% to 10% of new vehicle sales.

Biden promoted EVs through a web of policies aimed at automakers, suppliers, consumers and charging providers across the country with the goals of reducing environmental impact and pushing the United States to compete with China's dominant EV industry.

Electric vehicles, notably, are significantly less polluting than internal combustion engine cars and trucks, according to an analysis from BloombergNEF. Though EVs do contribute to pollution through their production process and their use of largely fossil-fuel-derived electricity to charge, their lack of tailpipe emissions makes them far cleaner than ICE models.

Many of Biden's policies to boost EVs, however, are likely to be gutted by a massive Republican tax and spending bill that ends related tax credits, claws back money for chargers and repeals federal emissions standards. The bill also adds a new tax for EV owners.

Republicans have long railed against government support for EVs, with widespread expectation that they would unwind Biden's efforts at the federal level. That left many advocates clinging to the latest California rules as a last hope to preserve a regulatory push toward the technology.

But two important factors led to the rules' demise: Trump's electoral victory in November and Biden's inaction on the waiver until late in his term.

Trump's win enabled the appointment of Zeldin to transmit the waiver to Congress for review, teeing up controversial votes to cancel it under the Congressional Review Act. Democrats and environmental advocates decried the decision to hold votes in the first place after nonpartisan referees ruled that waivers, like the one California received, are not subject to the CRA.

Biden could have skirted the issue altogether by granting the waiver earlier in his presidency.

The CRA gives Congress the power to cancel rules set by outgoing presidents, so long as the rules were finalized within the last 60 legislative days of a given year. But the Democratic former president waited until Dec. 18 to grant the waiver.

Still, even some Democratic lawmakers joined Republicans in voting to nix California's emission waiver, calling the state's rules unrealistic. Eleven of Michigan's 15 members of Congress voted to repeal the waiver, and another three said they supported the policy move but objected for procedural reasons.

California and its state emissions regulator, the California Air Resources Board, have vowed to sue the Trump administration over its cancellation of the waiver.

Gavin Newsom, the state's Democratic governor, said in May that congressional votes on the matter were ""illegal.""

""Republicans went around their own parliamentarian to defy decades of precedent,"" Newsom said in a statement. ""We won’t stand by as Trump Republicans make America smoggy again — undoing work that goes back to the days of Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan — all while ceding our economic future to China.

""We’re going to fight this unconstitutional attack on California in court.""

,Detroit American Energy ,2025-06-12 14:39:12+00:00,Planet Detroit,"Trump EPA targets climate rules that limit emissions from coal, natural gas power plants","Associated Press, Brian Allnutt, Nina Misuraca Ignaczak, Isabelle Tavares",,,,,https://planetdetroit.org/2025/06/epa-emissions-rule-rollback/,"Biden, a Democrat, had made fighting climate change a hallmark of his presidency.
Coal-fired power plants would be forced to capture smokestack emissions or shut down under a strict EPA rule issued last year.
Then-EPA head Michael Regan said the power plant rules would reduce pollution and improve public health while supporting a reliable, long-term supply of electricity.
The power sector is the nation’s second-largest contributor to climate change, after transportation.
“The world is round, the sun rises in the east, coal- and gas-fired power plants contribute significantly to climate change, and climate change increases the risk of heat waves, catastrophic storms and many other health threats,” Frumkin said.","WASHINGTON (AP) — The Environmental Protection Agency on Wednesday proposed repealing rules that limit planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions from power plants fueled by coal and natural gas, an action that Administrator Lee Zeldin said would remove billions of dollars in costs for industry and help “unleash” American energy.

The EPA also proposed weakening a regulation that requires power plants to reduce emissions of mercury and other toxic pollutants that can harm the brain development of young children and contribute to heart attacks and other health problems in adults.

The rollbacks are meant to fulfill Republican President Donald Trump’s repeated pledge to “unleash American energy ” and make it more affordable for Americans to power their homes and operate businesses.

If approved and made final, the plans would reverse efforts by Democratic President Joe Biden’s administration to address climate change and improve conditions in areas heavily burdened by industrial pollution, mostly in low-income and majority Black or Hispanic communities.

The power plant rules are among about 30 environmental regulations that Zeldin targeted in March when he announced what he called the “most consequential day of deregulation in American history.”

Zeldin said Wednesday the new rules would help end what he called the Biden and Obama administrations’ “war on so much of our U.S. domestic energy supply.”

“The American public spoke loudly and clearly last November,” he added in a speech at EPA headquarters. “They wanted to make sure that … no matter what agency anybody might be confirmed to lead, we are finding opportunities to pursue common-sense, pragmatic solutions that will help reduce the cost of living … create jobs and usher in a golden era of American prosperity.”

Rules in EPA crosshairs could save 30,000 lives: Analysis

Environmental and public health groups called the rollbacks dangerous and vowed to challenge the rules in court.

Dr. Lisa Patel, a pediatrician and executive director of the Medical Society Consortium on Climate & Health, called the proposals “yet another in a series of attacks” by the Trump administration on the nation’s “health, our children, our climate and the basic idea of clean air and water.”

She called it “unconscionable to think that our country would move backwards on something as common sense as protecting children from mercury and our planet from worsening hurricanes, wildfires, floods and poor air quality driven by climate change.”

“Ignoring the immense harm to public health from power plant pollution is a clear violation of the law,” added Manish Bapna, president and CEO of the Natural Resources Defense Council. “If EPA finalizes a slapdash effort to repeal those rules, we’ll see them in court.”

The EPA-targeted rules could prevent an estimated 30,000 deaths and save $275 billion each year they are in effect, according to an Associated Press examination that included the agency’s own prior assessments and a wide range of other research.

It’s by no means guaranteed that the rules will be entirely eliminated — they can’t be changed without going through a federal rulemaking process that can take years and requires public comment and scientific justification.

Even a partial dismantling of the rules would mean more pollutants such as smog, mercury and lead — and especially more tiny airborne particles that can lodge in lungs and cause health problems, the AP analysis found. It would also mean higher emissions of greenhouse gases, driving Earth’s warming to deadlier levels.

Biden, a Democrat, had made fighting climate change a hallmark of his presidency. Coal-fired power plants would be forced to capture smokestack emissions or shut down under a strict EPA rule issued last year. Then-EPA head Michael Regan said the power plant rules would reduce pollution and improve public health while supporting a reliable, long-term supply of electricity.

The power sector is the nation’s second-largest contributor to climate change, after transportation.

In its proposed regulation, the Trump EPA argues that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases from fossil fuel-fired power plants “do not contribute significantly to dangerous pollution” or climate change and therefore do not meet a threshold under the Clean Air Act for regulatory action. Greenhouse gas emissions from coal and gas-fired plants “are a small and decreasing part of global emissions,” the EPA said, adding: “This Administration’s priority is to promote the public health or welfare through energy dominance and independence secured by using fossil fuels to generate power.”

The Clean Air Act allows the EPA to limit emissions from power plants and other industrial sources if those emissions significantly contribute to air pollution that endangers public health.

If fossil fuel plants no longer meet the EPA’s threshold, the Trump administration may later argue that other pollutants from other industrial sectors don’t either and therefore shouldn’t be regulated, said Meghan Greenfield, a former EPA and Justice Department lawyer now in private practice at Jenner & Block LLP.

The EPA proposal “has the potential to have much, much broader implications,” she said.

‘These are indisputable facts’

Zeldin, a former New York congressman, said the Biden-era rules were designed to “suffocate our economy in order to protect the environment,” with the intent to regulate the coal industry “out of existence” and make it “disappear.”

National Mining Association president and CEO Rich Nolan applauded the new rules, saying they remove “deliberately unattainable standards” for clean air while “leveling the playing field for reliable power sources, instead of stacking the deck against them.”

But Dr. Howard Frumkin, a former director of the National Center for Environmental Health and professor emeritus at the University of Washington School of Public Health, said Zeldin and Trump were trying to deny reality.

“The world is round, the sun rises in the east, coal- and gas-fired power plants contribute significantly to climate change, and climate change increases the risk of heat waves, catastrophic storms and many other health threats,” Frumkin said. “These are indisputable facts. If you torpedo regulations on power plant greenhouse gas emissions, you torpedo the health and well-being of the American public and contribute to leaving a world of risk and suffering to our children and grandchildren.”

A paper published earlier this year in the journal Science found the Biden-era rules could reduce U.S. power sector carbon emissions by 73% to 86% below 2005 levels by 2040, compared with a reduction of 60% to 83% without the rules.

“Carbon emissions in the power sector drop at a faster rate with the (Biden-era) rules in place than without them,” said Aaron Bergman, a fellow at Resources for the Future, a nonprofit research institution and a co-author of the Science paper. The Biden rule also would result in “significant reductions in sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides, pollutants that harm human health,” he said.

The resolution Trump plans to sign, which Congress approved last month, aims to quash the country’s most aggressive attempt to phase out gas-powered cars.
“We’re fighting back.” According to the White House official, Trump is expected to sign resolutions that block California’s rule phasing out gas-powered cars and ending the sale of new ones by 2035.
In his first term, Trump revoked California’s ability to enforce its standards, but President Joe Biden reinstated it in 2022.
About a dozen states signed on to adopt California’s rule phasing out the sale of new gas-powered cars.","WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump is expected to sign a measure Thursday that blocks California’s first-in-the-nation rule banning the sale of new gas-powered cars by 2035, a White House official told The Associated Press.

The resolution Trump plans to sign, which Congress approved last month, aims to quash the country’s most aggressive attempt to phase out gas-powered cars. He also plans to approve measures to overturn state policies curbing tailpipe emissions in certain vehicles and smog-forming nitrogen oxide pollution from trucks.

The timing of the signing was confirmed Wednesday by a White House official who spoke on condition of anonymity to share plans not yet public.

The development comes as the Republican president is mired in a clash with California’s Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom, over Trump’s move to deploy troops to Los Angeles in response to immigration protests. It’s the latest in an ongoing battle between the Trump administration and heavily Democratic California over everything from tariffs to the rights of LGBTQ+ youth and funding for electric vehicle chargers.

“If it’s a day ending in Y, it’s another day of Trump’s war on California,” Newsom spokesperson Daniel Villaseñor said in an email. “We’re fighting back.”

According to the White House official, Trump is expected to sign resolutions that block California’s rule phasing out gas-powered cars and ending the sale of new ones by 2035. He will also kill rules that phase out the sale of medium- and heavy-duty diesel vehicles and cut tailpipe emissions from trucks.

The president is scheduled to sign the measures and make remarks during an event at the White House on Thursday morning.

Newsom, who is considered a likely 2028 Democratic presidential candidate, and California officials contend that what the federal government is doing is illegal and said the state plans to sue.

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, Energy Secretary Chris Wright and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin are expected to attend, along with members of Congress and representatives from the energy, trucking and gas station industries.

The signings come as Trump has pledged to revive American auto manufacturing and boost oil and gas drilling.

The move will also come a day after the Environmental Protection Agency proposed repealing rules that limit greenhouse gas emissions from power plants fueled by coal and natural gas. Zeldin said it would remove billions of dollars in costs for industry and help “unleash” American energy.

California, which has some of the nation’s worst air pollution, has been able to seek waivers for decades from the EPA, allowing it to adopt stricter emissions standards than the federal government.

In his first term, Trump revoked California’s ability to enforce its standards, but President Joe Biden reinstated it in 2022. Trump has not yet sought to revoke it again.

Republicans have long criticized those waivers and earlier this year opted to use the Congressional Review Act, a law aimed at improving congressional oversight of actions by federal agencies, to try to block the rules.

That’s despite a finding from the U.S. Government Accountability Office, a nonpartisan congressional watchdog, that California’s standards cannot legally be blocked using the Congressional Review Act. The Senate parliamentarian agreed with that finding.

California, which makes up roughly 11% of the U.S. car market, has significant power to sway trends in the auto industry. About a dozen states signed on to adopt California’s rule phasing out the sale of new gas-powered cars.

The National Automobile Dealers Association supported the federal government’s move to block California’s ban on gas-powered cars, saying Congress should decide on such a national issue, not the state.

The American Trucking Associations said the rules were not feasible and celebrated Congress’ move to block them.

Chris Spear, the CEO of the American Trucking Associations, said in a statement Wednesday: “This is not the United States of California.”

It was also applauded by Detroit automaker General Motors, which said it will “help align emissions standards with today’s market realities.”

“We have long advocated for one national standard that will allow us to stay competitive, continue to invest in U.S. innovation, and offer customer choice across the broadest lineup of gas-powered and electric vehicles,” the company said in a statement.

Dan Becker with the Center for Biological Diversity, in anticipation of the president signing the measures, said earlier Thursday that the move would be “Trump’s latest betrayal of democracy.”

“Signing this bill is a flagrant abuse of the law to reward Big Oil and Big Auto corporations at the expense of everyday people’s health and their wallets,” Becker said in a statement.

The original store site has about 45 parking spaces for Recharged cars; adding 8406 W. Broad St. as a Recharged-operated address adds 125 spaces, Foley said.
The recent capital round was funded by New York-based Gutter Capital, of which Recharged is a portfolio company.
When a second location does launch for Recharged, Foley said the company will plan to add car reconditioning and car servicing to the local EV car market on-site.
Recharged currently hires out that work and does not have the space to do it at its West Broad Street location.","As it plots an expansion plan for new locations out of town, a local electric vehicle retailer is also growing the footprint of its Richmond home base.

Recharged, which sells used electric and hybrid vehicles both in-person from its store at 8410 W. Broad St. and through its website, recently took control of the former HoneyCar lot next door at 8406 W. Broad St.

Recharged co-founder John Foley said the added lot will become a “buying and consignment center” for the company’s inventory, while 8410 will focus on sales.

New Recharged signage was set to go up at 8406 on Wednesday and will mark a homecoming of sorts for Foley and some of his staff.

The lot was previously the original location of CarLotz, a once-fast-growing used-car consignment concept for which Foley worked as chief operating officer for eight years before he left in 2022. The Broad Street property became a HoneyCar location in early 2023, after HoneyCar acquired the assets and lease when CarLotz was absorbed by the now-bankrupt Shift Technologies.

Recharged took over the lease at 8406 last July and subleased the location to HoneyCar for a few months as that business wound down its operations. The spot officially became part of Recharged in March, Foley said.

Foley, who co-founded Recharged with Alan Shtraks in 2023, said bringing his own startup to the original CarLotz location carries some extra meaning.

“Some of my current team are CarLotz alums, so it’s a bit of a homecoming for all of us, sitting back in that building,” Foley said. “It’s a little bit ironic that we’re calling that our buying and consignment center, given that consignment was the CarLotz model.”

The expansion next door will give Recharged more room for inventory for in-person and online sales. Along with selling electric cars from brands like Tesla, Kia and Volkswagen, Recharged sells and installs at-home charging stations and provides educational resources about electric vehicles.

The original store site has about 45 parking spaces for Recharged cars; adding 8406 W. Broad St. as a Recharged-operated address adds 125 spaces, Foley said. The existing property has around 2,800 square feet of space in its building; taking on the lease at 8406 gives Recharged about 2,000 square feet of additional office space, he said.

The expansion comes as Recharged is in growth mode fueled by added investor capital.

The company recently closed on a $2 million capital raise, according to an SEC filing June 3.

The recent capital round was funded by New York-based Gutter Capital, of which Recharged is a portfolio company. Foley said Gutter took a stake in Recharged last year when it led an investment round of around $2 million. To date, Recharged has raised more than $5 million from investors since its launch, Foley said.

Other Gutter Capital companies include Tennessee-based food manufacturer operating system Allera and Delaware-based data collection platform Besample.

The Recharged round that closed late last year was focused on building up Recharged’s technology, Foley said, including working on the company’s website, through which customers from across the country can purchase cars. This latest round, Foley said, will be focused on adding new locations, which Recharged calls its “experience centers.”

Foley said the 11-person company is considering new locations in the Southeast, with a particular eye on the Charlotte, North Carolina, area for its second location.

“What we would like to do is continue to grow through the Southeast and ‘mushroom cloud’ out from Richmond,” Foley said.

When a second location does launch for Recharged, Foley said the company will plan to add car reconditioning and car servicing to the local EV car market on-site. Recharged currently hires out that work and does not have the space to do it at its West Broad Street location.

Recharged could also look to establish a third location in Virginia that would be a sort of hub for car reconditioning and servicing.

“We’re considering between Fredericksburg and Richmond so we can service both of those markets and more quickly deliver into the DMV and even up into Pennsylvania and New Jersey, where we do quite a bit of business today.”

Foley told BizSense that Recharged has about 175 cars in its inventory; at its advent, it had around 20. He said 70% to 80% of the company’s inventory gets sold month-to-month.

With only around half of that inventory being sold locally, Foley said it’s important to the Recharged team to continue growth not only in physical locations, but also on its website. Much of the business Recharged does, even in the Richmond area, is done remotely with delivery, he said.

“We’re continuing to build our online capability to buy and sell inventory very quickly and efficiently,” Foley said. “So, when you think about what the next six to 12 months looks like for us, we still see, just before the end of this year, a 100% growth rate from where we are today.”",https://richmondbizsense.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/recharged-foley-700x444.jpg,N,,2025-06-12 23:47:06.932467

Chaewon Chung covers climate change and the environment in the Triad and Northwest North Carolina.","Gov. Josh Stein has urged Congress to protect clean energy investments, amid proposed changes to federal climate policy that could impact progress toward North Carolina’s clean transportation goals.

In an email to The Journal, a spokesperson for Stein said the Democratic governor “supports ZEVs as a solution to help people save money on gas and reduce air pollution,” while noting the benefits the state has seen from “many great companies” involved in battery manufacturing and the ZEV supply chain.

“North Carolina is a leader in the clean energy economy, and many companies have made substantial investments based on existing federal policy,” the spokesperson said. “Governor Stein urges Congress to protect these clean energy investments that have contributed to our state’s prosperity.”

As of February, North Carolina has hit over 112,000 registrations of electric vehicles, which includes more than 85,000 battery electric vehicles (EVs) and about 27,000 plug-in hybrid vehicles (PHEVs), according to the North Carolina Department of Transportation (NCDOT).

Under former Gov. Roy Cooper’s Executive Order 80, North Carolina initially set a goal of reaching 80,000 ZEVs by 2025 — a target that was achieved in November 2023, two years ahead of schedule. Executive Order 246 raised the state’s goal for registered ZEVs to at least 1,250,000 by 2030.

Harrison Fell, an associate professor in the Department of Agricultural and Resource Economics at North Carolina State University, noted that the goal outlined in Executive Order 246 now appears more ambitious than it did when Gov. Cooper first issued it, largely due to growing uncertainty around the future of federal subsidies intended to support EV customers.

The House of Representatives on May 22 passed the ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act,"" which proposes the elimination of the $7,500 federal tax credit for new EVs and the $4,000 credit for used EVs. Under the bill, those credits would end for most vehicles put into service starting in 2026. The bill now moves to the Senate for consideration.

“It remains to be seen what's going to happen once it heads over to the Senate, but I would be very surprised if the EV tax credits survive this tax bill procedure,” Fell said.

“People were trying to buy before the EV tax credits could expire. Now, once the tariffs kick in, and if the EV tax credit is repealed, then the goal of 1.25 million (EV registrations) by 2030 is simply not achievable.”

Harrison pointed to a recent Princeton University study, led by energy expert Jesse Jenkins, that examined the impact of rolling back federal climate policies. In a scenario where all executive actions and tax incentives from the Inflation Reduction Act end after 2025, the study projected 7.4 million fewer battery electric vehicles on U.S. roads by 2030 compared to if the policies were continued.

“I will say that myself and others found Jenkins' original predictions of EV sales under the IRA to be very optimistic, but I think the result that the repeal of EV subsidies will significantly reduce EV sales relative to the case with the subsidy is very likely,” Fell added.

Meanwhile, Forsyth and Guilford counties saw a notable increase in EV registrations, with Forsyth nearing 3,000 and Guilford surpassing 4,700 as of February, marking growth of about 42% and 45%, respectively, compared to the same time last year.

The bill will gut American-made clean energy, kill manufacturing jobs, threaten energy independence, and send household energy costs through the roof.

Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) issued the following statement:

“We say we need more energy in America – the quickest, best, and cheapest way to get it is clean energy. And yet the House has sent us a bill that kills the program…These provisions, if passed, would basically end clean energy…They are making these cuts because they want tax breaks for billionaires…We are sending this message out to our Republican colleagues: Change this bill. It’s horrible for consumers. It’s horrible for jobs. It’s horrible for American independence with China.”

The Republican bill would raise energy costs:

According to nonpartisan experts, annual energy bills across American households would increase by a total of $170 billion during the budget reconciliation window of 2025-2034.

Household energy spending would increase by an average of nearly $150 per year in 2030 and more than $260 per year in 2035.

In North Carolina, household energy spending would increase by an average of more than $290 per year in 2030 and nearly $700 per year in 2035.

In Georgia, household energy spending would increase by an average of nearly $220 per year in 2030 and more than $540 per year in 2035.

In Kansas, household energy spending would increase by an average of more than $210 per year in 2030 and more than $670 per year in 2035.

In Iowa, household energy spending would increase by an average of nearly $210 per year in 2030 and nearly $550 per year in 2035.

In Indiana, household energy spending would increase by an average of nearly $160 per year in 2030 and more than $530 per year in 2035.

In Louisiana, household energy spending would increase by an average of more than $260 per year in 2030 and nearly $800 per year in 2035.

In South Carolina, household energy would increase spending by an average of nearly $350 per year in 2030 and nearly $900 per year in 2035

National wholesale electricity prices would increase 50%.

The Republican bill would kill manufacturing jobs:

Trump’s attacks on clean energy have already threatened or canceled more than 90,000 clean energy manufacturing jobs.

Repealing clean energy tax credits would put 400,000 clean energy manufacturing jobs at risk.

While the proposals were backed by far-right advocacy groups, opponents from some of the state’s strong business lobby convinced a bipartisan group of lawmakers that the bills were bad for the bottom line.

The debate over the failed bills revealed animus among some conservative lawmakers over the expansion of renewable energy in the oil-rich state. One plan that did land on Gov. Greg Abbott’s desk and awaits his signature is a $5 billion addition for the Texas Energy Fund, a low-interest loan program that incentivizes the development of gas-fueled power plants.

Still, the legislative session offered a glimpse at how the energy landscape in Texas is evolving. With increasing power demands, there is pressure to take an all-of-the-above energy approach.

Clean energy advocates said the bills aimed at wind or solar farms did not move beyond committee hearings, in part, because the proposals would have impaired overall energy growth and hurt the future reliability of Texas’s energy grid.

The Texas Public Policy Foundation, a conservative Austin-based think tank, argued against the expansion of renewables with a report that estimated clean energy plants are costing the state an additional $2 billion a year because of the power type’s volatility. When the wind isn’t blowing and the sun isn’t shining, fossil fuel power plants have to ramp up and down more frequently to fill in the gaps, which raises costs, the foundation reported.

During testimony from businesses in rural areas, residents and operators said wind farms have proved crucial in providing ready and affordable energy. More broadly, discussions about the state’s energy mix acknowledged Texas’ reliance on old and new energy sources.

Abigail Ross Hopper, president of Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), one of the largest solar and battery trade groups, said Texas led by example this legislative session with some notable compromises on renewables. “Texas is the energy capital for a reason,” Hopper said. “The economic reality and math of energy demand prevailed in Austin, and that is a good thing for Texans’ energy bills, the economy and grid reliability.”

The Bills That Failed

One bill that fell short, S.B. 388, would have required every watt of new solar generation to be accompanied by a watt of new gas generation. Critics of the legislation said it would have slowed renewables’ expansion at a time when gas producers are experiencing a global shortage of equipment and materials needed to build power plants.

“If you want to bring dispatchable power to the grid, there are so many different levers you could pull,” said Doug Lewin, an energy consultant in Texas. “But pull the ones that actually help something get onto the grid, not push something else down, which is really what that bill would end up doing.” The bill passed in the more conservative Senate and failed to advance beyond a House committee.

Two bills—companion measures in the House and Senate—would have forced existing wind and solar companies to buy fossil fuel-based power or connect to a battery storage resource to cover the hours the energy plants are not operating. Both renewables and oil company lobbyists saw the legislation as adding unnecessary costs.

Environmental and renewable trade groups opposed the attempt at so-called “grid firming,” fearing that it would close existing solar and wind farms. The Texas Oil and Gas Association contested the measures over worries that some member’s investments in renewable energy would be harmed. Some of the group’s more than 4,000 members that produce more than 90 percent of the state’s oil and gas, buy power from solar and wind farms to run some of their operations and feared the proposal would shutter those power plants.

Neither bill—H.B 3356 or S.B. 715—made it out of committee debate. They were sponsored by Rep. Jared Patterson, a Republican from Denton County, and Sen. Kevin Sparks, a Republican from Midland. Patterson previously chaired the House Committee on Protecting Texas LNG. Sparks is the president of Discovery Operating, Inc., a family oil and gas company in Midland.

Patterson said the aim of the legislation was to have producers, not consumers, bear increased costs. That’s what environmental advocates argued would upend the growing renewable industry. Patterson worried about relying on the “whims of nature” but proponents of renewable energy said the caution was misplaced.

The answer was not to force fossil fuel purchases or connections, they said, but to look for more ways to bolster battery storage efforts. Renewables diversify the state’s grid and add capacity, renewable advocates said, making the grid more reliable.

Another bill, sponsored by Sen. Lois Kolkhorst, a Republican from Brenham whose family runs a gasoline and fuel distribution company, attempted to require renewable projects to apply for permits required of no other energy generator.

Kolkhorst’s proposal, S.B. 819, sought to add new guidelines to increase setbacks for wind power projects from property lines. It sparked a lengthy debate about the principles long-heralded by conservatives of individual property rights and limited government.

Of the 126 people who registered to speak at the hearing, 103 signed in as opposed to the measure. Before testimony began, Kolkhorst said permitting in rural Texas was a “sensitive” topic for her and she lamented rural vistas changed by wind turbines and solar panels.

She proposed wind farms be required to have 3,000-foot setbacks, the equivalent of 10 football fields, from private property lines. State Sen. José Menéndez, a Democrat from North Texas, asked if there was a setback requirement on pump jacks for the oil and gas industry. “There are,” Kolkhorst replied. “It’s 200 feet.”

Menendez suggested to her that the bill was biased in its permission to fossil fuel plants or, worse, limited land and opportunities for businesses and investors in clean energy. Setbacks for oil and gas should likely match setbacks for wind farms, he noted, as a matter of fairness. “I just want us to make good public policy that doesn’t take away anyone’s property rights,” he said.

Justin Dreibelbis, CEO of the Texas Wildlife Association, a private land ownership and stewardship organization, supported the bill. The Advanced Power Alliance, an advocacy group for clean energy, argued the bill would hurt development and competition, which conservative lawmakers should support.

Mike Ollinger, a rancher from Armstrong County who operates a wind farm, pointed to his experience in local politics as a former school board member and county commissioner. He said the state lawmakers were out of touch with the challenges of rural counties.

Clean energy projects heavily contribute to the county’s tax base, he said. “Y’all don’t realize what small counties need,” Ollinger said. “We don’t need to be punishing small counties because we don’t have oil and gas.”

Despite not advancing beyond the House for the Governor’s consideration, the anti-renewables legislation progressed further than previous iterations.

Texas’ renewables advocates are now focusing on President Donald Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill” and how it could hurt business efforts locally. Trump is pushing for legislation that dismantles Biden-era incentives to reach his desk by July 4.

Industry leaders and lobbyists in Texas said they plan to share some local knowledge with politicians in Washington: Wind and solar contribute to energy independence and grid reliability—and there will be big job losses if renewable energies are not supported.

Hopper of the Solar Energy Industries Association said if Trump’s bill passes the Senate, her group estimates that more than more than 50 solar and storage factories in Texas could close or be cancelled and more than 34,000 jobs in Texas would be at risk. The Edison Electric Institute, an industry group, has estimated the gutting of clean energy incentives will result in the loss of 87,900 jobs in the state by 2030. That count will rise to more than 115,000 jobs cut by 2035, according to an Edison report.

Those are the sort of economic figures Hopper wants the White House to hear. “With energy demand rising fast in Texas and across the country, we need every electron we can generate to keep the lights on and our economy strong,” Hopper said.",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-2159698059-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-06-12 23:43:17.309924

Valerie Volcovici reports for Reuters.

In short:

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has proposed approving Texas’s application to manage permits for underground carbon dioxide injection, known as Class VI wells, used in carbon capture and storage (CCS).

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin cited Texas's capability to protect drinking water while enabling CCS projects that could curb industrial CO2 emissions and benefit oil companies with deep drilling experience.

Landowners and environmental groups say the plan could worsen groundwater contamination and seismic activity, especially in the Permian Basin, where the state already oversees wastewater disposal linked to similar hazards.

Key quote:

“EPA is taking a key step to support cooperative federalism by proposing to approve Texas to permit Class VI [CO2 injection] wells in the state.”

— Lee Zeldin, EPA Administrator

Why this matters:

Carbon capture and storage is gaining traction as a climate strategy, but the infrastructure it requires — pumping liquefied carbon dioxide deep underground — comes with environmental risks. In Texas, where oil companies stand to profit by adapting existing drilling technology for CCS, oversight questions grow more urgent. Injecting high-pressure fluids underground has been linked to groundwater contamination and earthquakes, particularly in areas already burdened by oil and gas activity.

But a new state law has farmers and environmental advocates raising serious concerns.

Governor Greg Abbott has signed a law that allows oil and gas companies to treat and sell fracking wastewater — also known as produced water — for reuse. That could include discharging it into rivers and streams or even applying it on farmland for crop irrigation.

The move comes as the state faces a growing water shortage due to population growth, aging infrastructure, and prolonged drought conditions. Supporters say the law is a way to supplement water supplies and promote recycling. Critics say it could contaminate the very land Texans depend on for food and survival.

Texas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller believes the concept has potential — if it’s done right.

“Well, we need water,"" Miller said. ""We don’t really care what the source is as long as it’s good, clean water that we can grow crops with. Fracking water would be fine.""

Miller said the goal won't be just to treat the water, but to fully remove harmful substances like heavy metals to ensure it's clean and safe. He added that there are methods to achieve that, and the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality would be responsible for regulating the process.

“As long as this water meets those strict guidelines, I don’t have a problem with it,"" Miller added. ""We need the water, whatever source we can get it from.”

The agriculture commissioner also suggested that the most logical use for treated produced water may not be on crops at all.

“I would suggest, probably, a better use of it would be fracking. Let this oil industry reuse it,"" Miller said. ""They use millions and millions of gallons in fracking, and we certainly don’t need the deep injection wells. Those are proven to cause earthquakes, so we need to do something different with it.""

Miller said technological advancements are bringing the state closer to being able to fully clean and reuse produced water.

“Well, I think we’re pretty close,"" the commissioner said. ""I don’t know that we’re all the way there yet, but with the technology and AI and everything that we’ve got available to us now, we’re in the technology age, so it’s certainly doable and it’s, you know, probably doable pretty quick, I would think.”

He also applauded industry progress in shifting away from fresh water for fracking.

Miller pointed to the oil and gas industry as a positive example, noting that companies are increasingly using brackish water for fracking instead of relying on fresh water. He said about 30% of their operations now use treated brackish water, and praised the shift toward more sustainable practices.

Still, he emphasized the importance of strict oversight.

“Well, it’s the standards that it’s judged by,"" Miller said. ""Obviously, there’s gonna have to be very rigorous, strict guidelines implemented and oversight from the TCEQ. As long as those companies meet all the guidelines that we set out before them and those guidelines are accurate and adequate, I don’t see a problem with it.”

And on the legal protections provided under the new law?

“I think those companies should have some liability protection if they’re doing business in the correct way,” Miller said.

But in Johnson County, where farmers are already fighting toxic sewage-based fertilizer biosolids, there’s outrage that lawmakers gave fracking wastewater the green light, despite it containing many of the same carcinogenic chemicals.

“There was another bill that was put forth that would allow fracking water to be land applied… they’re going to… treat it. And then it’s gonna be safe for land application,” said Dana Ames, a Johnson County landowner and advocate. ""Contaminated with all kinds of chemicals. From oil and gas fracking — we don’t even know all the chemicals because they’re proprietary.""

She questions how the state plans to regulate PFAS — also known as “forever chemicals” — in fracking water, when it hasn’t been able to do so in biosolids.

“TCEQ is also the permitting authority for biosolids, and they say that they’re not able to regulate PFOs in the biosolids. So how are they going to regulate PFOS and fracking?” she asked. “There would be number one, no criminal charge that could be brought. There would be no civil case that could be brought. And that is very, very wrong.""

She believes recycling produced water for oil and gas use makes more sense than spreading it on farmland or dumping it in waterways.

Battery electric vehicles are a really important part of our lineup and we’re expanding how many BEV we sell.","David Christ is Toyota’s Group Vice President and General Manager in North America. Before this position he was Group Vice President and General Manager of Lexus in the U.S. In both roles David oversaw the sales, marketing and customer service for two of the industry’s most successful automotive brands. In the last few weeks Toyota has released a stream of information on everything from all-new models like the 2026 Toyota RAV4 (the best-selling SUV in America) to the latest Toyota EV and electrification goals, which include having over 50% of Toyota’s 2025 sales be either hybrid or electric vehicles.

During this interview Dave talked about Toyota‘s future approach to electric vehicles, the impact of tariffs on Toyota’s product and pricing plans, and how the company will deal with China’s growing influence on the global automotive industry.

Toyota’s EV and Hybrid Plan

Forbes: There’s a lot of going on with Toyota right now, but let’s start with the EV space. We might see the $7,500 electric vehicle incentive go away soon, and it looks like demand for EVs is plateauing at around 8% market share. What’s Toyota’s EV plan look like today?

David Christ: We believe in electric vehicles and we’ve have electric vehicles we’re launching soon and we’re excited about them. We want to have selection in different price positions on our BEV products and give our customers choice. And battery electric vehicles are part of our portfolio approach, which is to say we believe that we should build a multitude of different powertrains, and let the customer decide what’s best for their lifestyle. So we make hybrids, we make plug-in hybrids, we make battery electric vehicles. We also make fuel cell vehicles that we sell in California. And our goal is really to have a lot of choice for the customer and let the customer pick what technology is best for them.

Forbes: Whether you’re talking about hybrid or electric vehicles, they all need batteries of various sizes and it seems like battery prices and the components that go into them just keep getting more expensive and maybe harder to get. It also seems like China did some planning and cornered the market on a lot of battery component elements and rare earth metals. Now we hear we’re going to open some mines up in Nevada and other parts of planet maybe not let them have such a stranglehold on those battery components. How is Toyota dealing with the need to make sure their battery electric vehicles and their hybrid vehicles are sufficiently powered and have enough volume but also wrestle with the cost of electric vehicles – and specifically battery – production.

David Christ: Yeah, it’s a great question. Obviously I’m not a procurement expert, but I will say it’s been pretty well reported how much China controls some of the rare earth materials that go into batteries. We’ve done a really good job of developing a supply chain that’s robust and big enough for us to handle our volume. We’re very proud of the fact that we have significantly increased what we call the electrification of our lineup. In 2023 about 30% of our cars that we sold in the US were what we call electrified, meaning hybrid, plug-in hybrid, or BEV, or fuel cell. Last year it was 45%. This year it’s going to be over 50%. So every year we have moved forward in putting more electrified cars on the road. It’s what our customers want and it’s also really good for the environment. And the other thing we’ve done, which we started many years ago, we made a really significant investment in the state of North Carolina to build a battery plan that’s going to build batteries for BEV‘s and hybrids and plug-in hybrids. So we’ll really be able to supply the U.S. from North Carolina for our hybrid powertrains.

Forbes: Nobody knows for sure, but where do you see, say 10 years from now, battery electric vehicles (BEVs), hybrids, plug-in hybrids and traditional gasoline cars. What will be the breakdown, either for the US market or specifically for Toyota?

David Christ: It’s a great question. We’ve always believed in customer choice and we have stuck to our strategy, that the portfolio approach – making several options available to customers – is the best. Battery electric vehicles are a really important part of our lineup and we’re expanding how many BEV we sell. We’re also expanding what categories of price positioning they are in so that we can have more BEV‘s for more customers. But the truth is not every customer can use a BEV every day. Some people with long commutes, or people that travel extensively outside of where there’s charging, the BEV is just not right for them. Well then here comes plug-in hybrids. Those are great options for those people because a lot around town driving is in an EV mode, and then if they need to go on a long trip they fall back to the hybrid powertrain. And then of course hybrids, we’ve been industry leader in hybrids. We started selling hybrids in 1997 with Prius. We’ve really, we feel, perfected that technology and that’s a great option for customers as well. So overall we’re going to expand those options throughout our lineup, and we’re gonna give customers the choice and let them pick.

Forbes: What do you consider Toyota‘s strength right now, product wise. You just mentioned hybrids, and that’s a kind of drivetrain, but what about specific vehicle types? For both Toyota and Lexus where do you feel like your company is well positioned and, conversely, where would you like to see more attention played or more resources thrown in future?

David Christ: I think our strength in our product lineup is we listen to our customers. You know Corolla Cross is a great example. In 2022 we came out with the Corolla Cross, which is smaller and more cost-effective than RAV4, and we did that because our consumers were saying that they wanted a lower priced SUV. So here comes the Corolla Cross, and we’ve done that similarly throughout the lineup. Our GR products – super fun to drive, exhilarating performance, all because our customers wanted the fun-to-drive aspect of a car. And it’s a commitment that the two door sports car and the four-door fun hatchback, or fun wagon, is not dead. So we really just listen to customers and then we try and provide products that fit their needs.

Toyota’s Tariff Plan

Forbes: What, if anything, has Toyota done as a result of all this tariff turbulence over the last few months. It seems like you shouldn’t do anything because nobody knows when they’re going to settle in and you don’t want to make long-term plans based on short term turbulence.

David Christ: We’re an action oriented company, and our dealers are action oriented people, and there’s been a lot of “What are we going to do?” And our response has been, “We’re in a wait-and-see mode.”And the reason we’re wait-and-see is exactly what you said – you don’t want to make a production or a pricing decision that has long range impact in a short term decision-making timeframe. Once we know the full scope of the tariff impact we’ll obviously evaluate where we build our cars, we’ll evaluate how we price our cars, and we’ll make decisions accordingly. But we’re not in a rush to overcompensate right now because of where we are today. So we’re in a wait-and-see, and I know for some people that’s hard because you want to know what’s next. But sometimes slow-and-steady wins the race, so we’re being patient.

Toyota EVs and China

Forbes: On the opposite end of spectrum is long-term planning, and it seems like China is this unrelenting force globally in their ability to produce low priced vehicles that are getting better and better. It’s not just low-cost vehicles that are clearly reflective their low cost. They’re actually pretty desirable. And there’s a certain amount of protection that the U.S. market is going to have because of tariffs. But a lot of other markets, Europe and parts of Asia, see China sucking up a lot of market share. What’s Toyota‘s long-term thoughts to counter the Chinese automotive industry’s growth?

David Christ: We know the China market well. We have obviously a big presence in China, Toyota does, and so does Lexus. So we know that market, we build in that market, we sell in that market. Obviously it’s a big global competitor. They don’t sell any products in the US. Obviously that’s a political discussion for other people to figure out. Until they’re here in the U.S. we just keep our focus on the Chinese market for Japan, for Toyota there, and the team there does a really good job. We’ve been growing in China and I think it’s a long-term good market for us.

Forbes: So you feel pretty well positioned in spite of China’s constant growth globally.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/684a22d18a41808d54742935/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,N,,2025-06-12 23:47:23.818733

The projects would amount to 58,000 megawatts of new generation capacity, enough to power more than 8 million average American households, although many likely won’t move past the planning stage. The report said proposed plants in Texas aim to support data centers for artificial intelligence and other heavy industries. They would also add an estimated 115 million metric tons of greenhouse gases every year to the atmosphere–as much as nearly 27 million more gasoline-powered cars on the road.

“Building more natural gas infrastructure and power plants would saddle Texas’ growing population with more health-harming pollution and contribute to planet-warming greenhouse gases,” according to the 24-page report written by research analyst Griffin Bird.

The research reviewed permit applications, government data, public announcements and records from Texas’ grid operator to tally 108 proposed new gas plants and 17 expansions. That includes four projects currently under construction, 33 that have received permits but haven’t broken ground and 98 that are proposed. More than 60 projects aim for completion by the end of 2028.

The rapid buildout mirrors a global trend and comes as Texas authorities expect statewide power demand to nearly double by 2030, driven largely by a proliferation of advanced computing facilities.

“The sheer volume of additional gas projects quickly popping up in Texas that EIP have been flagging through air permit applications is indeed astonishing,” said Jenny Martos, manager of the oil and gas plant tracker at Global Energy Monitor, a California-based nonprofit.

Martos said gas power expansion globally is largely seen in Asian countries. In the U.S., Texas leads all other states in existing gas power generation and planned gas power generation, as well as production of oil and gas. It is also a leader in renewable energy.

Still, Martos said the gas projects face “headwinds” and uncertainties. Among them: the use and possible regulations of artificial intelligence technology and the massive speculative energy demands related to AI’s evolution.

A year ago, the Biden Administration was urging 100 percent renewable energy in the United States by 2035. Now, the AI boom has upended all calculations. Energy projects face supply delays and prices have surged for gas-fired turbines, essential for production.

“Manufacturers were caught flat-footed,” said Daniel Cohan, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at Rice University in Houston. “The cost of the gas turbines is now more than the cost of wind and solar farms, even before considering that you have to pay for the fuel.”

Authorities in Texas have taken steps to support natural gas as the predominant power source, even after years of steep growth in the state’s wind and solar power generation. During legislative sessions in 2023 and 2025, lawmakers provided a total $10 billion in public financing of low-cost loans for new gas plants. No such taxpayer funds were designated to encourage wind or solar farms.

Projections of data center growth and energy consumption have led to optimistic expectations for Texas gas producers.

Residents who live near planned gas plants are less enthusiastic. In the tiny town of Blue in Lee County, neighbors are fighting plans for a massive power plant that would primarily serve private, commercial customers many miles away. They are worried about air, noise and light pollution and their quality of life.

“If you’re going to build a bunch of gas plants, don’t plop them down in the middle of nice, quiet, peaceful communities like ours,” said Travis Brown, a former state department of agriculture worker and spokesman for a group called Move the Gas Plant. “Preserving what’s left of rural Texas should be a priority. That’s an important part of our culture and our heritage.”

Report Alleges Improper Emission Permitting

While natural gas burns much cleaner than coal, it still creates soot and emissions including greenhouse gases that warm the planet, nitrogen oxides that contribute to ozone formation, and known human carcinogens like benzene and formaldehyde.

The Environmental Integrity Project report found, in some cases, Texas allowed developers of large gas power plants to circumvent big parts of the permit process for major pollution sources. Companies underrepresented prospective emissions in their applications and then sought “standard” permits meant for smaller facilities rather than new “major source” permits, the EIP report found. Major source permitting requires more time for public notice and comment and companies must commit to the best available emissions control technology.

One example cited by EIP: EmberGreen and EmberYork, related companies that received permits for two 900 MW gas plants in the towns of Sealy and Wharton.

The permit applications represented the facilities’ emissions as below the thresholds of major pollution sources for carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides and formaldehyde when assuming 3,900 hours of operation, or about 162 days, per year. However, EIP wrote, the facilities’ permits contained no requirement to limit operations to 3,900 hours per year, or to report operating hours.

Likewise, a 930 MW gas plant by ENGIE in Robstown received permits as a minor source assuming 2,000 hours of annual operation. But its permit also included no limitations of operating hours.

The state’s environmental regulator, the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ), has routinely enabled industrial developers to avoid the requirements of major source pollution review by issuing smaller permits, according to a 2023 investigation by Inside Climate News and the Texas Tribune.

The TCEQ did not respond to queries from Inside Climate News about the new report, nor did EmberClear or ENGIE.

Patton Dycus, EIP’s senior attorney, said federal law requires emissions sources to be evaluated based on their full capacity to emit unless they are specifically limited in permits. In April, Dycus wrote the federal Environmental Protection Agency urging a review of Texas’s permitting of the new gas plants.

“If new gas-fired plants that are major sources of criteria pollutants are constructed without the required Clean Air Act construction permits, that construction would be unlawful,” the letter said. “TCEQ must not permit future similar gas-fired power plants through standard permitting.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/4O6A0125-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-06-12 23:43:54.474056

Zeldin says the proposals are part of a broader push to end what he calls the “war” on domestic energy and to lower the cost of living.

Critics, however, argue the changes violate clean air laws and threaten public health. Legal challenges are expected if the rules move forward.

Barclay Rogers, CEO of carbon removal company Graphyte, stated: “The American economy thrives on innovation, and as demand for electricity grows due to AI, data centers, and reshoring of US manufacturing, that innovation must focus on expanding supply without increasing CO2 emissions.”

“If we’re going to pull back rules on emissions from power plants, we need to accelerate efforts to remove CO2 from the atmosphere with immediately scalable carbon removal solutions that support economic growth and reduce the rising costs of climate-related events.”

The EPA now claims that emissions from fossil-fueled plants don’t significantly contribute to dangerous pollution under the Clean Air Act — a position that could weaken regulation across other industrial sectors.

While the rule changes must undergo a lengthy review and public comment process, even partial repeals could have lasting environmental consequences.",https://carbonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/pxclimateaction-7129875_1280.jpg,N,,2025-06-12 23:43:58.624441

“HB 14 creates the Texas Advanced Nuclear Development Fund and Grant Program, a reimbursement grants program, a dedicated account in the general revenue fund able to receive appropriations, gifts, grants and donations to cover the costs of development-construction of advanced nuclear reactors in Texas,” Longanecker said.
“House Bill 48 requires the director of the Department of Public Safety to create an organized oilfield theft prevention unit,” Longanecker said.
The task force is required to include representatives from the oil and gas industry, an energy trade association and law enforcement agencies.
Through the asset forfeiture process, the bill allows an officer who takes custody of a petroleum product alleged to have been stolen to arrange for the total amount of the petroleum product to be sold at market rate.","Pending Gov. Greg Abbott’s approval, the State of Texas is getting into the nuclear energy business in a big way with the establishment within the governor’s office of the Texas Advanced Nuclear Energy Office.

The enabling legislation, House Bill 14 by Palestine Republican Rep. Cody Harris, would provide strategic leadership, coordination and support for the development of advanced nuclear reactor technologies including Generation III and IV reactors like large light water reactors, small modular reactors, micro-reactors and nuclear cogeneration facilities.

Texas Independent Producers & Royalty Owners President Ed Longanecker said the nuclear office would identify regulatory and financial barriers, promote public outreach and education, collaborate with stakeholders in higher education, industry and regulators and help develop a strategic plan for nuclear energy development in Texas.

It has a statutory sunset date of Sept. 1, 2040.

“HB 14 creates the Texas Advanced Nuclear Development Fund and Grant Program, a reimbursement grants program, a dedicated account in the general revenue fund able to receive appropriations, gifts, grants and donations to cover the costs of development-construction of advanced nuclear reactors in Texas,” Longanecker said.

Project Development and Supply Chain Reimbursement grants are capped at the lesser of 50% of qualifying expenses or $12.5 million and Construction Reimbursement grants can be up to the lesser of 50% of qualifying expenses or $120 million, he said.

“There are also Completion and Operation grants available for projects capable of interconnecting with the ERCOT grid,” Longanecker said. “Grants are primarily for expenses paid by the recipient’s own funds and are tied to benchmarks and milestones.”

Lastly, he said, the bill will establish a Nuclear Permitting Coordinator for the state and an Advanced Nuclear Energy Workforce Development Program and it will require a regulatory study to identify necessary state regulatory functions related to nuclear energy generation facilities in Texas.

A report is due by Dec. 1, 2026. The bill was on its way to the governor with an effective date of Sept. 1.

During the recently concluded 89th Texas Legislative Session, Longanecker said, 9,014 bills and constitutional amendments were introduced and 1,169 passed.

“TIPRO tracked and-or lobbied more than 258 pieces of legislation which pertained to the oil and gas industry, either directly or indirectly, and took formal positions on 98 bills,” he said. “100 percent of bills opposed by TIPRO failed and 75 percent of the bills we supported passed.”

He said key areas of focus for TIPRO included funding for the Railroad Commission of Texas and Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, oilfield theft, infrastructure, electricity and grid reliability, orphan and inactive wells, water and produced water management and wildfire management, among numerous others.

“Both the RRC and TCEQ fared very well for the upcoming budget cycle, each obtaining almost everything they asked for in the new biennium’s budget,” Longanecker said. “Of the RRC’s total budget for the biennium, totaling $458.7 million in all funds, the agency received dollars for the below exceptional items they requested: oil and gas orphaned well plugging, $100 million; Produced Water Injection Data Reporting System, $7.6 million; Oil and Gas Authorized Pit Registration System, $2.7 million; Oversight and Safety Regulatory Filing and Permitting Systems, $6.2 million; Underground Injection Well Investigation Team, $1.3 million; Site Remediation Program Support, $342,000; GIS Cloud Upgrade, $2.1 million; and vehicle replacements, $4.8 million.

“That’s almost $133 million in exceptional items,” he said. “The agency did an incredible job of getting badly needed budget dollars.

“The only item of the agency’s exceptional items that was not funded was the request for microfilm digitization. The RRC asks for these specific funds every legislative session and the legislature has never provided them. The cost of this item is $907,000 and the agency will find the funds elsewhere in its budget to continue its digitization work.”

Of the TCEQ’s total budget for the biennium, totaling $918.2 million in all funds, Longanecker said, the agency got funding to enhance permitting, compliance and public engagement, $26.3 million; salary and retention efforts, $39.5 million; produced water, $6.7 million; and administrative support, $4.06 million.

“During the interim TIPRO met with a broad group of stakeholders on the topic of oilfield theft to develop solutions to mitigate and prosecute this illicit activity, many of which took the form of legislation during the 89th Session,” he said. “These bills passed and were signed into law by Gov. Abbott.

“House Bill 48 requires the director of the Department of Public Safety to create an organized oilfield theft prevention unit,” Longanecker said. “In addition to enforcing laws pertaining to the theft of oil, gas and related equipment, the unit will also develop and deploy specialized training, resources and policing strategies tailored to investigating and preventing organized oilfield theft to local law enforcement.

“They will conduct public outreach and awareness initiatives to educate industry professionals and communities on organized oilfield theft prevention; and maintain a centralized database for tracking organized oilfield theft incidents and related criminal enterprises.

“The bill will also require DPS to submit a biennial report to the legislature detailing the unit’s activities and effectiveness and include legislative or administrative recommendations to improve its efficacy.”

He said Senate Bill 494 requires the RRC to create a task force focused on preventing the theft of petroleum products. The task force is required to include representatives from the oil and gas industry, an energy trade association and law enforcement agencies.

The task force is required to meet quarterly and may conduct meetings virtually. It will conduct a continuous study on the theft of petroleum products including reviewing laws in other jurisdictions and analyzing impacts on sales tax and long-term economics.

Recommendations from the committee must include outreach and training for law enforcement on combating theft. The task force is permitted to consult with external organizations and share information on criminal investigations, providing exceptions to some confidentiality rules.

Finally, SB 494 requires a report to be submitted biennially to the governor, the lieutenant governor, the speaker of the House of Representatives, the RRC and each standing committee of the Legislature with primary jurisdiction over oil and gas matters, emphasizing legislative recommendations for transparency, security and economic impacts related to theft.

Senate Bill 1806 authorizes specially trained DPS agents to conduct comprehensive inspections of cargo tanks suspected of being used to transport a petroleum product in the state and submit the sample to a crime laboratory for forensic analysis.

Through the asset forfeiture process, the bill allows an officer who takes custody of a petroleum product alleged to have been stolen to arrange for the total amount of the petroleum product to be sold at market rate.

The process allows for stolen product to be recovered by whom the product was stolen from or recoup the funds if proved it was their product stolen.

The bill defines oil and gas equipment and increases the penalties for theft of petroleum products and oil and gas equipment and adds the following offenses to the increased penalty ladder: 1) transporting to a waste disposal location a petroleum product in which the initial owner cannot be identified, 2) purchasing petroleum products from a person who is not authorized by the Railroad Commission of Texas to sell the petroleum product and 3) storing, purchasing or trading a petroleum product for financial benefit by means of a method that is not authorized by the Railroad Commission of Texas.

Finally, the bill creates a criminal offense for operating a disposal well without a permit from the Railroad Commission with fines up to $10,000 for a third degree felony, $10,000 to $100,000 for a second degree felony and more than $100,000 for a first degree felony.

Senate Bill 1646 aims to protect critical infrastructure by combating copper theft and fiber vandalism.

“Another ongoing priority for TIPRO is funding for infrastructure,” Longanecker said. “Significant investments are planned for state infrastructure needs including approximately $39.9 billion for transportation planning, design, construction and maintenance, around $2.5 billion in one-time funding for critical water infrastructure and a dedicated $1 billion annually to the Texas Water Fund and another $5 billion for the Texas Energy Fund to support natural gas power plant development.”",https://www.oaoa.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/OAT060525-Abbott-bill-sign.jpg,N,,2025-06-12 23:44:12.420699

Inc (JERA) for a 20-year sale and purchase agreement for liquefied natural gas (LNG) offtake of 1.5 million tonnes per annum (Mtpa) on a free on board basis from the Port Arthur LNG Phase 2 development project in Jefferson County, Texas.

""We are pleased to collaborate with JERA, Japan's largest power generation company and one of the world's largest LNG buyers, as they continue to work with the United States to diversify their sources to help strengthen the resilience and dependability of their energy supply,"" said Justin Bird, chief executive officer of Sempra Infrastructure. ""With this announcement, we continue to make steady progress towards reaching a final investment decision for the project, which is expected to extend the reach of U.S. natural gas to global energy markets.""

The proposed Port Arthur LNG Phase 2 development project is competitively positioned and is under active marketing. Future phases are also in the early development stage.

The project has received all its key permits and is expected to include two liquefaction trains capable of producing approximately 13 Mtpa of LNG, which could increase the total liquefaction capacity of the Port Arthur LNG facility from approximately 13 Mtpa for Phase 1, which is under construction, to up to approximately 26 Mtpa.

The project received authorization from the U.S. Department of Energy in May to export U.S. LNG to countries that do not have a free-trade agreement with the U.S. The project also received authorization from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in September 2023.

In June 2024, Sempra Infrastructure and a subsidiary of Aramco signed a non-binding heads of agreement contemplating both a long-term LNG offtake agreement and an equity investment in the Port Arthur LNG Phase 2 project. In July 2024, Sempra Infrastructure announced that Bechtel had been selected for a fixed-price engineering, procurement and construction contract for the project.

The Port Arthur LNG Phase 1 project is currently under construction and expected to achieve commercial operation in 2027 and 2028 for trains 1 and 2, respectively.

The development of the Port Arthur LNG Phase 2 project remains subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including completing the required commercial agreements, securing and/or maintaining all necessary permits, obtaining financing and reaching a final investment decision, among other factors.

BP received a $98 million grant from the U.S. Department of Energy two years ago for carbon storage projects in Indiana, Illinois and Michigan.","Oil company BP has put a project to store its carbon emissions underground in Indiana on hold. The company planned to pipe carbon dioxide from its Whiting Refinery and store it in rural areas to the south — in counties like Newton, Jasper, Pulaski, White and Benton.

It was part of BP's effort to make ""blue"" hydrogen — which is made using energy from fossil fuels, but includes carbon storage. BP is one of several companies that committed to grow clean hydrogen in the region as part of the Midwest Alliance for Clean Hydrogen or MachH2. It's not clear what BP's decision to pause the project means for the hydrogen hub overall.

BP did seismic testing in Benton County to see if it would be a viable place for storage. But Benton County Commissioner John Gick said it's unlikely landowners would have allowed the company to store CO2 there — few residents were in favor of the project.

They expressed concerns about everything from earthquakes, to contaminating drinking water to hurting crops.

""Not knowing what that could or could not do to our ground should there be a leak — there's just too many unknowns,"" Gick said.

A state law also made Indiana taxpayers liable for incidents that happen years after carbon storage facilities close.

Residents living along the path of the pipeline in northwest Indiana also had concerns about the project.

Lisa Vallee is with the group Just Transition Northwest Indiana and lives within a mile of the refinery. She said residents worried leaks in the pipeline could contaminate drinking water or cause an explosion.

Several environmental groups have come out against carbon capture and storage because it allows companies to continue to pollute rather than forcing them to reduce their emissions.

Still, Vallee said the fact that BP is reneging on some of its climate commitments and jobs for the community is disheartening. In February, the company cut $5 billion in funding for renewable projects.

""When it is no longer profitable, when they no longer are getting tax credits — for example, for wind and solar energy,"" Vallee said. ""They are backing away from that.""

The Trump administration's shift away from climate efforts is partly behind BP's decision to pause the carbon storage project.

In a statement, the company cited economic uncertainty, the slow-developing hydrogen market and BP's renewed focus on oil and gas, among other reasons.

""This decision relates solely to BP's involvement in the Midwest and not to any other low-carbon hydrogen project BP may develop elsewhere in the U.S. or globally,"" BP said in a statement.

Last month, U.S. Sen. Jim Banks (R-Ind.) and U.S. Rep. Frank Mrvan (D-Highland) wrote a letter to the U.S. energy secretary in support of the hydrogen hub.

June 11, 2025

Contact Information

EPA Press Office (press@epa.gov)

WASHINGTON – Today, alongside U.S. Senator Kevin Cramer (R-ND), House Energy and Commerce Chairman Brett Guthrie (R-KY-02), U.S. Representatives Troy Balderson (R-OH-12), Carol Miller (R-WV-01), Dan Meuser (R-PA-09), Rob Bresnahan (R-PA-08), and Michael Rulli (R-OH-06), and Navajo Nation President Buu Nygren, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Lee Zeldin announced two proposals in an important step towards ensuring affordable, dependable energy for American families and restore American energy dominance. EPA is proposing to repeal all “greenhouse gas” emissions standards for the power sector under Section 111 of the Clean Air Act (CAA) and to repeal amendments to the 2024 Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS) that directly result in coal-fired power plants having to shut down. These Biden-era regulations have imposed massive costs on coal-, oil-, and gas-fired power plants, raising the cost of living for American families, imperiling the reliability of our electric grid, and limiting American energy prosperity.

“Affordable, reliable electricity is key to the American dream and a natural byproduct of national energy dominance,” said EPA Administrator Zeldin. “According to many, the primary purpose of these Biden-Harris administration regulations was to destroy industries that didn't align with their narrow-minded climate change zealotry. Together, these rules have been criticized as being designed to regulate coal, oil and gas out of existence.”

Ensuring affordable and reliable energy supplies drives down the costs of transportation, heating, utilities, farming, and manufacturing while boosting our national security. Coal and natural gas power plants are essential sources of baseload power that are needed to fuel manufacturing and turn the United States into the Artificial Intelligence capital of the world. The proposed repeals would remove regulatory barriers that limit access to our Nation’s energy resources and unleash America’s true potential.

Proposal to repeal Obama and Biden Administrations’ regulations on power plants

EPA is proposing to repeal the 2015 emissions standards for new fossil fuel-fired power plants issued during the Obama-Biden Administration, and the 2024 rule for new and existing fossil fuel-fired power plants issued during the Biden-Harris Administration.

The first Clean Power Plan was struck down by the Supreme Court in 2022. Many have voiced concerns that the last administration’s replacement for that rule is similarly overreaching and an attempt to shut down affordable and reliable electricity generation in the United States, raising prices for American families, and increasing the country’s reliance on foreign-made energy.

In West Virginia v. EPA, the U.S. Supreme Court held that the major questions doctrine barred EPA from misusing the Clean Air Act to manipulate Americans’ energy choices and shift the balance of the nation’s electrical fuel mix. The Biden Administration issued its own rule in 2024, which many critics say is just another attempt to achieve the unlawful fuel-shifting goals of the Clean Power Plan.

Unlike other air pollutants with a regional or local impact, the targeted emissions are global in nature. As a result, any potential public health harms have not been accurately attributed to emissions from the U.S. power sector. In light of this, EPA is proposing that the CAA requires the agency to make a finding that the targeted emissions from fossil fuel-fired power plants significantly contribute to dangerous air pollution before regulating these emissions from this source category. In addition, EPA is proposing that greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel-fired power plants do not contribute significantly to dangerous air pollution within the meaning of the statute.

As an alternative, EPA is proposing to repeal the most burdensome set of requirements issued for new and existing fossil fuel-fired steam generating units—specifically, the emission guidelines for existing power plants, and carbon capture and sequestration/storage-based requirements for new combustion turbines and modified coal plants. As part of this alternative proposal, EPA is taking comment on the efficiency-based requirements for new natural gas power plant requirements.

Based on EPA’s estimates, this proposal would save the power sector $19 billion in regulatory costs over two decades beginning in 2026, or about $1.2 billion a year.

Read more about this action in the Greenhouse Gas Standards and Guidelines for Fossil Fuel-Fired Power Plants Rule Proposal.

Proposal to repeal certain amendments to the 2024 Mercury and Air Toxics Standards

EPA is also proposing to repeal certain amendments issued on May 7, 2024, to the National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for Coal- and Oil-Fired Electric Utility Steam Generating Units – a rule commonly known as the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards for power plants, or simply MATS. This proposal would revert back to 2012 standards that have driven sharp reductions in harmful air toxic pollutants from coal- and oil-fired power plants.

The 2024 MATS rule has caused significant regulatory uncertainty, especially for coal plants in Florida, Illinois, Kentucky, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, North Carolina, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, Texas, West Virginia, and Wyoming. $1.2 billion over the next decade starting in 2028, or about $120 million a year for the power sector. These costs are large and unnecessary given the success the industry has already achieved in reducing emissions of mercury and other hazardous air pollutants.

This action proposes to relieve all facilities of the more stringent filterable particulate matter (PM) emission standard for coal-fired EGUs, the tighter mercury standard for lignite-fired EGUs, and the requirement to use PM Continuous Emissions Monitoring Systems (CEMS).

The original MATS Rule was promulgated in 2012 and has since been highly effective in protecting public health and the environment. Specifically, 2021 mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants were 90 percent lower than pre-MATS levels. Since 2010, acid gas hazardous air pollutant emissions have been reduced by over 96 percent, and emissions of the non-mercury metals – including nickel, arsenic, and lead – have been reduced by more than 81 percent.

This proposed action would enhance efforts to Restore American Energy Dominance by removing costly burdens on coal- and oil-fired power plants while still accomplishing the EPA’s core mission of protecting human health and the environment.

EPA estimates that this proposed repeal of the 2024 MATS Amendments would save $1.2 billion in regulatory costs over a decade, or about $120 million a year.

The new investment will give GM the ability to assemble more than two million vehicles per year in the U.S.

The announcement comes on the heels of the company’s recently announced plan to invest $888 million in the Tonawanda Propulsion plant near Buffalo, New York to support GM’s next-generation V-8 engine.

The expanded plants in Michigan, Kansas, and Tennessee will expand finished vehicle production of several of GM’s most popular vehicles:

Orion Assembly, Orion Township, MI: GM will begin production of gas-powered full-size SUVs and light duty pickup trucks at Orion in early 2027 to help meet continued strong demand. As a result, GM’s Factory ZERO in Detroit-Hamtramck, Michigan will be the dedicated assembly location for the Chevrolet Silverado EV, GMC Sierra EV, Cadillac ESCALADE IQ, and GMC HUMMER EV pickup and SUV.

Fairfax Assembly, Kansas City, KS: Fairfax Assembly will support production of the gas-powered Chevrolet Equinox beginning in mid-2027. Sales of the recently redesigned Equinox were up more than 30% year-over-year in the first quarter of 2025. Fairfax remains on track to begin building the 2027 Chevrolet Bolt EV by the end of this year. GM expects to make new future investments in Fairfax for GM’s next generation of affordable EVs.

Spring Hill Manufacturing, Spring Hill, TN: GM will add production of the gas-powered Chevrolet Blazer at Spring Hill starting in 2027, alongside the Cadillac LYRIQ and VISTIQ EVs, and the Cadillac XT5.

“We believe the future of transportation will be driven by American innovation and manufacturing expertise,” said Mary Barra, Chair and CEO, GM. “Today’s announcement demonstrates our ongoing commitment to build vehicles in the U.S and to support American jobs. We’re focused on giving customers choice and offering a broad range of vehicles they love.”

GM has a network of 50 U.S. manufacturing plants and parts facilities in 19 states, including 11 vehicle assembly plants. Nearly one million people in the U.S. depend on GM for their livelihood, including employees, suppliers, and dealers.

“Today’s news goes well beyond the investment numbers — this is about hardworking Americans making vehicles they are proud to build and that customers are proud to own,” said GM President Mark Reuss. “As you travel the country, you can see firsthand the scale of our manufacturing footprint and the positive economic impact on our communities and our country.”

GM continues to post strong U.S. sales, gaining market share in both gas and electric vehicles. The company is on track to deliver its sixth consecutive year as the U.S. full-size pickup sales leader, and its 51st straight year leading in full-size SUVs. In the second half of 2024, GM became the #2 seller of electric vehicles in the U.S. market, thanks to its diverse portfolio of 13 EV models from Chevrolet, Cadillac, and GMC. Chevrolet is now the fastest-growing EV brand and #2 among all EV brands in sales.

GM’s 2025 capital spending guidance is unchanged at between $10 billion and $11 billion. Going forward, GM expects its annual capital spending will be in a range of $10 billion to $12 billion through 2027, reflecting increased investment in the U.S., the prioritization of key programs, and efficiency offsets.",https://businessfacilities.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/gm-picture1.png,N,,2025-06-12 23:47:28.810032

Coal-fired power plants would be forced to capture smokestack emissions or shut down under a strict EPA rule issued last year.
Then-EPA head Michael Regan said the power plant rules would reduce pollution and improve public health while supporting a reliable, long-term supply of electricity.
The power sector is the nation’s second-largest contributor to climate change, after transportation.
“The world is round, the sun rises in the east, coal- and gas-fired power plants contribute significantly to climate change, and climate change increases the risk of heat waves, catastrophic storms and many other health threats,” Frumkin said.","WASHINGTON, D.C., USA — The Environmental Protection Agency on Wednesday proposed repealing rules that limit planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions from power plants fueled by coal and natural gas, an action that Administrator Lee Zeldin said would remove billions of dollars in costs for industry and help “unleash” American energy.

The EPA also proposed weakening a regulation that requires power plants to reduce emissions of mercury and other toxic pollutants that can harm the brain development of young children and contribute to heart attacks and other health problems in adults.

The rollbacks are meant to fulfill Republican President Donald Trump's repeated pledge to “ unleash American energy ” and make it more affordable for Americans to power their homes and operate businesses.

If approved and made final, the plans would reverse efforts by Democratic President Joe Biden's administration to address climate change and improve conditions in areas heavily burdened by industrial pollution, mostly in low-income and majority Black or Hispanic communities.

The power plant rules are among about 30 environmental regulations that Zeldin targeted in March when he announced what he called the “most consequential day of deregulation in American history.”

Zeldin said Wednesday the new rules would help end what he called the Biden and Obama administrations’ “war on so much of our U.S. domestic energy supply.”

“The American public spoke loudly and clearly last November,'' he added in a speech at EPA headquarters. “They wanted to make sure that … no matter what agency anybody might be confirmed to lead, we are finding opportunities to pursue common-sense, pragmatic solutions that will help reduce the cost of living … create jobs and usher in a golden era of American prosperity.”

Environmental and public health groups called the rollbacks dangerous and vowed to challenge the rules in court.

Dr. Lisa Patel, a pediatrician and executive director of the Medical Society Consortium on Climate & Health, called the proposals “yet another in a series of attacks” by the Trump administration on the nation's “health, our children, our climate and the basic idea of clean air and water.”

She called it “unconscionable to think that our country would move backwards on something as common sense as protecting children from mercury and our planet from worsening hurricanes, wildfires, floods and poor air quality driven by climate change.”

“Ignoring the immense harm to public health from power plant pollution is a clear violation of the law,'' added Manish Bapna, president and CEO of the Natural Resources Defense Council. “If EPA finalizes a slapdash effort to repeal those rules, we’ll see them in court.”

The EPA-targeted rules could prevent an estimated 30,000 deaths and save $275 billion each year they are in effect, according to an Associated Press examination that included the agency’s own prior assessments and a wide range of other research.

It’s by no means guaranteed that the rules will be entirely eliminated — they can’t be changed without going through a federal rulemaking process that can take years and requires public comment and scientific justification.

Even a partial dismantling of the rules would mean more pollutants such as smog, mercury and lead — and especially more tiny airborne particles that can lodge in lungs and cause health problems, the AP analysis found. It would also mean higher emissions of greenhouse gases, driving Earth’s warming to deadlier levels.

Biden, a Democrat, had made fighting climate change a hallmark of his presidency. Coal-fired power plants would be forced to capture smokestack emissions or shut down under a strict EPA rule issued last year. Then-EPA head Michael Regan said the power plant rules would reduce pollution and improve public health while supporting a reliable, long-term supply of electricity.

The power sector is the nation’s second-largest contributor to climate change, after transportation.

In its proposed regulation, the Trump EPA argues that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases from fossil fuel-fired power plants “do not contribute significantly to dangerous pollution” or climate change and therefore do not meet a threshold under the Clean Air Act for regulatory action. Greenhouse gas emissions from coal and gas-fired plants “are a small and decreasing part of global emissions,'' the EPA said, adding: “This Administration’s priority is to promote the public health or welfare through energy dominance and independence secured by using fossil fuels to generate power.”

The Clean Air Act allows the EPA to limit emissions from power plants and other industrial sources if those emissions significantly contribute to air pollution that endangers public health.

If fossil fuel plants no longer meet the EPA’s threshold, the Trump administration may later argue that other pollutants from other industrial sectors don’t either and therefore shouldn’t be regulated, said Meghan Greenfield, a former EPA and Justice Department lawyer now in private practice at Jenner & Block LLP.

The EPA proposal “has the potential to have much, much broader implications,” she said.

Zeldin, a former New York congressman, said the Biden-era rules were designed to “suffocate our economy in order to protect the environment,” with the intent to regulate the coal industry “out of existence” and make it “disappear.”

National Mining Association president and CEO Rich Nolan applauded the new rules, saying they remove “deliberately unattainable standards” for clean air while “leveling the playing field for reliable power sources, instead of stacking the deck against them.”

But Dr. Howard Frumkin, a former director of the National Center for Environmental Health and professor emeritus at the University of Washington School of Public Health, said Zeldin and Trump were trying to deny reality.

“The world is round, the sun rises in the east, coal- and gas-fired power plants contribute significantly to climate change, and climate change increases the risk of heat waves, catastrophic storms and many other health threats,” Frumkin said. “These are indisputable facts. If you torpedo regulations on power plant greenhouse gas emissions, you torpedo the health and well-being of the American public and contribute to leaving a world of risk and suffering to our children and grandchildren.”

A paper published earlier this year in the journal Science found the Biden-era rules could reduce U.S. power sector carbon emissions by 73% to 86% below 2005 levels by 2040, compared with a reduction of 60% to 83% without the rules.

“Carbon emissions in the power sector drop at a faster rate with the (Biden-era) rules in place than without them,” said Aaron Bergman, a fellow at Resources for the Future, a nonprofit research institution and a co-author of the Science paper. The Biden rule also would result in “significant reductions in sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides, pollutants that harm human health,” he said.

These strategic investments in advanced energy manufacturing, electric transportation, and electric grid resilience are powering job creation, revitalizing rural areas, and positioning South Carolina as a national leader in American-made energy. These clean energy tax credits are critical for businesses, like mine, here in South Carolina in order to maintain investment and continue growing the manufacturing base within the Palmetto State.

South Carolina’s power grid — like much of the nation’s — is aging and under rising pressure.

Demand from data centers, manufacturing expansions, and electric vehicles is expected to surge over the next decade. In South Carolina, the commercial and industrial electricity rates are 10.97 cents/kWh and 7.01 cents/kWh, respectively, and both are below the national average.

However, electricity rates are up almost 6% from the year prior. Reduced incentivized investment in clean energy infrastructure could lead to even higher prices due to a reliance on more expensive, traditional power sources. Strategic energy investments, supported by stable tax policies, will help us avoid future grid shortfalls, prevent the risk of rolling blackouts, and reduce long-term energy costs for South Carolina families and businesses.

Tax credits are not a new concept — they have been a bipartisan policy tool used for decades to support emerging technologies. From artificial intelligence to biotechnology, to government investments driving technologies like GPS and the internet, these investments have repeatedly demonstrated their value. Clean energy technologies are no exception.

In 2024, over 2,600 megawatts of solar energy capacity came online in South Carolina, equating to enough power to supply 325,640 homes.

Over the next five years, South Carolina is projected to add over 2,500 megawatts of solar capacity.

Retaining the existing energy tax credits will allow businesses in South Carolina to continue to develop and deploy renewable energy technologies which are vital to improve grid resiliency, promote greater efficiency that results in lower energy costs for everyone, and foster economic opportunities in our rural communities.

Energy diversification mirrors a sound investment portfolio. Just as diverse assets protect against market volatility, multiple energy sources safeguard against physical and cyber threats. In addition, if we’re manufacturing these technologies here in South Carolina, we are securing our energy independence by growing our ability to produce what we need at home and having greater control over our supply chain.

Businesses have planned with these tax incentives in mind and rely upon them for capital allocation, planning, and project commitments — all of which would be threatened by the whiplash of major changes to these credits or further restrictions.

We’ve already seen a taste of what this disruption can do.

Recent federal changes and uncertainty have led to an indefinite pause in the construction of the AESC manufacturing facility in Florence, a $1.6 billion investment that promised to create 1,600 jobs in the Pee Dee.

A full repeal of these vital credits would undermine significant progress made in clean energy innovation, economic growth, and national security, and likely cede jobs and progress to China.

Now it’s up to our elected officials on Capitol Hill to decide whether these clean energy tax credits continue as Congress intended in 2022.

These private and public investments will spur domestic production of clean energy technologies which will set the United States up to compete in the global clean energy economy and create thousands more in clean energy jobs that will benefit all South Carolinians.

South Carolina businesses are ready to build — ready to invest in local workers, modern energy systems, and secure supply chains. But we need policy certainty to stay competitive.

It would terminate tax credits for manufacturing for the wind industry in 2028 and for solar and batteries in 2032.
Analysts warn that the House bill would cut new wind, solar and battery installations by 20% compared with the growth that had been expected without the bill.
Nuclear power Meanwhile, the bill partially retains a tax credit for electricity from existing nuclear power plants.
Summing it up The conservative Tax Foundation estimates that the House bill would cut the Inflation Reduction Act’s clean energy tax credits by about half, saving the government $50 billion a year.","When it comes to energy policy, the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” – the official name of a massive federal tax-cut and spending bill that House Republicans passed in May 2025 – risks raising Americans’ energy costs and greenhouse gas emissions.

The 1,100-page bill would slash incentives for green technologies such as solar, wind, batteries, electric cars and heat pumps while subsidizing existing nuclear power plants and biofuels. That would leave the country and its people burning more fossil fuels despite strong popular and scientific support for a rapid shift to renewable energy.

The bill may still be revised by the Senate before it moves to a final vote. But it is a picture of how President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans want to reshape U.S. energy policy.

As an environmental engineering professor who studies ways to confront climate change, I think it is important to distinguish which technologies could rapidly cut emissions or are on the verge of becoming viable from those that do little to fight climate change. Unfortunately, the House bill favors the latter while nixing support for the former.

Renewable energy

Wind and solar power, often paired with batteries, are providing over 90% of the new electricity currently being added to the grid nationally and around the world. Geothermal power is undergoing technological breakthroughs. With natural gas turbines in short supply and long lead times to build other resources, renewables and batteries offer the fastest way to satisfy growing demand for power.

However, the House bill rescinds billions of dollars that the Inflation Reduction Act, enacted in 2022, devoted to boosting domestic manufacturing and deployments of renewable energy and batteries.

It would terminate tax credits for manufacturing for the wind industry in 2028 and for solar and batteries in 2032. That would disrupt the boom in domestic manufacturing projects that was being stimulated by the Inflation Reduction Act.

Deployments would be hit even harder. Wind, solar, geothermal and battery projects would need to commence construction within 60 days of passage of the bill to receive tax credits.

In addition, the bill would deny tax credits to projects that use Chinese-made components. Financial analysts have called those provisions “unworkable,” since some Chinese materials may be necessary even for projects built with as much domestic content as possible.

Analysts warn that the House bill would cut new wind, solar and battery installations by 20% compared with the growth that had been expected without the bill. That’s why BloombergNEF, an energy research firm, called the bill a “nightmare scenario” for clean energy proponents.

However, one person’s nightmare may be another man’s dream. “We’re constraining the hell out of wind and solar, which is good,” said Rep. Chip Roy, a Texas Republican backed by the oil and gas industry.

Efficiency and electric cars

Cuts fall even harder on Americans who are trying to reduce their carbon footprints and energy costs. The bill repeals aid for home efficiency improvements such as heat pumps, efficient windows and energy audits. Homeowners would also lose tax credits for installing solar panels and batteries.

For vehicles, the bill would not only repeal tax credits for electric cars, trucks and chargers, but it also would impose a federal $250 annual fee on vehicles, on top of fees that some states charge electric-car owners. The federal fee is more than the gas taxes paid by other drivers to fund highways and ignores air-quality and climate effects.

Combined, the lost credits and increased fees could cut projected U.S. sales of electric vehicles by 40% in 2030, according to modeling by Jesse Jenkins of Princeton University.

Nuclear power

Meanwhile, the bill partially retains a tax credit for electricity from existing nuclear power plants. Those plants may not need the help: Electricity demand is surging, and companies like Meta are signing long-term deals for nuclear energy to power data centers. Nuclear plants are also paid to manage their radioactive waste, since the country lacks a permanent place to store it.

For new nuclear plants, the bill would move up the deadline to 2028 to begin construction. That deadline is too soon for some new reactor designs and would rush the vetting of others. Nuclear safety regulators are awaiting a study from the National Academies on the weapons proliferation risks of the type of uranium fuel that some developers hope to use in newer designs.

Biofuels

While cutting funding for electric vehicles, the bill would spend $45 billion to extend tax credits for biofuels such as ethanol and biodiesel.

Food-based biofuels do little good for the climate because growing, harvesting and processing crops requires fertilizers, pesticides and fuel. The bill would allow forests to be cut to make room for crops because it directs agencies to ignore the impacts of biofuels on land use.

Hydrogen

The bill would end tax credits for hydrogen production. Without that support, companies will be unlikely to invest in the seven so-called “hydrogen hubs” that were allocated a combined $8 billion under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law in 2021. Those hubs aim to attract $40 billion in private investments and create tens of thousands of jobs while developing cleaner ways to make hydrogen.

The repealed tax credits would have subsidized hydrogen made emissions-free by using renewable or nuclear electricity to split water molecules. They also would have subsidized hydrogen made from natural gas with carbon capture, whose benefits are impaired by methane emissions from natural gas systems and incomplete carbon capture.

However it’s made, hydrogen is no panacea. As the world’s smallest molecule, hydrogen is prone to leaking, which can pose safety challenges and indirectly warm the climate. And while hydrogen is essential for making fertilizers and potentially useful for making steel or aviation fuels, vehicles and heating are more efficiently powered by electricity than by hydrogen.

Still, European governments and China are investing heavily in hydrogen production.

Summing it up

The conservative Tax Foundation estimates that the House bill would cut the Inflation Reduction Act’s clean energy tax credits by about half, saving the government $50 billion a year. But with fewer efficiency improvements, fewer electric vehicles and less clean power on the grid, Princeton’s Jenkins projects American households would pay up to $415 more per year for energy by 2035 than if the bill’s provisions were not enacted. If the bill’s provisions make it into law, the extra fossil fuel-burning would leave annual U.S. greenhouse gas emissions 1 billion tons higher by then.

No one expected former President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act to escape unscathed with Republicans in the White House and dominating both houses of Congress. Still, the proposed cuts target the technologies Americans count on to protect the climate and save consumers money.",https://images.theconversation.com/files/673080/original/file-20250609-62-1ee6mx.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C285%2C5578%2C2789&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,N,,2025-06-12 23:44:30.118621

These tax credits have helped North Carolina emerge as a top state for clean energy business investment.

“Our state’s clean energy economy is booming, and companies’ decisions to locate their clean energy advanced manufacturing facilities in North Carolina have brought jobs and opportunities to our state,” said Governor Josh Stein. “H.R. 1’s abrupt changes to these credits would jeopardize much of this investment, stifle the demand that many companies were counting on, and conflict with the goals of reshoring manufacturing that the Trump Administration has championed. H.R. 1 would weaken our economy, raise utility prices on consumers, and undermine our national security.”

Since the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 passed, more than $24 billion in clean energy technology investments have been announced across North Carolina. These announcements include batteries for storage and vehicle applications, solar panels, cells, and wafers, electric vehicle charging stations, transformers, critical minerals, and a wide variety of grid-enhancing products. These businesses already or will soon employ tens of thousands of people, in addition to the more than 100,000 people already employed in North Carolina’s clean energy sector. The U.S. House budget resolution’s repeal of these tax credits would threaten jobs in North Carolina and put billions of dollars in investments at risk.

Moreover, H.R. 1 could cause a significant cost in electricity prices for North Carolinians – a more than 13 percent increase for households and a more than 20 percent increase for businesses.

For each constrained reforestation potential map, we calculated the area of agreement (intersection) with our forest potential map, constrained reforestation potential map, implementation exclusions, and precautionary exclusions.","Natural climate solutions (NCS) are ecosystem stewardship actions that protect, manage, and restore natural and working lands to provide measurable climate change mitigation1, and have garnered increasing international and policy recognition2. Reforestation—the restoration of forest cover via tree planting, direct seeding, or natural regrowth in places where forests are absent but naturally occur—is especially promising because it is the largest and most cost-effective option for carbon removal1,2,3,4. However, there remains high uncertainty and controversy around where reforestation can be deployed.

Numerous global maps have been produced to identify areas where reforestation for climate change mitigation could technically and/or optimally occur1,5,6,7,8. Five high-profile global maps have been subjects of much criticism9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25: the Atlas of Forest Landscape Restoration Opportunities (FLRO) by Laestadius et al.6, the NCS reforestation map by Griscom et al.1, the Global Tree Restoration Potential map by Bastin et al.5, the Global Priority Areas for Restoration by Strassburg et al.7, and the Global Potential for Increased Storage of Carbon map by Walker et al.8 (hereafter FLRO map, Griscom map, Bastin map, Strassburg map, and Walker map). Common critiques center on (1) definitions: the assumptions that determine where reforestation technically could occur, (2) data: the limitations of the source data used for mapping, and (3) precautions: the failure to consider potential perverse outcomes. These critiques have led to vociferous arguments in the literature13,18,19,25 and media, leaving decision makers uncertain about the magnitude of global reforestation opportunity.

Definition critiques focus on the criteria used to delimit where reforestation could occur. Many of these objections are raised against broad definitions of forest that include open woodlands and savannas, where increasing tree cover reduces biodiversity and compromises ecosystem services9,10,11,19. Other criticisms address ecological factors like fire and herbivory, which can naturally limit tree cover but are often overlooked when defining where forest could occur9,11,13,16,22.

Data critiques often focus on the limitations of source datasets. For example, Fagan demonstrated that some maps over-estimate reforestation potential in arid biomes because land use/land cover (LULC) maps systematically under-estimate sparse tree cover, and thus erroneously target areas that already have sufficient tree cover17. Other maps use coarse-scale LULC products that poorly differentiate land uses within mixed land cover classes (e.g., cropland mosaic classes that include up to 50% natural vegetation)20. Finally, some reforestation maps use coarse biome designations which ignore heterogeneity within regions and potentially overlook viable reforestation areas11.

Precautionary critiques highlight that reforestation can have perverse outcomes and object to the lack of safeguards or practical consideration of those outcomes in reforestation maps. Maps that include croplands as reforestation opportunities are criticized for not sufficiently considering local food security in some regions, changes in food demand due to diet shifts, and/or leakage (i.e., conversion of ecosystems elsewhere for agriculture)20. Still other maps are criticized for failing to exclude areas where reforestation would exacerbate, rather than reduce, global warming due to changes in albedo9,13,21,26. Maps are also criticized for ignoring the equity implications of mapping reforestation opportunity in areas stewarded by communities with relatively low incomes and education levels, poor food security and health outcomes, weak rule of law and land tenure, and/or high reliance on subsistence agriculture14,15,18,24.

Despite these critiques, global reforestation maps are widely referenced and used in cases ranging from policy documents to scientific research. For example, Google Scholar identifies over 6000 total citations for the FLRO, Griscom, Bastin, Strassburg, and Walker maps, the Bastin map launched the Trillion Trees movement (1t.org), and the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) used the Griscom map to determine the maximum potential of reforestation as a climate solution3. These uses underscore the need to address critiques directly and improve reforestation maps using updated science and sustainability principles27.

In this work, we create a suite of global maps that (1) build on the strengths of existing maps, (2) address key critiques, (3) incorporate the latest high-resolution global datasets, and (4) demonstrate how areas of opportunity vary depending on different value-based methodological decisions. Rather than producing a single area estimate or conducting a prioritization exercise, we aim to provide multiple estimates that incorporate additional considerations so that decision makers can evaluate how much area is feasible and desirable for their reforestation efforts, given their specific circumstances.

Existing reforestation maps

To learn from and build on previous efforts to map reforestation opportunities, we conducted a review of the existing literature (see “Methods”) and found 89 studies published between 2011 and 2022 (see “Data availability”). We identified seven global maps, including four original maps (FLRO, Bastin, Strassburg, and Walker maps), a modification of the FLRO map (the Griscom map), and two applications of the Griscom map (refs. 28,29). We identified ten regional maps (including two that use the FLRO map), which mainly covered tropical regions. Finally, we identified 15 national and 57 sub-national maps, which occur in 10% of all countries (i.e., 20 countries). Although some areas have high coverage (e.g., states in Brazil’s Atlantic Forest ecoregion have at least 20 maps available), most countries must rely on global or regional products for estimating reforestation opportunity (Supplementary Fig. 1).

We found that reforestation maps are generally produced using a common process, regardless of extent (Fig. 1). First, forest is defined, typically using tree cover, canopy cover, or biomass thresholds. Next, the area where forest could occur is identified (hereafter, forest potential). For example, the FLRO, Bastin, and Walker maps use biophysical constraints such as climate or soil variables to model forest potential. In other cases, as with the Strassburg map, areas of LULC change (i.e., deforestation) are used to infer forest potential. Next, the maximum area where reforestation could occur within the forest potential area is identified (hereafter, maximum reforestation potential) by accounting for practical limitations to reforestation, such as existing forest. Many maps also apply safeguards to minimize perverse outcomes and further limit the area where reforestation could occur (hereafter, constrained reforestation potential). For example, croplands are commonly removed in this step because reforestation of these lands can affect food security30 and/or result in leakage31. Some analyses then use additional factors to further evaluate trade-offs and benefits or to prioritize areas within the maximum or constrained reforestation potential (hereafter contextualized reforestation potential).

Across the 89 reforestation opportunity maps, however, there is no universal standard for how spatial data is used for mapping forest potential, maximum reforestation potential, or constrained reforestation potential. These maps use 28 different types of spatial data to map where forest or reforestation potential can occur (hereafter suitability factors) and 22 different types of spatial data to map where forest or restoration cannot occur (hereafter exclusions) (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table 1). Deforested areas, croplands, and pasture are the most frequently used suitability factors (used in 20 or more maps) (Fig. 2). Urban areas and existing forest are the most commonly applied exclusions (used in more than a third of all maps), followed by water, croplands, wetlands, and barren lands (Fig. 2). Overlays used for mapping contextualized reforestation span the greatest diversity of factors (30 across existing maps) with neighborhood metrics (e.g., forest pattern and distance to forest), economic factors (e.g., opportunity costs of the non-forest land use), terrain factors (e.g., slope), and carbon sequestration most commonly used (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table 1). Sometimes the same factor is used as a suitability criterion, as an exclusion, and/or as an overlay in the same analysis (Fig. 2). For example, the Strassburg map uses cropland and pasture within the forest potential to identify the maximum reforestation potential and uses cropland and pasture productivity and yield to further prioritize areas within the contextualized reforestation potential.7

We compared the spatial overlap and agreement of the four original global forest potential maps (FLRO, Bastin, Strassburg, and Walker; we excluded the three global analyses1,29,32, which re-use these maps). Combining the areas identified as forest potential across the four maps results in 9455 Mha (million hectares), equivalent to 74% of global ice-free land area. Individual map estimates range from 6160 Mha (Strassburg) to 8682 Mha (Bastin) (Supplementary Table 2, see “Methods”). All four maps agree in 57% (5412 Mha) of their combined extent, but at least three maps agree in 77% (7246 Mha) (Supplementary Fig. 2). Thus, there is moderate convergence among products despite variation in how forest is defined: FLRO and the Bastin map use 10% tree cover threshold to define forests, the Strassburg map uses 15%, whereas the Walker map uses a potential biomass criterion (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table 2).

Among the seven global analyses, five provide original maps of reforestation potential (FLRO, Griscom, Bastin, Strassburg, and Walker; we excluded one global analysis that reuses Griscom28 and another that maps reforestation potential using future land use scenarios29). For identifying reforestation potential, the Strassburg map only identifies maximum reforestation potential (1537 Mha) (Supplementary Table 2). The remaining four global maps (FLRO, Griscom, Bastin, and Walker) go further and identify constrained reforestation potential (Supplementary Table 2). The combined extent of constrained reforestation potential for these four is 4288 Mha (34% of global ice-free land area) (see “Methods”). Constrained reforestation potential varies more dramatically than forest potential among products, with nearly a 3-fold difference in extent (678 Mha in the Griscom map to 2509 Mha in the FLRO map) (Supplementary Table 2). Further, all four maps share only 23 Mha in common (0.24% of combined forest potential area, and 0.9–2.7% of individual constrained reforestation maps), though at least three maps agree in 252 Mha (3% of combined forest potential area, and 10–30% of individual constrained reforestation maps) (Supplementary Fig. 3). This striking variation is due to differences in forest potential mapping described above, as well as whether pastures are used as exclusions, and differences in the spatial resolution, time period, and LULC definitions in the datasets used to exclude existing forest, cropland, and/or pasture (Supplementary Table 2).

Mapping forest potential

Given the issues with existing reforestation maps, we created a series of reforestation opportunity maps that addressed common critiques, beginning with improvements to mapping forest potential. First, we defined forests much more conservatively, as areas that can support 60% or more tree cover, to exclude open woodlands and savannas33,34,35. Second, because there is uncertainty associated with any one product, we used multiple lines of evidence to identify forest potential by combining the two global layers that mapped uncertainty around forest potential (i.e., the Bastin and Walker maps)5,8. We restricted forest potential to pixels where the Bastin map predicts at least 60% potential tree cover, the Walker map predicts closed forest, and both maps have low uncertainty. This resulted in a preliminary forest potential area of 2393 Mha. Finally, because the Bastin and Walker models overestimate forest potential in ecosystems with frequent fires13, we eliminated areas with two or more non-cropland fires during 2002–2022, under the assumption that fire frequencies of at least two per decade can substantially limit tree density (see “Methods”). This reduced the preliminary forest potential area by 150 Mha (6.3%). These three modifications narrowed forest potential to 2242 Mha (Supplementary Fig. 4 and Supplementary Table 2), or 26–36% of the area presented by the individual FLRO, Bastin, Strassburg, or Walker maps (Supplementary Table 2).

Mapping maximum and constrained reforestation potential

To map maximum and constrained reforestation potential, we filtered our forest potential map to places where additional forests could grow given practical constraints and safeguards. We used four exclusions related to implementation limitations (existing forest, open water, bare ground, and permanent ice/snow) to identify maximum reforestation potential and five exclusions as safeguards (croplands, built-up lands, peatlands, wetlands, and albedo) to identify constrained reforestation potential (see “Methods”, Supplementary Table 3). Except for permanent ice/snow and albedo, these exclusions are all commonly used in previously published maps (more than 12 uses). For all exclusions except peatlands and albedo, we used 10–30 m resolution global products that map individual LULC types (i.e., without mosaic LULC types) for 2019–202036,37,38,39,40 to address data critiques. Implementation exclusions remove 1937 Mha (86.4%) from the forest potential map, largely due to existing forest cover (1914 Mha or 85.3% of the forest potential area), resulting in a maximum reforestation potential of 305 Mha (Table 1). Precautionary exclusions remove an additional 110 Mha (4.9%). After we apply all exclusions, we identify 195 Mha of constrained reforestation potential (Fig. 3b and Table 1).

This area is 71–92% smaller than the constrained reforestation potential identified in other global products (Supplementary Table 2), and only intersects with other global products in 24–98 Mha (13–50% of the constrained potential in our map) (Supplementary Table 4). Our exclusions overlap with large areas (60–70%) identified as constrained reforestation potential in other products (Supplementary Table 4). In contrast, other global products missed substantial areas of our constrained reforestation potential because they used older or coarser resolution existing forest datasets with different criteria for forest occurrence (132–153 Mha, or 67–78% of our constrained reforestation potential) or used older and coarser cropland and/or pasture maps as exclusions (50–59 Mha, or 26–30% of our constrained reforestation potential; Supplementary Table 4).

Contextualized reforestation potential

We estimate that reforestation, if implemented in the constrained reforestation potential area, would deliver 2225 TgCO2e (teragrams of carbon dioxide equivalent) per year of net climate benefits for the first 30 years of regrowth after deductions for albedo26,28 (Table 1). The vast majority of this may represent additional climate benefit (i.e., would exceed business-as-usual forest recovery). When we calculate the ratio of forest loss to gain in one-degree cells using a 2000–2020 forest extent and change map38 (Supplementary Fig. 5), and use that ratio to proportionally scale the area and mitigation estimates in each cell, we approximate that reforestation activities would likely be additional within 169 Mha (88.7%) of the constrained reforestation potential and achieve 2086 TgCO2e per year (93.7%) of net climate benefit.

There are an estimated 98 million people who inhabit the constrained reforestation potential (Table 1). Because global maps can never fully capture the priorities of local communities, we did not attempt to prioritize areas for reforestation. Instead, we used additional overlays to help characterize what trade-offs and benefits might result within the constrained reforestation potential scenario. We clustered these into seven additional scenarios (Table 1) that subset the constrained reforestation potential based on practical considerations or on motivations for reforestation drawn from our review of existing maps and their critiques.

We created three avoiding social conflicts scenarios that sought to minimize the risk that reforestation results in injustices, displacement, and food insecurity for local communities. These three scenarios limit constrained reforestation potential to (1) countries where individuals and communities are likely able to influence decision-making through participatory or representative processes (high individual rights scenario, Supplementary Fig. 6a), (2) countries with indicators of land tenure (secure land tenure scenario, Supplementary Fig. 6b), and (3) areas without nature-dependent, vulnerable populations whose food and fuel needs may especially conflict with reforestation (low rural livelihood conflict scenario, Supplementary Fig. 6c). These scenarios total 121, 116, and 158 Mha respectively, potentially resulting in 1474, 1428, and 1591 TgCO2e per year net climate mitigation and affecting 49, 47, and 67 million people (Table 1). The three scenarios avoiding social conflicts intersect in 90 Mha (Fig. 3a, c).

We created two scenarios focused on achieving ecosystem services other than carbon sequestration: one limited to areas with high nearby forest cover (Supplementary Fig. 7a) where biodiversity outcomes may be high41 (161 Mha and 1777 TgCO2e per year net climate mitigation), and another limited to floodplain or moderate slope areas (Supplementary Fig. 7b) where water quality and climate adaptation benefits may be high42,43,44 (71 Mha and 814 TgCO2e per year net climate mitigation) (Table 1). These scenarios intersect in 60 Mha (Fig. 3a).

The final two scenarios limit the constrained reforestation potential based on government policies, either through protected areas (Supplementary Fig. 8a), where reforestation may be compatible with other management objectives and have greater durability, or forest restoration goals (Supplementary Fig. 8b), where dedicated funding, reforestation infrastructure such as tree nurseries, and other resources may incentivize reforestation. The protected area scenario has the smallest total area, mitigation opportunity, and population affected across all scenarios, at 6.3 Mha, 53 TgCO2e per year net climate mitigation, and 1.7 million people (Table 1). The national forest restoration goal scenario covers 106 Mha, 1665 TgCO2e per year net climate mitigation, and 57 million people (Table 1).

In general, we find it is hard to optimize for all factors. There are only 15 Mha where seven of the scenarios intersect (Fig. 3a) and 0.5 Mha where all eight intersect. However, multiple outcomes can be achieved. For example, the majority of the constrained reforestation potential (83%) occurs close to existing forest, where natural regeneration is likely and reforestation may enhance biodiversity41 (Fig. 3a). Similarly, the low rural livelihood conflict scenario intersects with 81% of the constrained reforestation potential (Fig. 3a), indicating that it may be possible to reforest substantial areas without negatively impacting the livelihoods of those most dependent on nature. The co-occurrence of more than half of the constrained reforestation potential in countries with restoration goals suggests there is both ample opportunity and political systems that could be conducive to enable reforestation at a broad scale (Fig. 3a). Further, even though it is difficult to meet multiple conservation objectives simultaneously (Fig. 3a), we do find 57 Mha in countries with a restoration commitment and where restoration is less likely to cause conflicts, given secure land tenure, rights of individuals, and high standards of living. (Fig. 3a).

Sensitivity tests

If we do not remove areas with frequent fire, forest potential and constrained reforestation potential increase by 7% and 24%, respectively (Supplementary Table 2 and Supplementary Fig. 9a), while if we use a 50% potential tree cover criterion (instead of 60%) to determine forest potential, then forest potential and constrained reforestation potential increase by 19% and 36% respectively (Supplementary Table 2 and Supplementary Fig. 9b). Using liberal criteria to define forest (>30% potential tree cover and lower biomass thresholds) and removing areas with frequent fire substantially increases forest potential (5095 Mha, an increase of 127%) and constrained reforestation potential (845 Mha, an increase of 333%; Supplementary Table 2 and Supplementary Fig. 9c). Using the same liberal definition of forest but without removing areas with frequent fire further increases forest potential (5788 Mha, an increase of 158%) and constrained reforestation potential (1135 Mha, an increase of 481%; Supplementary Table 2). Using alternative forest or cropland datasets as exclusions results in minor differences to the total constrained potential (1.8% and 6.6% larger area, respectively), but substantial differences in some geographies (Supplementary Tables 2 and 3 and Supplementary Fig. 10a, b). If we do not use croplands as an exclusion, constrained reforestation potential increases by 31% (to 255 Mha Supplementary Table 2 and Supplementary Fig. 10c). Finally, using different land tenure datasets in the secure land tenure scenario (Supplementary Table 5), results in 72–125 Mha of contextualized reforestation potential (62–108% of the primary land tenure scenario area; Supplementary Table 5). Thus, our results are most sensitive to the tree cover threshold used to define forest for forest potential mapping and maps of land tenure.

Global restoration mapping efforts, including reforestation maps, are used for estimating the overall magnitude of opportunity, supporting global policy development, and mobilizing resources to places with greater relative opportunity45. Prior attempts to map reforestation have faced multiple critiques11,17,18,20, potentially limiting those uses. By addressing those critiques, our analysis shrinks the area of constrained reforestation potential in previous global estimates from between 678 Mha and 2509 to 195 Mha, a 71–92% reduction (Supplementary Table 2). Reforesting this latter area would result in 2225 TgCO2e per year of net climate mitigation for the first 30 years of regrowth, or roughly 5% of the sum of global fossil fuel and land use change emissions in 2022, indicating that reforestation can still offer substantial climate change mitigation potential and remains the largest available carbon removal solution1.

These results unsurprisingly fall at the lower range of previous constrained reforestation potential estimates (Supplementary Table 2), largely due to our use of a conservative forest definition (closed forest and at least 60% potential tree cover) that excludes savannas, and our choice to incorporate fire data into forest potential mapping. Indeed, only 5–24% of the constrained reforestation potential identified in other global maps intersects with our forest potential map (Supplementary Table 5). However, we map a more comparable constrained reforestation potential area to the FLRO, Griscom, Bastin, and Walker maps (1135 Mha or 45%, 133%, 64%, and 122% of those maps, respectively; Supplementary Table 4) if we use more liberal forest criteria to map forest potential (open or closed forest and at least 30% potential tree cover; Supplementary Table 2). By strictly defining forest, requiring multiple lines of evidence, and accounting for fire when mapping forest potential, we limit our constrained reforestation potential to the areas most likely to support dense forest. We thus minimize potential biodiversity and ecosystem services conflicts associated with adding dense tree cover to grassy biomes11 and avoid fire-maintained and fire-adapted ecosystems. Portions of the constrained potential of other products (8–21%) occur in areas with frequent fire. Because we incorporate fire frequency into our forest potential map, we help to focus on locations where carbon storage is more likely to be durable46. We note that reducing fire frequencies in ecosystems with altered fire regimes resulting from invasive species or other causes may be a viable reforestation strategy that would be missed by our approach.

Our methods align with recommendations for right-sizing land-based strategies for carbon dioxide removal by applying sustainability safeguards related to ecological limits, biodiversity, land use competition, and human rights27. We acknowledge that our constrained reforestation potential is a substantial reduction from previous estimates and excludes specific reforestation opportunities identified in subnational, national, and regional analyses (e.g., reforestation of marginal croplands with limited food supply ramifications32), but our global approach is consistent with do no harm and conservatism principles developed to avoid perverse outcomes, inflated ambition, and misallocated resources for NCS projects47. Even without cropland or other precautionary exclusions (Supplementary Table 2), our results demonstrate that reforestation alone cannot meet the forest restoration targets set by IPCC (1000 Mha, as reported by ref.5) or in national forest restoration pledges (327 Mha)48. Broader approaches to forest restoration that are beyond the scope of this analysis, (e.g., enhancing carbon storage in existing forests5,8,49) would be required to achieve those goals.

Our work also illuminates substantial differences in the constrained reforestation potential presented in previously published global maps, which have only 22 Mha in common (Supplementary Fig. 3). Although the global maps use similar methods and produce relatively comparable forest potential areas, decisions regarding which exclusions to apply and the datasets used to represent those exclusions led to highly variable conclusions about the area of constrained reforestation potential. In contrast with existing global maps, we used a broader set of precautionary exclusions, including albedo and wetland exclusions, and used more up-to-date and/or higher resolution LULC products for representing exclusions. We acknowledge uncertainties for our estimates due to our assumptions regarding how forest is defined, which exclusions are appropriate, and which datasets are used to represent key exclusions, such as existing forest and cropland, as demonstrated in our sensitivity analyses. We provide spatial data and code for reproducing our analyses so that users can modify our methods based on their own specific set of assumptions, exclusions, and/or precautionary principles (see “Data availability” and “Code availability”).

Our application of a spatial additionality deduction improves on the non-spatial approach used in the Griscom map1. Globally, the rate of forest loss exceeds the rate of forest gain, but there are localized areas where forest regrowth outpaces deforestation (e.g., landscapes with cropland abandonment, Supplementary Fig. 5). If reforestation is intended to provide real and measurable climate change mitigation, it must occur above and beyond baseline forest recovery47. However, the best available data of baseline forest recovery remain limited and future research is needed to update the forest loss/gain data38 to longer time horizons, refine spatial resolution, and disaggregate natural and managed forest loss/gain50. We also acknowledge that patterns and rates of forest recovery can rapidly change in response to markets and/or governmental policies or incentives. Other future research to spatially attribute forest responses to these mechanisms would enable more robust additionality evaluation.

We incorporated multiple overlay factors that might help identify specific reforestation opportunities and guide reforestation decision-making (e.g., secure land tenure, biodiversity, and water quality benefits), because additional assumptions and motivations can reduce the area available (Fig. 3a, c). Depending on the factors of interest, there may be a substantial reduction in area relative to the constrained reforestation potential, with an even greater reduction when incorporating multiple factors (Fig. 3a, c). Lack of secure land tenure causes the greatest reduction in area relative to the constrained reforestation potential among the avoiding social conflict scenarios, emphasizing the need for continued progress in formalizing and resolving land rights and title15 and empowering local land users51. Similarly, different measures of land tenure status affect the area identified in the scenario (Supplementary Table 5), highlighting the need for continued development of land tenure information.

We acknowledge that the process of stepping down from a coarse filter, global analysis to identifying real reforestation projects will always require local or national data and incorporate factors that cannot be readily mapped (e.g., social, cultural, or economic considerations that influence landholder decision making52,53,54,55). Our review of existing maps highlights where finer-scale analyses are available and the types of spatial data those analyses incorporate (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. 1, see “Data availability”). Nonetheless, for most countries, global and regional maps are the best available starting point. Moreover, the maps we produced can be used to highlight areas that merit additional focus or refined analyses. New datasets related to reforestation implementation and opportunity costs56, soil characteristics32, wood fuel demand57, high-resolution poverty measures58, and carbon durability (e.g., changing fire regimes59) present opportunities for additional overlays. Agricultural productivity60, cropland type61, and food supply datasets62, in particular, may help identify marginally productive croplands that could be reforested without impacting local food supply or resulting in conversion of intact ecosystems to meet global food demand62. Pastures likely represent a large portion of our constrained reforestation potential, and improved, high-resolution pasture63 and/or livestock density mapping (as outlined in ref. 64 for 2000) will help clarify the extent of reforestation areas relative to other approaches such as silvopasture.

We demonstrate that global area estimates of the constrained reforestation potential for climate change mitigation are highly variable and are dependent on the criteria and data used for mapping. We used a conservative approach to mapping constrained reforestation potential, which applied biodiversity, ecosystem services, durability, sustainability, and precautionary safeguards and incorporated contemporary, high-resolution LULC datasets. Our resulting area estimates are substantially smaller but less problematic than previous studies, and we demonstrate how additional considerations may further focus where reforestation may be feasible. We argue that applying these conservative considerations to reforestation mapping for policy and practice better supports smart action towards meaningful and equitable climate change mitigation.

Review of existing reforestation maps

We conducted a literature review to identify existing reforestation maps, broadly describe their geographic extent and application of spatial data, and inform our global map (Supplementary Fig. 11). Our main goal was to broadly assess the availability and distribution of recent reforestation maps across scales, not to provide a comprehensive or systematic review. We used the Web of Science Core Collection database to identify an initial pool of 6637 English language journal articles, books, book series, or conference proceedings published between 1 January 2011 and 4 November 2021 based on a search of titles, keywords, and abstracts using the search term [“forest*” and (“map*” or “spatial*”) and (“regrow*“ or “restor*“ or “reforest*“)] in a basic search. We then used the abstract screening software Abstrackr65 to identify articles describing the creation or use of reforestation maps at global, regional, or national scales. We considered a publication to be relevant if it included a spatial assessment of where reforestation could or should potentially occur. We limited our scope to reforestation approaches using natural regeneration or mixed-species planting in terrestrial ecosystems and therefore excluded publications mapping afforestation, plantation or single-species suitability, and wetland or mangrove restoration. We excluded publications focused on describing past patterns of reforestation (i.e., where it has occurred) unless the article used the historical recovery to predict future potential. We also excluded publications focused solely on forest pattern and patch metrics, such as fragmentation, edge, and core area statistics. We stopped screening publications once Abstrackr’s learning algorithm predicted a likelihood of relevance less than 0.5, resulting in a pool of 211 potentially relevant publications. We supplemented this list with an additional 20 articles, of which we were previously aware and which did not appear in search results, including studies published in 2022 after our cutoff dates. We read these articles and conducted a final manual screening for relevance. We categorized the remaining 89 publications based on geographical extent (global, regional (i.e., at least three countries, but not global), national (i.e., 100% of one or two countries), or sub-national (i.e., not 100% of any country)); the type of spatial datasets used (32 categories, see Supplementary Table 1); and the application of those spatial datasets as a suitability (i.e., factors used to delineate areas included in the forest potential or maximum/constrained reforestation potential), exclusion (i.e., factors used to remove or mask areas from the forest potential or maximum/constrained reforestation potential), or overlay factor (i.e., factors used for further refinement or prioritization of reforestation potential). Additionally, we associated the extent of each analysis with the corresponding level 0 and 1 administrative unit or units66 (i.e., the country, countries, or state(s)/province(s) included in the analysis).

Forest potential mapping

As a first step for generating maps of maximum or constrained reforestation potential, we created a conservative map of forest potential using a process that leverages two existing maps, avoids areas of uncertainty, and incorporates additional spatial data related to fire frequency to address forest potential map critiques. Our forest potential map serves as foundational information for subsequent steps by identifying where tree cover could potentially occur. We identified two raster format forest potential products—the forest potential components of the Bastin5 and Walker8 maps—which met our requirements: (1) they could be used to distinguish between forest and savanna ecosystems, (2) they have higher spatial resolution relative to other forest potential products, and (3) they include spatially-explicit uncertainty data so we could account for pixel-level uncertainty (Supplementary Table 2).

The Bastin map is a continuous prediction of percent potential tree canopy cover at a map resolution of 862 m (meters) produced using a random forest model with climate, topographic, and soils predictors. The product includes an uncertainty layer of the standard deviation of predicted tree cover. The Walker map is a classification of potential aboveground and belowground biomass (AGB and BGB) into closed forest, open forest, and nonwoody systems. The potential AGB map is a continuous prediction at a map resolution of 500 m, also produced using a random forest model with climate, topographic, and soil predictors. Walker et al. combined the potential AGB model with an existing model of root:shoot ratios67 to estimate potential belowground biomass (BGB), then classified the AGB + BGB values based on bioclimate zone-specific biomass thresholds. Walker et al. produced a pixel-scale uncertainty layer of their AGB prediction as an uncertainty index (UI) representing the range of the 97.5 and 2.5 percentile bounds derived from quantile regression forests divided by the AGB prediction. We re-expressed the Bastin et al. potential tree cover uncertainty as a UI to facilitate comparison with the Walker et al. product at the pixel scale by converting the standard deviation of potential tree cover to a 95% confidence interval, then dividing by the mean potential tree cover prediction.

We created a preliminary composite forest potential map based on a pixel-scale comparison of the Bastin and Walker forest potential and forest potential UI maps after rescaling all products to a 1 km (kilometers) spatial resolution using bilinear resampling. We classified pixels as forest potential if a pixel was mapped as greater than 60% potential tree cover in the Bastin forest potential map, as closed forest in the Walker forest potential map, and with UI values less than 3 in the Bastin and Walker uncertainty maps. This conservative approach thus only maps forest potential to pixels where both the Bastin and Walker forest potential maps agree, and where both products have low uncertainty.

As a final step to map forest potential, we excluded areas that are likely to support fire-dependent grassy ecosystems in places where the climate could also support dense forest33. We used a 500 m resolution global monthly burned area dataset derived from MODIS satellite observations68 to map fire frequency for 2002–2020 by counting the number of burned dates (indicated by MODIS active fire observations and change in burn-sensitive vegetation index values). We rescaled the fire frequency dataset to 1 km using maximum value resampling. To further distinguish between fires in natural ecosystems and fires associated with land clearing and conversion or agricultural practices, we used a 30 m global cropland map agreement dataset for 202269 (retaining any pixel identified as cropland in three or more of the six maps evaluated for agreement) and a 30 m resolution global oil palm plantation dataset for 201970. We rescaled the cropland and oil palm plantation products to 1 km using nearest neighbor resampling to match the resolution of the fire frequency map, then removed areas that had 2 or more fires from 2002 to 2020 and that were not cropland or oil palm from the forest potential map.

To evaluate the sensitivity of the forest potential map to our criteria for defining forests, we generated four alternative forest potential maps using identical methods except for the following changes: (1) including areas with frequent fire (instead of excluding those areas), (2) using a 50% potential tree cover threshold in the Bastin forest potential map to define forest (instead of 60%), (3) using a 30% potential tree cover threshold in the Bastin forest potential map and closed forest and open forest in the Walker forest potential map to define forest (instead of 60% and closed forest only), and (4) using a 30% potential tree cover threshold in the Bastin forest potential map to define forest and closed forest and open forest in the Walker forest potential map to define forest (instead of 60% and closed forest only) and including areas with frequent fire (instead of excluding those areas) (Supplementary Table 2).

Maximum and constrained reforestation potential mapping

The maximum reforestation potential map shows where it is possible to add forest within the forest potential map, while the constrained reforestation potential map shows where it is possible to add forest within the forest potential map while avoiding perverse outcomes. Our review of spatial datasets used in existing reforestation maps informed our selection of spatial datasets that served as exclusions. We used these datasets to exclude areas from our forest potential map and thus create the maximum and constrained reforestation potential maps. We used implementation exclusions (existing forest, open water, bare ground, and permanent ice/snow) to map maximum reforestation potential, and precautionary exclusions (croplands, built-up lands, peatlands, wetlands, and albedo) to map constrained reforestation potential. Supplementary Table 3 outlines the source spatial datasets and specific pre-processing steps associated with each exclusion; all exclusion datasets are in raster format.

When excluding existing forests to generate the maximum reforestation potential map, we avoided the data critique related to under-mapping existing tree cover in dryland biomes17 because those systems were already largely absent from our conservative forest potential map. When generating the constrained reforestation potential map, we excluded croplands to address food supply and leakage concerns20,30,31. We applied the peatland and wetland precautionary exclusions to protect large soil organic carbon stocks that may be vulnerable to losses following the establishment of trees71,72. Additionally, we incorporated albedo as a precautionary exclusion to remove areas where the net climate benefit from reforestation is predicted to be negative due to albedo26.

As general pre-processing steps for all datasets, we reclassified each dataset to 1 (exclusion) or 0 (not exclusion) and rescaled to 30 m resolution using nearest neighbor resampling. We combined all implementation exclusions into a single raster dataset by summing the individual rasters and setting values greater than 1 to 1. We resampled this dataset to 500 m resolution using pixel averaging to generate an intermediate proportion-excluded raster for subsequent processing steps, then to 1 km resolution, again using pixel averaging, to generate a final proportion-excluded raster. We generated a raster representing maximum reforestation potential by subtracting the proportion excluded raster from 1 for pixels within the forest potential map. We repeated these steps for implementation and precautionary exclusions combined and generated a raster representing constrained reforestation potential by subtracting the proportion excluded raster from 1 for pixels within the forest potential map. The resulting pixel values from these steps indicate the proportion of each pixel where reforestation could occur. To report the area within the maximum or constrained reforestation potential, we multiplied the reforestation potential raster pixel values by their area in hectares.

To evaluate the sensitivity of the constrained reforestation potential to individual datasets used as exclusions, we generated two alternative constrained reforestation potential rasters using identical methods except for the following changes: (1) using a forest/non-forest map derived from radar satellite data73 instead of a forest extent map derived from multi-spectral satellite data38 for representing existing forests as an implementation constraint, and (2) using a single product for representing cropland extent37 instead of a cropland agreement map69 for representing croplands as a precautionary constraint. Use of radar-based forest extent maps follows recommendations for addressing the limits of forest extent maps in areas with low tree cover17. Additionally, we generated a version of the constrained reforestation potential without using croplands as a precautionary exclusion.

Overlays and additional scenarios

Similar to our process of identifying exclusions, our review of spatial datasets used in existing reforestation maps informed our selection of overlay data. Overlays include datasets used to represent the feasibility of reforestation within the constrained reforestation potential through additional scenarios as well as reference datasets, such as climate change mitigation and population estimates. These overlays are used to contextualize the constrained reforestation potential and scenario results. Supplementary Table 3 outlines the source, scale, and pre-processing associated with spatial datasets used as overlays.

As general pre-processing steps for all scenario overlays, we converted all source datasets to raster format and set values to 1 to represent features of interest. For the slope and landform datasets used in the water quality scenario, we resampled the 90 m source rasters to 30 m and reprocessed the exclusion datasets to reclassify all pixels outside of moderate slope or floodplain areas as exclusions (see “Maximum and constrained reforestation potential mapping”). Except for the forest neighborhood dataset, we generated all other scenario datasets at 500 m resolution and applied them to the intermediate 500 m proportion excluded raster (see “Maximum and constrained reforestation potential mapping”), reclassifying all pixels outside the scenario overlays as exclusions. We generated forest neighborhood datasets at 1 km resolution and applied them to the 1 km proportion excluded raster (see “Maximum and constrained reforestation potential mapping”), and reclassified all pixels outside the scenario overlay as exclusions. We then generated the final scenario maps and area summaries using methods for maximum and constrained reforestation potential mapping described above.

For the climate change mitigation and population overlays, we reprojected these 1 km datasets to match the 1 km maximum and constrained reforestation potential. We estimated the annual net climate change mitigation for the maximum and constrained reforestation potential and scenarios as TgCO2e per year by multiplying the maximum and constrained reforestation potential raster pixel values (proportion of each pixel where reforestation could occur) by their area (hectares) by the per-pixel AGB and BGB sequestration potential during the first 30 years of natural regrowth28 with an offset to account for albedo effects26 (TgCO2e per hectare per year). We estimated the total human population directly affected by the maximum and constrained reforestation potential and each scenario (i.e., inhabiting the area) by multiplying the maximum and constrained reforestation potential raster pixel values (proportion of each pixel where reforestation could occur) by a per-pixel estimate of human population in 202074.

To evaluate additionality, we summarized the total area of forest loss and forest gain for 2000–202036 for one-degree cells, calculated a per-cell loss:gain ratio with maximum value set to 1, and used the loss:gain ratio as a multiplier for the per-cell constrained reforestation potential area and climate change mitigation values. We then summed all cell areas and net mitigation estimates.

We generated four alternative scenarios to evaluate the sensitivity of the secure land tenure scenario to our choice of dataset for representing tenure security. These alternative scenarios are described in detail in Supplementary Table 5.

Comparison with existing products

We compared agreement and described the maximum extent of the four original global forest potential maps (FLRO, Bastin, Strassburg, and Walker, Supplementary Table 2; we excluded Griscom et al., Cook-Patton et al., and Zheng et al. from comparison because those analyses are derived from FLRO). We reclassified each original map based on the forest definitions applied in the respective publication (Supplementary Table 2). For the FLRO map, we retained pixels classified as potential woodlands, open forests, or closed forests. For the Bastin map, we retained pixels with a potential tree cover greater than 10%. For the Strassburg map, we retained any pixels with a dominant original ecosystem type of forest. For the Walker map, we retained any pixels classified as closed forest or open forest. We then compared the maximum extent and agreement of the four original global constrained reforestation potential maps (FLRO, Griscom, Bastin, and Walker; Supplementary Table 2). We evaluated the Strassburg maximum reforestation potential map separately (described below) and excluded Cook-Patton et al. and Zheng et al. from comparison because those analyses are derived from Griscom. We also reclassified each product according to each publication’s definition of constrained reforestation potential (Supplementary Table 2). When publications subdivided reforestation using multiple forest definitions (e.g., by different potential tree canopy thresholds, as in FLRO), we used the broadest definition presented in the publication. For FLRO, we retained pixels classified as wide-scale, mosaic, or remote restoration; for Griscom, we retained pixels identified with reforestation as an NCS; for Bastin, we retained pixels with tree cover restoration greater than 10% and without existing tree cover greater than 10%; and for Walker, we retained pixels mapped with an NCS opportunity as restore/high suitability for forestry-based NCS or restore/low suitability for forestry-based NCS.

To calculate the global area of map agreement, we reclassified all retained pixel values to 1 (otherwise to 0), rescaled the resulting maps to 500 m using nearest neighbor resampling, summed all reclassified and rescaled products, and summarized the global area by agreement count. For each forest potential map, we also calculated the area of agreement (intersection) with our forest potential map. For each constrained reforestation potential map, we calculated the area of agreement (intersection) with our forest potential map, constrained reforestation potential map, implementation exclusions, and precautionary exclusions. For the exclusions used to generate the Bastin and Walker constrained reforestation potential maps, we also calculated the area of agreement (intersection) with our forest potential map, constrained reforestation potential map, implementation exclusions, and precautionary exclusions. For the Strassburg forest restoration map, we identified the maximum reforestation potential by retaining pixels with a restoration opportunity greater than 50% of pixel area and with a dominant original ecosystem type of forest. We calculated the area of agreement of this map with our maximum reforestation potential map and implementation exclusions.

We conducted all spatial data analysis using Google Earth Engine75, Python version 3.11.8, and the arcpy library, or R version 4.4.1 and the terra library. We conducted all tabular analysis using the tidyverse R library. We generated all figures using ArcGIS Pro version 3.3.176 or the ggplot2 and upsetr R libraries. Country boundaries in all map figures are sourced from GADM66 (https://gadm.org).

The Honeywell facility violated monitoring requirements for its industrial flare system, failing to operate required monitors and analyzers at least 95 percent of the time when the flare was operational over a rolling 12-month period. The British thermal unit analyzer for Flare M-1 experienced nearly 100 percent downtime from December 1, 2020, through August 31, 2022, according to the commission's violation information.

This equipment failure resulted in the flare being monitored less than the required 95 percent threshold for all 12-month periods ending from December 2020 through August 2022.

The violations involved multiple regulatory requirements, including sections of the Texas Administrative Code, New Source Review Permit conditions, Federal Operating Permit terms, and the Texas Health and Safety Code.

Under the enforcement order, Honeywell must implement measures and procedures within 30 days to ensure monitors and analyzers operate at least 95 percent of the time when the flare is operational. The company also must submit written certification demonstrating compliance within 45 days.

Of the total $33,337 penalty assessed against Honeywell, the commission deferred $6,667 for expedited settlement, with $26,670 paid to the state's general revenue fund. No additional amount is due to the state.

That would be a disaster for the economy just as clean energy is taking off.","Washington, D.C. – Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) today spoke on the Senate floor on Donald Trump and Republicans’ “Big, Beautiful Bill” which would have drastic effects on the U.S. economy by killing over 800,000 clean energy jobs, forcing the U.S. to be dependent on China, sending energy jobs overseas and adding an additional $170 billion in energy costs on American households. Below are Senator Schumer’s remarks, which can also be viewed here:

This week, Republicans continue their tortured efforts to ram Donald Trump’s “Big, Beautiful Bill” through the Senate.

Now some Senate Republicans are starting to balk at the fact that their bill is a clean job killer. It virtually ends all of the tax credits that we gave to wind, solar, and other clean energy.

If Senate Republicans have any desire to lower energy costs, and avoid shipping energy jobs overseas, they should hit the eject button on this “Big, Beautiful Bill” and start over.

Experts from across the political spectrum are starting to agree Donald Trump’s bill is far too radical and deeply flawed. And to boot, it was passed in the dark of night, when even many Republicans didn't know what's in it. A few even admitted that publicly.

On jobs, their bill will kill over 800,000 good-paying clean energy jobs by 2030 alone.

That would be a disaster for the economy just as clean energy is taking off.

These jobs will last for generations. Clean energy tax credits made them possible. And 85% of the investments generated by these tax credits have gone to red [districts].

Did you hear that, Republican colleagues? If Republicans proceed with the bill, they will put Americans out of work in their own states. And the American people, and these workers in particular, are starting to see it.

Just last week, a battery plant in South Carolina paused a billion-dollar project because of “policy uncertainty” – in other words, because of Republican sabotage.

And the closure in South Carolina is a canary in the coal mine if there ever was one: if Donald Trump’s bill passes, more jobs disappear.

And talk about costs – [we thought it was] going to add $32 billion on household energy costs.

And today we got the news that Donald Trump’s bill is worse than we thought: Americans will now pay up to $170 billion – not $32 billion – more on energy.

Let me say that again: $170 billion more for the American consumer to pay on electric bills, for small business to pay on electric bills. Republicans, because they just want to so embrace the radical, anti-clean energy fossil fuel group, will raise Americans' costs by a dramatic amount.

They also make us dependent on China. China is gaining in solar energy. If we cut it off, China will dominate the world, and our children and grandchildren will be at China's behest.

It will push about $80 billion in solar and battery manufacturing jobs overseas. More jobs in Chengdu. Fewer in Cleveland and Charleston.

We all know AI and crypto are going to cause American energy demand to spike massively in the coming years. Why the heck cut off one of the sources?

There are many who say all of the above. Okay, but why cut off one part of that all of the above because the radicals – not the mainstream but the radicals – in the fossil fuel industry are almost religious in their hatred of clean energy, because they know it is the future and will eventually displace them?

And that's why this week, I have been working 24/7 with so many different people, whether it's workers or companies or governors, to spread the word how bad this is. We are asking all of America: if you don't like these provisions, if you think it will lose your job, if you think it will raise your cost, call your Republican senator and tell them to change.

Most of the Republicans didn't like it to begin with, but it was rushed through in the dark of night.

HB 14 establishes the Texas Advanced Nuclear Energy Office (TANEO) within the Office of the Governor.

Established as the central coordinating body for the creation, deployment and oversight of advanced nuclear reactor projects, TANEO will advise the Governor and the Legislature on how Texas can eliminate regulatory and financial barriers that preclude nuclear energy development in the state. TANEO is also required to develop a comprehensive strategy outlining its approach to fulfilling key priorities of the legislation, including the creation of both resilient nuclear supply chains and the socialization of nuclear energy benefits. This strategy must be presented to the Governor and the Legislature every even-numbered year, by December 1.

Additionally, TANEO’s Nuclear Permitting Coordinator will act as the primary point of contact for industry stakeholders. This office will help companies navigate local, state and federal regulatory requirements, identify potential sites for nuclear facilities, and advise on available economic incentives for nuclear energy development, among other duties.

HB 14 also establishes the Texas Advanced Nuclear Development Fund to assist companies with costs associated with nuclear energy projects. With an initial allocation of $350 million (with potential increases up to $2 billion), the fund offers the following financial support programs:

- Project Development and Supply Chain Program. This program covers initial development costs for companies that have submitted an Early Site Permit, construction permit or combined license. Eligible expenses which may be covered by the program include technology development, feasibility and environmental studies, site planning and infrastructure expansion.

- Advanced Nuclear Construction Program. This program provides funding for projects under review by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for specific construction-related expenses such as fabrication, installation, inspection and testing.

- Completion Bonus Grant Program. This program covers the costs associated with making reactors operational. TANEO, in coordination with the Public Utility Commission, will determine grant amounts that a project may receive based on the electricity output the reactor is expected to deliver to the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, Inc. (ERCOT) grid. (This bonus is applicable only for advanced nuclear reactors capable of ERCOT connectivity).

This legislation lays the groundwork for more efficient coordination between state government and the private sector, expediting project approvals and significantly reducing investment costs and regulatory hurdles. Although TANEO includes a sunset provision set to expire on September 1, 2035, the Legislature retains the authority to extend it—signaling that Texas is already thinking beyond the next decade when it comes to sustained support for nuclear energy. Likewise, a dedicated nuclear fund provides a unique avenue for both emerging and established companies to more readily finance their projects. Ultimately, HB 14 supports Texas’s transition toward a diversified energy mix, where nuclear energy plays an increasing role in driving economic growth and innovation.

Absent a veto by Governor Abbott, HB 14 will take effect on September 1, 2025.

SB 1535: Pursues Creation of a Workforce Training Program to Support Demand for Nuclear Energy Expertise

Senate Bill (SB) 1535 amends the Texas Labor Code to establish an advanced nuclear energy workforce development program. This initiative relies primarily on public-private partnerships to bolster higher education and leadership training in the field.

SB 1535 authorizes the Texas Workforce Commission—supported by the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board and the Railroad Commission of Texas—to design higher education curricula and certificate programs that “prepare students for high-wage jobs in the advanced nuclear energy industry.”

This legislation is critical to ensuring Texas has a robust talent pipeline to meet the labor demands of its growing nuclear industry in the coming decades. Nuclear energy companies will benefit from the education programs, reducing both long-term workforce development costs and the risk of operational hazards stemming from unskilled labor. It also has the potential to position nuclear energy companies as drivers of economic prosperity across Texan communities.

Absent a veto by Gov. Abbott, SB 1535 will take effect on September 1, 2025.

SB 1061: Streamlines Application Process for Amendments to Pre-Approved Uranium Mining Boundaries

SB 1061 amends Section 27.0513 of the Texas Water Code to streamline the application process for amendments to pre-approved uranium mining boundaries, helping companies avoid undergoing the full permitting process formerly required even for minor adjustments. Applications and amendments will be considered uncontested matters under the Texas Government Code if:

- the authorization pertains to each production area within a permitted boundary and includes a range table of groundwater quality restoration values for each area; and

- the specified restoration values for each production area do not exceed the upper limit of the established range.

SB 1061 supports Texas’s ambition to lead in the nuclear sector by amending or eliminating burdensome statutory provisions, contributing therefore to building an ecosystem favorable to competitive nuclear industry growth in the state. Particularly, it enhances the operational flexibility of both nuclear energy and uranium mining companies, reinforcing therefore a low-friction environment for investments across the nuclear fuel cycle supply chain.

Absent a veto by Gov. Abbott, SB 1061 will take effect on September 1, 2025.

Together, these measures reflect a deliberate and coordinated push by Texas lawmakers to transform the state into a national nucleus for advanced nuclear innovation. By addressing regulatory processes, committing substantial public resources and cultivating a skilled workforce, Texas is not just responding to industry trends, it is actively shaping them. These legislative actions underscore the state’s long-term vision for clean energy leadership and lay a durable foundation for the next generation of nuclear development.

Can it survive a loss of energy incentives?,Sean Wolfe,,,,,https://www.renewableenergyworld.com/solar/the-us-is-seeing-a-solar-manufacturing-surge-can-it-survive-a-loss-of-energy-incentives/,"The U.S. solar industry added 8.6 gigawatts (GW) of new solar module manufacturing capacity in Q1 2025, marking the third-largest quarter for new manufacturing capacity on record, per a new report.
Solar Market Insight Q2 2025 report released by the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) and Wood Mackenzie.
In addition to growing module capacity, U.S. solar cell production capacity doubled in Q1 to 2 GW with the opening of a new factory in South Carolina.
“However, our analysis suggests that the U.S. solar market has yet to reach its full potential.
The bill could also trigger “massive energy inflation,” raising consumers’ electricity costs by $51 billion nationwide, SEIA added.","The U.S. solar industry added 8.6 gigawatts (GW) of new solar module manufacturing capacity in Q1 2025, marking the third-largest quarter for new manufacturing capacity on record, per a new report.

The manufacturing surge comes from eight new or expanded factories in Texas, Ohio, and Arizona, according to the U.S. Solar Market Insight Q2 2025 report released by the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) and Wood Mackenzie. In addition to growing module capacity, U.S. solar cell production capacity doubled in Q1 to 2 GW with the opening of a new factory in South Carolina.

The report finds that the U.S. solar industry installed 10.8 GW of new electricity generating capacity in Q1, and solar and storage account for 82% of all new generating capacity added to the grid. However, new tariffs and potential changes to federal tax credits pose “significant business uncertainty for the industry and threaten its long-term growth,” SEIA argues.

Utilities in the Midwestern United States are tackling tough challenges posed by increasingly extreme weather, aging infrastructure, and an ongoing race to integrate renewable energy while maintaining grid reliability. State decarbonization laws add complexity to the process of bringing power generation online, and as utilities transition from fossil fuels to cleaner alternatives, they are simultaneously managing supply chain issues, labor shortages, and new cybersecurity risks. Service providers must modernize their infrastructure to satisfy increasing demand while keeping pricing affordable, which is a tall task for any-sized utility.

“Solar and storage continue to dominate America’s energy economy, adding more new capacity to the grid than any technology using increasingly American-made equipment,” said SEIA president and CEO Abigail Ross Hopper. “But our success is at risk. If Congress fails to fix the legislation passed by the House – which would render the energy tax incentives unusable – lawmakers will trigger a dangerous energy shortage that will raise our electric bills and stop America’s manufacturing boom in its tracks. The Senate still has time to get this right and secure President Trump’s vision for American energy dominance.”

SEIA added that economy-wide tariff uncertainty, new anti-dumping and countervailing duties (AD/CVD) on cells and modules from Southeast Asia, and potential shifts in federal energy incentives could “significantly hinder” U.S. solar deployment and manufacturing, risking energy shortages, job losses, and factory closures.

“The 10.8 GW of solar capacity installed in Q1 2025 represents a significant portion of new U.S. electricity generation, highlighting solar’s growing dominance in the energy mix,” said Zoë Gaston, Principal Analyst at Wood Mackenzie. “However, our analysis suggests that the U.S. solar market has yet to reach its full potential. The proposed changes to federal tax incentives, along with ongoing tariff concerns, could significantly impact this growth trajectory and potentially lead to energy supply challenges. It’s important to consider the critical role of solar in America’s energy landscape.”

SEIA and Wood Mackenzie’s forecast for the industry, which they say accounts for tariffs levied in Q2 but not potential roll backs of the federal tax credits, projects declining deployment nationwide. While the community solar forecast remained flat, all other segments saw their five-year outlook decline compared to last quarter, including a 14% reduction in forecasted residential solar deployment, and a 6% reduction in forecasted utility-scale deployment.

A separate recent analysis conducted by SEIA of the impacts of the House-passed reconciliation legislation projects an energy shortage for the U.S. economy should the bill become law. SEIA argues that if lawmakers don’t change course, 330,000 current and future Americans jobs could be lost, 331 factories could close or never come online, and $286 billion in local investments could disappear. The bill could also trigger “massive energy inflation,” raising consumers’ electricity costs by $51 billion nationwide, SEIA added.

If Congress cuts energy tax incentives, SEIA’s analysis projects that energy production will fall 173 TWh and the United States “will not be able to meet demand or compete with China in the global race to power AI.”

According to the Solar Market Insight report, Texas added more solar capacity than any state in Q1 2025, with the state of Florida surging ahead of California for second place. Of the top ten states with the most solar installations in the first quarter, eight were won by President Donald Trump in the 2024 election: Texas, Florida, Ohio, Indiana, Arizona, Wisconsin, Idaho, and Pennsylvania.",https://www.renewableenergyworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Hero-Page-4_Reliable-Manufacturing-1024x576.png,N,,2025-06-12 23:44:39.811726

In Michigan, GM will invest in Lake Orion Assembly in Lake Orion Township to begin producing gas-powered full-size SUVs and light duty pickup trucks starting in early 2027.
Other plants receiving investments include Fairfax Assembly in Kansas City, Kansas and Spring Hill Manufacturing in Spring Hill, Tennessee.
“Today’s announcement demonstrates our ongoing commitment to build vehicles in the U.S and to support American jobs.
Gretchen Whitmer and the leaders of the Michigan Legislature praised the move, saying in a statement that GM and Michigan have a long history.","General Motors on Tuesday evening announced plans to put $4 billion during the next two years toward its domestic automotive manufacturing, increasing U.S. production of both gas and electric-powered vehicles.

GM hopes to assemble more than 2 million vehicles per year in the U.S., focusing on plants in Michigan, Kansas and Tennessee.

In Michigan, GM will invest in Lake Orion Assembly in Lake Orion Township to begin producing gas-powered full-size SUVs and light duty pickup trucks starting in early 2027. GM said that move would help the company meet continued strong demand.

GM’s Factory ZERO in Detroit and Hamtramck will be its location dedicated to bundling the Chevrolet Silverado electric vehicle, the GMC Sierra EV, the Cadillac Escalade IQ and the GMC Hummer EV pickup and SUV.

Other plants receiving investments include Fairfax Assembly in Kansas City, Kansas and Spring Hill Manufacturing in Spring Hill, Tennessee.

“We believe the future of transportation will be driven by American innovation and manufacturing expertise,” said Mary Barra, GM chair and CEO, in a statement. “Today’s announcement demonstrates our ongoing commitment to build vehicles in the U.S and to support American jobs. We’re focused on giving customers choice and offering a broad range of vehicles they love.”

Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and the leaders of the Michigan Legislature praised the move, saying in a statement that GM and Michigan have a long history.

“I am grateful to GM for bringing more auto manufacturing back home to Michigan, protecting thousands of good-paying, union auto jobs,” Whitmer said in a statement. “Over the last few years, GM has grown their footprint in their home state, and I am proud that the state of Michigan has been a strong partner in helping them ‘build, baby, build!’”

Michigan House Speaker Matt Hall, R-Richland Township, thanked President Donald Trump for GM’s investment.

“This is exactly what we said would happen when he unveiled his bold tariff strategy,” Hall said. “While other politicians were paying out billions to build EV plants with small job totals, President Trump took the smarter path to bring back gas-powered production that will put more people to work and do it without handouts. President Trump took a strong stand to bring factories back to American shores and punish companies that shed American jobs to move their operations overseas. That plan is working.”

In its announcement, GM gave no indication that the tariff strategy being implemented by the Trump administration was a factor in its decision to make the investments.

Regardless, Michigan Senate Majority Leader Winnie Brinks, D-Grand Rapids, said the multi-billion-dollar investment would mean thousands of new auto jobs for the state.

“I am delighted by this news,” Brinks said in a statement. “Our hardworking and dedicated workforce, vibrant neighborhoods where people want to put down roots, and major advancements in economic policy make our state the natural place to make such a transformative investment.”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-89/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/gm-autoplants-1024x5751749671226.png?h=c12e0b96&itok=luWn_MkO,N,,2025-06-12 23:51:51.035520

in its proposed rule argues that no restrictions on emissions from power plant smokestacks are necessary because pollution from American power plants represented only 3 percent of worldwide greenhouse gases in 2022.
That’s because power plants account for a quarter of the greenhouse gases generated by the United States.
The Biden administration regulation called for the nation’s coal-fired power plants to virtually eliminate the planet-warming pollution that they release into the air, or shut down.
The proposed rule would also repeal a requirement imposed by the Biden administration that plants continuously monitor the exhaust from their smokestacks.","The Trump administration moved Wednesday to erase limits on greenhouse gases from power plants and to weaken restrictions on their other hazardous emissions, including mercury, arsenic and lead.

Lee Zeldin, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, hailed a “historic day” and said the proposed changes would unshackle the coal, oil and gas industries from “expensive, unreasonable and burdensome regulations” imposed by the Biden administration.

Together, the moves mark a major blow to efforts to tackle climate change and to reduce threats to public health. The power sector is the country’s second largest source of pollution that is heating the planet, behind transportation. The Trump administration is pursuing an aggressive agenda to bolster the production and use of fossil fuels, while also scrapping policies that reduce planet-warming emissions.

“E.P.A. is helping pave the way for American energy dominance, because energy development underpins economic development, which in turn strengthens national security. And, most importantly, the American public voted for it last November,” Mr. Zeldin said at a news conference at the agency’s headquarters in Washington.

He labeled efforts to fight climate change a “cult” and said the pollution limits written by the Biden administration were designed “to destroy industries that didn’t align with their narrow-minded climate change zealotry.”

Mercury emissions are a particular hazard from power plants that burn coal and oil. Those plants account for 44 percent of all mercury emissions in the United States, according to the E.P.A. Once in the atmosphere, mercury converts into methylmercury, which can accumulate in fish and other food. Exposure can cause serious neurological damage in developing fetuses and children, and has been associated with respiratory ailments and heart disease in adults.

The use of coal, the dirtiest fossil fuel, has been precipitously dropping in the U.S., replaced by cheaper natural gas. But President Trump has taken several recent actions aimed at trying to revive coal, and on Wednesday, Mr. Zeldin said the country needed to produce and burn more coal to meet rising electricity demand.

“We will use coal for power generation, to mine for critical minerals and to export to our allies,” Mr. Zeldin said.

But the E.P.A. in its proposed rule argues that no restrictions on emissions from power plant smokestacks are necessary because pollution from American power plants represented only 3 percent of worldwide greenhouse gases in 2022.

Analysts have called that comparing apples to oranges. That’s because power plants account for a quarter of the greenhouse gases generated by the United States. In 2023, U.S. power plants produced 1.5 billion metric tons of emissions — more than the total greenhouse gases produced by most countries in the world.

“The key rationale Zeldin is using to justify the dismantling of our nation’s protections from power plant pollution is absolutely illogical and indefensible,” said Gina McCarthy, a former E.P.A. administrator under President Barack Obama who also served as former President Joseph R. Biden’s domestic climate policy adviser.

“By giving a green light to more pollution, his legacy will forever be someone who does the bidding of the fossil fuel industry at the expense of our health,” she said.

In fact, the Trump administration’s own analysis found that the proposed repeal of carbon dioxide limits would result in a public health cost of $130 billion. That figure includes premature deaths, lost work days and hospitalizations for things like lung and heart diseases or asthma caused by exposure to power plant pollution.

The figure also does not include the economic costs of wildfire, floods, drought and other extreme weather that scientists say has been worsened by climate change. The federal government under the Trump administration no longer considers climate costs when writing regulations.

The Biden E.P.A. estimated that the rule controlling greenhouse gases from power plants would eliminate 1.38 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide between now and 2047 — equivalent to preventing the annual emissions from 328 million gasoline-powered cars.

Under Mr. Zeldin, the E.P.A. found that eliminating the regulations would save plant operators and the fossil fuel industry about $19 billion.

“The E.P.A.’s obligation is to protect public health and the environment, and this repeal doesn’t do that,” said Frank Sturges, an attorney with the Clean Air Task Force, an environmental group. “It’s wiping out the benefits of the rules on the books in exchange for very little changes to compliance cost for industry.”

Separately, the Institute for Policy Integrity, a nonprofit research organization housed in New York University’s law school, found that one year of the U.S. power sector’s emissions causes $370 billion in global climate damages and $56 billion in public health costs in the country. They also contribute to about 5,300 American premature deaths.

Industry leaders and Republican lawmakers from states that produce gas and coal, many of whom joined Mr. Zeldin for the announcement on Wednesday, said the Biden administration rules threatened their economies.

“Under the Biden-led E.P.A., we witnessed an unprecedented assault on our electric grid and our ability to meet the surging power demand,” Representative Troy Balderson, Republican of Ohio, said.

The Biden administration regulation called for the nation’s coal-fired power plants to virtually eliminate the planet-warming pollution that they release into the air, or shut down. To stay open, most plants would have had to use technologies that capture carbon dioxide emissions before they reach the atmosphere, and then store those emissions beneath the Earth’s surface.

Jim Matheson, chief executive of the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association, said the Biden-era rules were “unlawful, unrealistic and unachievable” and would threaten the grid.

“Today’s announcements are a welcome course correction that will help electric co-ops reliably meet skyrocketing energy needs and keep the lights on at a cost local families and businesses can afford,” he said in a statement.

Mr. Zeldin’s other proposed rule would weaken emissions limits for mercury, a neurotoxin that impairs brain development, from coal and oil-fired power plants by 70 percent, and would loosen limits on other substances like lead, nickel and arsenic by 67 percent. The proposed rule would also repeal a requirement imposed by the Biden administration that plants continuously monitor the exhaust from their smokestacks.

The E.P.A. has given the public 45 days to comment on the plans. Both rules are expected to be completed by the end of this year.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/11/multimedia/11cli-powerplants-lhgb/11cli-powerplants-lhgb-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-06-12 23:48:51.972986

One of EMPOWERment’s major housing initiatives is the Pine Knoll EMPOWERment Affordable Community Housing or “P.E.A.C.H.” Apartments, a $3.5 million ten-unit building to house low-income residents in a historically African American neighborhood.
“Using solar energy to lower the cost of living to help neighbors who need it is about the best use of solar I can think of.
The contractors submitted these plans to Duke Energy in July of 2024 and Duke Energy ran the underground service for the single meter in October of 2024.
But in February of 2025, Duke Energy told EMPOWERment that it would not provide electrical service because of the single-meter configuration.","CHAPEL HILL, N.C.–Nonprofit EMPOWERment Inc., represented by the Southern Environmental Law Center, filed a consumer complaint at the North Carolina Utilities Commission over Duke Energy’s refusal to provide electrical service to an EMPOWERment multifamily affordable housing complex that will be outfitted with rooftop solar to reduce energy consumption and lower electricity costs. These cost savings will allow EMPOWERment to include electric service in the cost of rent, further reducing the overall cost of living for low-income tenants.

“At EMPOWERment, we are experts in affordable housing, community organizing, and grassroots economic development. We are not solar experts. EMPOWERment added rooftop solar for its energy efficiency, health and environmental benefits, and lower costs for tenants,” said Delores Bailey, executive director of EMPOWERment Inc. “We’ve tried to resolve this conflict, but we have no choice other than file this complaint so our tenants can have affordable housing. Our building is at risk and ten families in our community are struggling with housing when they shouldn’t have to be.”

EMPOWERment Inc. is a nonprofit based in Chapel Hill that focuses on affordable housing. One of EMPOWERment’s major housing initiatives is the Pine Knoll EMPOWERment Affordable Community Housing or “P.E.A.C.H.” Apartments, a $3.5 million ten-unit building to house low-income residents in a historically African American neighborhood. The Pine Knoll neighborhood was originally created so that African American employees of UNC and the UNC hospital could live nearby. EMPOWERment wanted to further that same goal by giving people a place to live near where they work.

The P.E.A.C.H. Apartments are intended to serve Orange County residents earning at or below 30% of the area median income, many of whom are single parents working minimum-wage or near-minimum-wage jobs, typically earning between $11 and $16 an hour. Some potential tenants are currently living in unstable conditions—such as “couch surfing” with friends or family—which is a form of homelessness. These unstable living situations highlight the critical and urgent need to open P.E.A.C.H. Apartments and provide these individuals with safe, permanent housing.

“This came about because people who are already doing some of the most valuable community-building work out there found a way to use solar energy to lower the cost of living for our low-income neighbors,” said Nick Jimenez, senior attorney at the Southern Environmental Law Center. “Using solar energy to lower the cost of living to help neighbors who need it is about the best use of solar I can think of. EMPOWERment is absolutely within its rights here and it deserves electric service immediately.”

To facilitate the rooftop solar, EMPOWERment’s contractors installed a single electrical meter for the entire building, rather than an individual meter for each of the ten units. The contractors submitted these plans to Duke Energy in July of 2024 and Duke Energy ran the underground service for the single meter in October of 2024.

But in February of 2025, Duke Energy told EMPOWERment that it would not provide electrical service because of the single-meter configuration. State law allows master meters when utilities are included in rent—precisely EMPOWERment’s model for P.E.A.C.H. Apartments.

Ultimately, it became clear that EMPOWERment had only two options: rewire the building with ten meters, incurring major costs and months of delay, or file a complaint at the utilities commission seeking clarification of the law and requiring Duke Energy to provide service. Ten families—many experiencing hidden homelessness—are left in limbo, forced to juggle temporary arrangements, while a brand-new building sits empty, at risk of catastrophic damage from mold and mildew because Duke Energy refuses to provide service.

“We urge the North Carolina Utilities Commission to do what’s right: turn on the power, let these families come home, and support affordable, sustainable housing in our state,” added Leah Adeniji, deputy director of EMPOWERment Inc.",https://www.selc.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/SELC_Logo_Horizontal_Social.jpg,N,,2025-06-12 23:45:32.988192

Fossil fuels produced most of the energy. Natural gas, oil, coal and natural gas plant liquids such as propane and ethane supplied 84% of the energy.

Wind and solar power, though growing, combined for 2.5% of the energy produced. Nuclear and hydropower combined for 8.7%. Minor sources of energy included biomass and geothermal.

The EIA reported 2024 energy production in an online post June 9. The EIA measured energy output by British thermal units, a way to compare, for example, the energy in a barrel of oil with the energy in a cubic foot of natural gas.

The U.S. produced 103 quadrillion Btus last year, or 1% more than in 2023. Natural gas accounted for 38% of the energy. Natural gas has been the leading source of domestic energy production since supplanting coal in 2011. Total energy production in the U.S. has approximately doubled since the late 1960s.

President Trump has signed executive orders instructing his administration to remove barriers to producing energy from oil, natural gas, coal, hydropower, biofuels and nuclear plants. He’s also withdrawn federal support for offshore and onshore wind projects.

Blue states and climate change activists are suing Trump, claiming his energy orders will worsen extreme weather and hinder the development of renewable power.

The EIA report showed many sources of energy grew or held steady during the last year of the Biden administration, with coal an exception.

Crude oil production was a record 13.2 million barrels per day, or 2% more than the previous record set in 2023. Almost all of the increased production came from the Permian region that spans parts of New Mexico and Texas, according to the EIA.

The U.S. produces more crude oil than any other country. In 2024, net exports of oil totaled 1.7 million barrels a day. In 2005, the U.S imported 12.5 million barrels a day.

Coal accounted for 10% of the energy. The U.S. produced 512 million short tons of coal, the lowest output since 1964. Trump signed an executive order in April to reinvigorate “America’s Beautiful Clean Coal Industry.”

A federal lawsuit filed in Montana by 22 people — ages 7 to 24 — claims Trump’s energy orders will deprive the plaintiffs of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Climate change is causing the plaintiffs stress and anxiety, according to the lawsuit. One plaintiff planned to work on “transition planning in coal communities,” but will have to do something else, the suit states.

Oregon, Washington, California and 14 other states are suing Trump in Massachusetts over a presidential memo instructing federal agencies to pause issuing permits for wind projects. The directive has stopped most wind-energy development, according to the suit.

Washington leads a 15-state coalition suing Trump in the U.S. District Court for Western Washington. The suit alleges Trump’s orders have a “myopic focus on fossil fuels.”

The resolution Trump plans to sign, which Congress approved last month, aims to quash the country’s most aggressive attempt to phase out gas-powered cars. He also plans to approve measures to overturn state policies curbing tailpipe emissions in certain vehicles and smog-forming nitrogen oxide pollution from trucks.

The timing of the signing was confirmed Wednesday by a White House official who spoke on condition of anonymity to share plans not yet public.

The development comes as the Republican president is mired in a clash with California’s Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom, over Trump’s move to deploy troops to Los Angeles in response to immigration protests. It’s the latest in an ongoing battle between the Trump administration and heavily Democratic California over everything from tariffs to the rights of LGBTQ+ youth and funding for electric vehicle chargers.

“If it’s a day ending in Y, it’s another day of Trump’s war on California,” Newsom spokesperson Daniel Villaseñor said in an email. “We’re fighting back.”

According to the White House official, Trump is expected to sign resolutions that block California’s rule phasing out gas-powered cars and ending the sale of new ones by 2035. He will also kill rules that phase out the sale of medium- and heavy-duty diesel vehicles and cut tailpipe emissions from trucks.

The president is scheduled to sign the measures and make remarks during an event at the White House on Thursday morning.

Newsom, who is considered a likely 2028 Democratic presidential candidate, and California officials contend that what the federal government is doing is illegal and said the state plans to sue.

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, Energy Secretary Chris Wright and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin are expected to attend, along with members of Congress and representatives from the energy, trucking and gas station industries.

The signings come as Trump has pledged to revive American auto manufacturing and boost oil and gas drilling.

The move will also come a day after the Environmental Protection Agency proposed repealing rules that limit greenhouse gas emissions from power plants fueled by coal and natural gas. Zeldin said it would remove billions of dollars in costs for industry and help “unleash” American energy.

California, which has some of the nation’s worst air pollution, has been able to seek waivers for decades from the EPA, allowing it to adopt stricter emissions standards than the federal government.

In his first term, Trump revoked California’s ability to enforce its standards, but President Joe Biden reinstated it in 2022. Trump has not yet sought to revoke it again.

Republicans have long criticized those waivers and earlier this year opted to use the Congressional Review Act, a law aimed at improving congressional oversight of actions by federal agencies, to try to block the rules.

That’s despite a finding from the U.S. Government Accountability Office, a nonpartisan congressional watchdog, that California’s standards cannot legally be blocked using the Congressional Review Act. The Senate parliamentarian agreed with that finding.

California, which makes up roughly 11% of the U.S. car market, has significant power to sway trends in the auto industry. About a dozen states signed on to adopt California’s rule phasing out the sale of new gas-powered cars.

The National Automobile Dealers Association supported the federal government’s move to block California’s ban on gas-powered cars, saying Congress should decide on such a national issue, not the state.

The American Trucking Associations said the rules were not feasible and celebrated Congress’ move to block them.

Chris Spear, the CEO of the American Trucking Associations, said in a statement Wednesday: “This is not the United States of California.”

It was also applauded by Detroit automaker General Motors, which said it will “help align emissions standards with today’s market realities.”

“We have long advocated for one national standard that will allow us to stay competitive, continue to invest in U.S. innovation, and offer customer choice across the broadest lineup of gas-powered and electric vehicles,” the company said in a statement.

Dan Becker with the Center for Biological Diversity, in anticipation of the president signing the measures, said earlier Thursday that the move would be “Trump’s latest betrayal of democracy.”

“Signing this bill is a flagrant abuse of the law to reward Big Oil and Big Auto corporations at the expense of everyday people’s health and their wallets,” Becker said in a statement.

Cyclic Materials , a startup supported by Amazon, Microsoft, and BMW Group, plans to invest $25 million in a rare-earths recycling plant and research center in Ontario, Canada, according to a statement reported by Bloomberg. The facility, set to begin operations in the first quarter of 2026, aims to bolster North America’s supply of critical minerals amid rising global demand and China’s dominance over rare-earth markets. Cyclic’s technology extracts rare earths from end-of-life products like wind turbines, data-center hard drives, and electric vehicle components, addressing supply chain vulnerabilities highlighted by China’s export restrictions in retaliation to U.S. tariffs, Bloomberg noted. The company already operates a demonstration facility in Kingston and a processing site in Arizona.

What is the rare earth minerals tussle between US and China

The rare earth minerals issue between the U.S. and China centers on a trade dispute over critical minerals essential for advanced technologies, including defense systems, electric vehicles, semiconductors, and renewable energy. China mines about 70% of the world's rare earth elements (17 metallic elements with unique properties) and processes over 90%, giving it significant control over global supply chains. They also produce 85% of rare earth magnets used in electric motors and other tech. “Rare-earth elements are a $20 billion to $30 billion market globally, but they unlock multi-trillion-dollar industries,” Ahmad Ghahreman, CEO of Cyclic Materials, told Bloomberg. “We are creating a secure, local supply for these critical metals.” The Kingston plant is designed to process 500 metric tons of feedstock annually, producing rare-earth oxides for magnets used in EV motors, wind turbines, and consumer electronics. Feedstock will be sourced from Cyclic’s Arizona facility and a network of partners, with output supplied to companies like Solvay SA. The project aligns with Canada’s push to become a hub for critical minerals, supported by government incentives and growing interest from automakers and tech giants. Cyclic’s initiative could reduce reliance on Chinese rare earths, which account for over 80% of global supply, per Bloomberg. The research center will also develop advanced recycling techniques, positioning Cyclic to meet surging demand for sustainable mineral sources in industries critical to the green energy transition.

This announcement comes as a concrete response to the increased focus on adding new nuclear generation to U.S. energy resources.

As part of our ongoing series of articles regarding nuclear energy developments, the following provides a brief overview of the TVA application and recent federal and state law surrounding nuclear energy.

1. TVA Application

The TVA views its application as having broader implications beyond receipt of this individual permit. According to Don Moul, TVA President and CEO, “[t]his is a significant milestone for TVA, our region and our nation because we are accelerating the development of new nuclear technology, its supply chain and delivery model to unleash American energy…creating a path for other utilities who choose to build the same technology.”

The NRC previously approved an early site permit for the construction of SMRs at the Clinch River site in 2019, which included a certification that the site was usable for the construction of a nuclear plant from a safety, environmental and emergency planning perspective, but without identifying a specific technology. With this CPA, the TVA seeks specific approval for the construction of a GE Vernova Hitachi Nuclear Energy BWRX-300 reactor at the Clinch River site. The TVA has a targeted goal of generating nuclear energy by the 2030s. While this is the first application for approval of the BWRX-300 reactor in the U.S., GE Vernova recently announced that the BWRX-300 reactor has been approved for construction in Ontario.

Although it would not be generating energy for public consumption, chemical firm Dow, in partnership with engineering firm X-Energy, has also announced submission of a CPA to the NRC in Spring 2025, which has been accepted for review. According to the Office of Nuclear Energy’s announcement of the acceptance, the SMR would be used to power the Dow manufacturing facility in Seadrift, Texas as part of a demonstration project supported by the U.S. Department of Energy (“DOE”).

The TVA is similarly seeking strong financial support for its projects through the DOE’s Generation III+ Small Modular Reactor Program with a coalition of over a dozen other energy industry partners. This coalition is applying for the $800 million grant available through the DOE program.

2. Federal Developments

At the federal level, support for and removal of barriers to new nuclear generation has been a focal point of recent legislation and executive orders. The below provides a brief overview of key developments, which will be evaluated on an ongoing basis, including assessments of industry implications.

Nuclear Energy Innovation and Modernization Act (“NEIMA”): Signed by President Trump in 2019, the NEIMA was intended to promote advances in nuclear power plant designs, signaling an early focus on nuclear generation. The NEIMA required the NRC to establish a staged licensing process for advanced nuclear reactors and to create a technology-inclusive regulatory framework for licensing of commercial advanced reactors. The NRC was also given two years to develop and implement strategies within the existing regulatory framework for licensing research and test reactors. In connection with each of the above, the NRC was further required to provide intermittent progress reports.

Advance Act: Signed by President Biden in 2024, the Advance Act focuses on incentivizing competition through DOE-awarded prizes (including the grant under the Generation III+ Small Modular Reactor Program that the TVA coalition is applying for) and reducing licensing application fees, promoting microreactors through new NRC guidance and reducing cost for pre-application activities, encouraging placement of nuclear plants at retired coal plant sites, and focusing on U.S. production of high-assay low-enriched uranium.

Executive Orders: The second Trump Administration has continued to emphasize nuclear generation through ongoing executive orders. On May 23, 2025, the Trump Administration issued four executive orders, targeting different elements of the U.S. energy sector. Our recent article discusses the implications of these executive orders.

3. State Developments

At the state level, lawmakers are using a variety of approaches to allow for and incentivize nuclear generation.

Indiana’s Senate Enrolled Act No. 424 establishes a cost recover and filing structure for SMRs. Through Colorado’s HB25-1040, nuclear power is added to the State’s definition of “clean energy resources”, which would allow nuclear projects to contribute to the State’s clean energy goals and receive local funding. This spring, the governor of Massachusetts recently announced the Energy Affordability, Independence and Innovation Act, which, among other actions, would repeal the State’s requirement for new nuclear facilities to be approved by a ballot initiative. The Wisconsin State Senate recently passed SB 125 (currently sitting with the Assembly), which would require the establishment of a nuclear sting study to identify opportunities and sites for nuclear development.

Certain states like Minnesota have outright moratoriums on the construction of new nuclear plants but their lawmakers have begun reassessing those limitations. While they did not pass, two bills were proposed this spring that would either entirely remove Minnesota’s moratorium or specifically authorize the construction of SMRs.

4. More to Come

The TVA’s application signals renewed industry interest in nuclear energy generation, and combined with legislative and executive pressures, we anticipate many more developments in this area.

The House Republican bill would terminate the residential solar tax credit by the end of 2025.
Kenny Pfannenstiel, the chief operating officer at Big Dog Solar, an Idaho-based solar installation company, said that rooftop solar has lately grown popular in newer markets like Montana and Idaho.
The rise in interest rates has further squeezed the rooftop solar industry, by making it more expensive to borrow money to finance new installations.
Some in the rooftop solar industry say they have to focus on cutting costs.","Over the past two decades, more than 5 million U.S. households from California to Georgia to Maine have put solar panels on their roofs, drawing energy from the sun and reducing their electric bills.

But that could soon come to a crashing halt.

The big domestic policy bill passed by House Republicans last month would, by the end of this year, eliminate tax credits for homeowners and solar leasing companies that have fueled the popularity of rooftop solar. If it becomes law, it would lead to an immediate plunge in installations, analysts and companies say.

“This sets us back,” said Ben Airth, policy director for Freedom Forever, one of the country’s largest residential solar installers. “I’ve been in this industry 22 years and remember when it was only rich people, doomsday preppers and environmentalists installing solar panels on their roofs.”

One analysis by Ohm Analytics, an energy data firm, estimates that residential solar installations could fall by half next year if the House bill becomes law. Without the tax credits, it would take 17 years, on average, for homeowners to earn back their solar investments. A more pessimistic analysis by Morgan Stanley projects that rooftop solar demand could fall by 85 percent through 2030.

While Republicans want to curb tax breaks for other renewable energy technologies like wind turbines and large-scale solar farms, the consequences for rooftop solar could be more severe. Rooftop solar can cost two to three times as much per unit of electricity as large solar arrays on farms or in deserts, and the residential industry is more vulnerable to shifts in subsidies.

The Senate is now writing its version of the domestic policy bill, and solar executives have descended on Washington to plead for a more gradual wind-down of the energy credits. They note that the solar industry employs roughly 300,000 workers and that rooftop systems can help homeowners cut their electric bills.

Yet some conservative Republicans have made clear they oppose any restoration of tax breaks for renewable energy.

“Those God forsaken subsidies are killing our energy, killing our grid, making us weaker, destroying our landscape, undermining our freedom,” Representative Chip Roy, Republican of Texas, said on the House floor last week. “I’m not going to have it.”

The uncertainty is upending an industry that was already struggling with tariffs and high interest rates. Last week, Solar Mosaic, which provided loans to homeowners to install rooftop panels, declared bankruptcy. On Monday, Sunnova Energy, one of the nation’s largest rooftop solar companies, followed suit.

The latter change fueled a boom in solar leasing, in which homeowners don’t have to pay the upfront cost of a rooftop solar system that can run $30,000 or more. Instead, a company owns the panels and keeps the tax credits. The homeowner leases the equipment from the company and ideally, saves money through lower energy bills.

More than 50 percent of home solar systems are now financed this way, and the rise of leasing has made rooftop solar more accessible to less-wealthy households, as well as to schools, hospitals and small businesses.

The House Republican bill would terminate the residential solar tax credit by the end of 2025. And, in a last-minute change pushed by fiscal conservatives, solar leasing companies would be immediately ineligible for the investment tax credit.

The House bill would also forbid companies from claiming the tax credits if they use components from China, which dominates solar supply chains. Because that provision is so broadly written, many companies say it would effectively make the credits unusable.

“Catastrophic is a fair way to describe the industry impact” of the House bill, said Gregg Felton, chief executive of Altus Power, which develops solar projects on rooftops and parking lots.

If Congress slashed support for renewable energy, experts said companies would continue investing in large-scale solar arrays, since even without subsidies those plants are often one of the cheapest ways to generate additional electrons. Rooftop solar, which is costlier and requires more labor, faces greater risks.

Kenny Pfannenstiel, the chief operating officer at Big Dog Solar, an Idaho-based solar installation company, said that rooftop solar has lately grown popular in newer markets like Montana and Idaho.

“We see a lot of interest from people who want to control their own energy future, or who worry about the grid being available when they need it,” Mr. Pfannenstiel said. Once the tax credits were expanded, he said, “the economic argument for those customers to install solar and battery systems became a lot stronger.”

If the credits vanished, some customers might still want panels, he said, but the market “would shrink drastically.”

The ripple effects could be significant. If solar leasing companies go bankrupt, customers could be left in the lurch, with no one left to service their panels. Thousands of installers and electricians would find themselves out of work.

More than three dozen solar factories have opened in the United States in recent years, but some could shutter if demand slows.

Freedom Forever, the California-based solar installer, says that two years ago none of its equipment was sourced from the United States; today, roughly 85 percent is, including inverters made in Texas and Florida. That’s partly because of provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act that provided a bonus credit for using domestic components.

If the credits go away, “the industry will just go back to using the cheapest modules, which are typically made overseas,” Mr. Airth, the company’s policy director, said.

Electric utilities and some analysts say that rooftop solar users raise costs for everyone else, because solar households pay less on their monthly utility bills but still rely on the broader grid for backup power. That shifts the cost of maintaining the grid to other households, which are often low-income. (Solar proponents disagree, saying that utilities ignore many benefits of rooftop panels, such as avoided transmission costs.)

The fight has been especially fierce in California, the country’s biggest rooftop solar market. In 2022, regulators slashed the compensation that new solar households could receive for the electricity they produce. In the months that followed, rooftop installations fell 85 percent statewide, straining installers, manufacturers and distributors.

Even now, some officials are looking to cut support further, including for existing homes. “We have to re-evaluate how our current solar subsidy programs impact Californians who may not be able to afford solar-panel systems,” said Lisa Calderon, a Democratic state lawmaker.

The rise in interest rates has further squeezed the rooftop solar industry, by making it more expensive to borrow money to finance new installations. The Trump and Biden administrations also increased tariffs on solar components from China, which aids domestic manufacturers but makes panels more expensive.

Some in the rooftop solar industry say they have to focus on cutting costs.

Not only are rooftop systems more expensive than large utility-scale solar farms, but the cost of a home solar system in the United States can be three times the cost of a comparable system in Australia. Some analysts blame differences in permitting processes.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/11/multimedia/11cli-rooftop-solar-01-gljb/11cli-rooftop-solar-01-gljb-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-06-12 23:42:06.944479

WASHINGTON – U.S. Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum and Secretary of Energy Chris Wright, chair and vice-chair of the National Energy Dominance Council (NEDC) respectively, joined Yukio Kani, global CEO and chairman of JERA Co., Inc. and representatives from several U.S. LNG producers to announce the finalization of four 20-year agreements between JERA and U.S. companies to purchase up to 5.5 million tons per year of American LNG. The agreements, which are projected to support more than 50,000 U.S. jobs and add more than $200 billion to U.S. GDP according to S&P Global analysis, underscore President Trump’s efforts to unleash American LNG production and the significant role the U.S. LNG industry plays in strengthening the U.S. economy and bolstering global energy security.

The agreements include sales and purchase agreements with NextDecade Corporation and Commonwealth LNG, and heads of agreements with Sempra Infrastructure and Cheniere Marketing LLC, to purchase LNG from America’s Gulf Coast. The announcement is yet another major milestone for President Trump’s commitment to increase investment in the U.S. and unleash American dominance.

“This investment is a message to the world that American LNG is back thanks to President Trump and we’re leading on the world stage,” said Secretary Burgum. “I am proud to join Secretary Wright and JERA CEO Yukio Kani to celebrate this commitment that will bring in almost a quarter trillion dollars to our nation’s economy and support over 50,000 American jobs for our country’s LNG industry. America is no longer begging for foreign energy – we’re producing it cleaner, smarter, better, and more reliably than the rest of the world.”

“Today’s announcement of investments in American energy that will unlock nearly a quarter trillion dollars in U.S. GDP is a massive milestone and a bold demonstration of President Trump’s leadership,” said Secretary Wright. “More than 50,000 jobs, tens of billions of dollars in new LNG export infrastructure, and a more secure energy future is just around the corner because we have a President who prioritizes our nation’s prosperity and energy security. This is another powerful example of the growth of the U.S. LNG export industry over the past decade which is a boon to our allies around the world who seek to expand trade with the U.S. while supporting their own energy security.”

“Today represents a true win-win and we want to thank President Trump for his leadership and commitment to unleash American energy – both of which were essential to completing these Agreements,” said Yukio Kani, Global CEO and Chairman of JERA Co., Inc. “They reflect a strong commercial partnership between the U.S. and Japan, strengthen Japan’s energy security and reaffirm the U.S.’s leading role in the global LNG market. We look forward to continuing our work with the President, Secretaries Burgum and Wright, and their teams, in partnership with the Government of Japan and the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, on shared energy goals moving forward.”

BACKGROUND:

To fulfill President Trump’s Energy Dominance agenda, Secretary Burgum is cutting red tape and empowering energy producers in the Gulf of America to drill more than ever before. In Q1 of 2025, the Department of the Interior announced the disbursement of approximately $353.6 million in energy revenues to the four Gulf of America oil- and gas-producing states – Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas, and their coastal political subdivisions such as counties and parishes. In a significant step forward for American energy production, the Department of the Interior is boosting offshore oil output in the Gulf of America. New scientific studies from the Department of the Interior have found that there is 7.15 trillion cubic feet of natural gas in the Gulf of America—a 22.6 percent increase in remaining recoverable reserves. In May, the Department of Interior issued an amended bonding financial assurance rule, which will free up billions of dollars for American energy producers to use to lease, explore, drill, and produce oil and gas in the Gulf of America while protecting American taxpayers against high-risk decommission liabilities.

President Trump and Secretary Wright have been hard at work to expand U.S. LNG exports by removing regulatory burdens left by the previous administration. With President Trump’s leadership, the DOE acted on day one to resume the consideration of pending applications to export LNG to countries without a free trade agreement (FTA), in accordance with the Natural Gas Act. Under President Trump, Secretary Wright has approved approximately 106 (mpt/a) in non-FTA export projects, which ranks higher than the current LNG export capacities of the second largest global exporter. The DOE removed regulatory barriers blocking LNG exports, including rescinding a Biden-era policy statement that required LNG exporters to meet strict criteria before the agency would request to extend a commencement date for an approved project. DOE also removed a barrier that banned the use of LNG as a marine fuel to power vessels, also known as LNG bunkering. In May 2025, the DOE finalized the 2024 LNG export study showing key findings, including that the United States has a robust natural gas supply; exports increase GDP, expand jobs, and improve trade; and LNG exports improve national security.

President Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill will help advance this project by expediting permitting for critical infrastructure projects, including LNG export terminals.

A solar company, BrightNight, has announced plans for a ""photovoltaic solar energy generation facility"" on vast farmland with access along Tunnel Mill Road, State Road 62 and Westport Road in northern Clark County.

The Florida-based company applied for a 1,500 acre project on land zoned ""General Agriculture.""

BrightNight has already applied once before in 2023 and was denied.

This application details a project that is half of the size of the original plan. The fenced acreage was reduced from 3,800 acres.

RELATED: How Indiana's solar farm debate impacts America's energy crisis

The buffer zones between the solar facility and nearby homes, known as the ""setbacks,"" are over 4 times larger. Setbacks were expanded from 150 feet to 650 feet.

These changed occurred because Clark County changed their Unified Development Ordinance regulations, so companies had to tighten their footprint.

""You know it helps, but it doesn’t take away the concerns as a whole,"" said Christine Horsley, a resident against solar farms. ""Six-hundred-and-fifty feet in this case is still way too close.”

Horsley is pushing back on solar farms anywhere in Clark County, and cites environmental concerns like impacts to farmland and animals as the reason why.

“If this comes, this will be the beginning of the destruction of Clark County,"" Horsley said.

Resident Kerri Vaughn wants these projects to move forward.

“We found that [solar farms] are okay, we can still farm, and we were very excited about it. We had no idea it would be so nasty,"" Vaughn said.

She leased some of her own nearby farmland to another developer, Orion, several years ago to build another solar project. The status of this project is still pending.

“There are some people that will not be pleased. It will never be enough,"" Vaughn said about the project's opponents.

She said that while the setback extensions help neighbors who are not leasing land but are still in earshot, it does impact how much of her land she's able to give to Orion.

“When they came up with 600 feet, it pretty much negated my entire farm. When you have 600 feet all the way around, it pretty much just left a tiny little sliver of my farm,"" Vaughn said.

Horsely said ""you’re going to feel like you’re in a prison"" despite the expanded buffer.

She also believes homes in the area will be devalued.

She's pushing back against industrial solar on agricultural zoned land.

""Instead of fields of grain, you’re going to see fields of solar panes,"" she said.",https://media.whas11.com/assets/WHAS/images/bbe8351b-8a36-4e3a-9bf1-30a8ec99b750/20250611T213709/bbe8351b-8a36-4e3a-9bf1-30a8ec99b750_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-06-12 23:48:56.480037

From the May/June 2025 Issue

With its infrastructure, workforce, and geographic advantages, Louisiana offers boundless opportunities for new, expanding, relocating, and startup companies. The state’s appeal for investment is further solidified by ongoing development projects. Louisiana continues to be an ideal location for energy, advanced manufacturing, and process industries, while simultaneously fostering the growth of emerging sectors like life sciences and technology. From multi-billion-dollar liquefied natural gas production facilities on its coast to lumber mill modernization projects in rural areas, diverse investments contribute to the state’s economic vibrancy.

Business Facilities recently spoke with Governor Jeff Landry, who took office in January 2024, about the latest for business and residents in Louisiana and his administration’s recent actions.

Business Facilities: Please tell us about the business climate in Louisiana. What are highlights for corporate expansions and for those considering locating in the state?

Governor Jeff Landry: We have had an incredibly exciting and productive 16 months since I took office in January 2024, and my legislative agenda has been highly focused on improving the state’s business climate. We knew we needed to make transformational changes in order to stabilize our state budget and create a more business-friendly environment. Two big accomplishments for our state’s lead economic development agency were a top-to-bottom restructuring that empowered staff to more effectively pursue prospective opportunities, and the other was a special legislative session designed to overhaul our tax structure.

What we accomplished during that session was monumental. It reduced corporate and personal income tax rates, eliminated the franchise tax, and sunset most industry specific incentives and exemptions, allowing us to pursue a fresh and modern approach to incentives this spring.

Just two weeks after that legislative session, Meta, Facebook’s parent company, announced it is investing $10 billion to establish its largest artificial intelligence data center on former farmland in northeast Louisiana. (Thank you to Business Facilities for selecting this project as the 2024 Platinum Deal of the Year­­—it was quite the honor for us.)

The five months that followed have been packed with even more progress and even more wins. They have been busy. They have been rewarding. And there is more to come. I anticipate Louisiana will reach $50 billion in investment project announcements by the end of this summer, a record for our state, and a loud message to show the world that we have opened a new chapter in Louisiana.

BF: What are target industries in the state? Would you highlight a project or two that have chosen Louisiana, and what attracted those decision-makers?

Gov. Landry: In the past couple of months, we have had two project announcements that highlight other industries we are focusing on. On March 24, we announced Hyundai Steel Company is investing $5.8 billion to build a new high-tech, ultra-low carbon steel mill in the Greater Baton Rouge area. This plant will be the first of its kind in the world and the company’s first production facility in North America, underscoring Louisiana’s leadership in America’s manufacturing renaissance.

And on April 8, we announced CF Industries will build a more than $4 billion low-carbon ammonia facility—the largest of its kind in the world, by the way—that will produce 1.4 million metric tons of this important source of clean energy for customers on every continent.

The CF facility is an example of our all-of-the-above energy strategy, where we are welcoming new investment and opportunities in both emerging and legacy sectors. Hyundai’s investment shows that our skilled workforce and long history in manufacturing are fueling a sector ready to come roaring back to life.

BF: What role does the recently launched Louisiana Innovation division of Louisiana Economic Development (LED) play in your efforts to drive economic growth?

Gov. Landry: The Meta deal is a great example of an innovative project we’d like to see more of, and I think the data center equipment sales tax exemption the Legislature passed last year, along with having the lowest industrial electricity rates in the nation, has us primed for opportunity in the tech industry. I know we will see more of these kinds of investments.

But we also want to see more early-stage entrepreneurs launching their business ideas in Louisiana. In February, as we showed football fans why New Orleans is the greatest Super Bowl host city in the history of the NFL, we launched the division you’re asking about at a daylong event that brought together our emerging tech leaders and investors.

Louisiana Innovation, or LA.IO, is dedicated to high growth, technology-enabled startups built on top of our asset industries.

We have recognized that access to capital for these entrepreneurs is a major issue—prior to my administration, just .06% of business investment went to early-stage capital, compared to 3.32% in our neighboring Texas. In response, we created the Louisiana Growth Fund, which sets aside $50 million in public funding for co-investing in startups.

And Louisiana Innovation is participating in seven seed capital funds across the state, with plans to add more in 2025. With state and seed capital funds, we have more than $100 million available.

Louisiana Innovation is also focusing on coaching these new businesses to new heights, creating events that connect these entrepreneurs and potential investors and creating a new innovation framework that makes the state an attractive place to be for these high-growth small companies.

So, while we are working to attract the Metas of the world, or the “big, shiny things” as we often refer to them, this administration is putting an equal focus on building up the businesses born here in Louisiana so they can thrive here for many years to come.

BF: What are the key issues facing Louisiana in terms of business development, and what incentives and other programs are being emphasized to encourage retention?

Gov. Landry: As I mentioned before in discussing our historic tax reform, we seized on that opportunity to sunset our outdated incentives and start fresh. We did that because of Louisiana Economic Development’s new strategic plan, and we wanted any new incentives to align with the priorities set in that plan.

In the current legislative session, we are proposing a new high-impact job creation program that incentivizes qualifying companies to not just create jobs, but to also pay wages that are well above the average wage of the parish (also known as county in other states). Under this incentive, the higher the wage, the larger the benefit to the company.

We wanted to provide a pathway to ever-growing wages across the state.

Another incentive we are pursuing is funding for site development. In years past, Louisiana has not invested nearly enough funding to ensure that we can adequately provide the infrastructure needed to make a site viable for a company in the hunt for development parcels.

This year we have asked the Legislature to approve a new $150 million site development fund, something that we think will go a long way toward building that railroad spur or improving road or water access to a site. This in turn will streamline decision making for companies and allow them to do business at the speed of business, not at the speed of government.

LED is working on another bill that builds on the successful changes we made for that agency last year. When it is passed, this will further enhance our efforts on a complete top-to-bottom revamp of LED that streamlines a number of operations and provides the ability for LED to act with flexibility.

BF: What did job creation look like in Louisiana during 2024, and now into 2025?

Gov. Landry: I am proud of our job creation record. Consider this: In the past six months, our three largest projects—Meta, Hyundai, and CF Industries—will together create nearly 2,000 direct jobs and 5,400 indirect jobs. Overall, we’ve announced 39 projects that account for 3,890 new direct jobs.

The location of these jobs is key, too: The 1,500 total jobs that Meta is creating is in one of our most economically distressed areas of the state—northeast Louisiana, which is mostly rural. Three of the parishes (counties) neighboring the parish where Meta is under construction have close to double the unemployment rate compared to the rest of the state (which is in line with the national average).

I mention that region specifically because the high-impact jobs incentive I mentioned earlier is designed with distressed areas in mind. The threshold to create high-impact jobs is lower in distressed areas so that there’s more of an incentive to create jobs there. This ensures that distressed areas are well-positioned for economic wins as we create new opportunities for all Louisianans.

There are so many reasons to get excited about what is going on in Louisiana.

The momentum we are seeing is real, and I can tell you that based on the number of prospective inquiries we are getting, the world is sitting up and taking notice. We are currently tracking 188 distinct projects with a combined value of over $145.3 billion with the potential to create over 34,300 direct new jobs.

I don't see any scenario under which that utility-scale solar business collapses.""","The budget bill being debated in Congress could have serious implications for a lot of industries, but some are saying it could be a disaster for the residential solar industry.

Solar companies are already hurting from reductions in government subsidies, but a threat to eliminate the federal solar tax credit could be putting the industry on the verge of collapse.

Solar power itself is a proven technology with a lot of benefits to offer as a clean, renewable source of energy. But right now, a lot of energy is going into just keeping the business alive.

""I think the industry is going to go through some very hard times,"" said Severin Borenstein, faculty director at UC Berkeley's Haas Energy Institute.

He said rooftop solar has gone through a lot of changes in the last few years, with the State reducing how much solar system owners are credited for the energy they produce.

But lately things have been improving.

""2024 was back to 2021 levels, so they had really recovered from a drop,"" said Borenstein. ""But now, with what the Trump administration is doing, I think there's a lot of concern. There were already a lot of rooftop solar companies that had pretty tenuous financing and were having a hard time. And I think this is pushing some of them over the edge.""

He was talking about a Republican effort in the budget bill to eliminate the 30 percent federal tax credit given to people who install solar systems on their homes. That, along with the tariffs being imposed by President Trump, has solar industry insiders calling foul.

""It's really sad to see solar energy being caught in partisan crosshairs,"" said Brad Heavner, executive director of the California Solar and Storage Association. ""The sun is not Republican or Democrat. The need for more electricity is not Democrat or Republican. We need more energy in America and Congress has a role to play in making that happen.""

But right now, the role Congress is playing is to restrict rooftop solar, along with other renewable energies, in favor of older sources like fossil fuels and coal.

The effect has already been devastating, with solar companies going bankrupt across the country. On Monday, solar giant Sunnova Energy filed for protection and last week, Solar Mosaic, a major lender in the business, also went belly up. But Gordon Johnson, founder of a research firm studying the industry, said the companies may have brought it on themselves simply by the way they did business.

He said some misrepresented their costs to lenders in what he compared to a Ponzi Scheme.

""The solar industry in the US is in a state of significant disarray. And it's not something that could not have been predicted,"" said Johnson. ""They perpetually issue debt. These companies are always issuing debt. As soon as they can't issue debt, and they can't plug that hole of the actual cost of the system versus what they show Wall Street, they quickly go bankrupt.""

Higher interest rates and equipment cost inflation have also figured into the mix. One analysis found that, nationwide, more than $14 billion in clean energy and electric vehicles have been cancelled or delayed as a result. The prospects for the industry aren't good right now, but Joe Osha, an analyst for investment banker Guggenheim Securities, said rooftop solar should not be confused with the overall solar energy market.

""In megawatt terms, I can tell you that the residential solar business, as visible as it is, is only a tiny fraction of the solar generation that gets added into this country each year,"" said Osha. ""The vast majority of it are these large utility-scale solar farms. I don't see any scenario under which that utility-scale solar business collapses.""

That leaves residential solar twisting in the political wind. And experts are saying small companies that have been the backbone of California's solar revolution will have a hard time staying in business.",https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/06/12/66ea775d-5154-4315-9428-eae679e86dbb/thumbnail/1200x630/2fe9424ba0b56115ef8d0377cc312924/solar-panels-a-home-roof.jpg?v=d2f497bd9339ad99d2e0559414346698,N,,2025-06-12 23:35:39.715425

​“They will pay less to use the same amount of energy, and residential ratepayers will pay more,” he said.
According to EQ’s analysis of Duke’s latest filings with regulators, the fuel rider totals about $2.75 billion for the company’s two North Carolina entities, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Carolinas.
Of the purchased power portion, residential customers currently pay about 41.2%, and use just over 40% of the energy.
“A vote against this legislation is a vote to make all ratepayers pay $15 billion more in electricity costs,” Arp said.","Residential customers of Duke Energy in North Carolina could pay $87 million more per year for electricity under a proposal rocketing through the state legislature, a new study shows. The figure represents about a 4% jump in household bills.

The legislation, Senate Bill 266, would change how Duke distributes the cost of electricity it buys to supplement generation from its own power plants — significantly hiking the share paid by residential consumers and cutting the portion paid by industrial electricity users, like chemical manufacturers and textile mills.

The analysis shows the legislation is a better deal for industrial customers than the status quo, said Will Scott, Southeast climate and clean energy director for the Environmental Defense Fund. ​“They will pay less to use the same amount of energy, and residential ratepayers will pay more,” he said.

SB 266 is the latest version of a Senate-passed measure that would unravel the state’s climate targets. It was publicly unveiled moments before it was debated and approved by the House Energy and Public Utilities Committee last week, and received fulsome praise from Duke, industrial groups, and others in testimony.

On Tuesday, despite protests from clean energy advocates and some Democratic lawmakers, the bill easily cleared the Republican-controlled House and now returns to the Senate, also run by the GOP.

The study, conducted by independent analysis group EQ Research, has a narrow scope, homing in on the ramifications of just one section of the 30-page bill — the part that covers how purchased power is billed to customers.

“We were pretty laser-focused,” said Justin Barnes, president of EQ Research, ​“because that’s the analysis we could do with readily available information quickly.”

While Duke generates much of its own electricity from a fleet of fossil fuel and nuclear plants, it also contracts to buy some of its solar power from independent producers and purchases energy from other generators under certain conditions, such as when demand spikes.

Under current law, the entire cost of this purchased power is passed on to customers annually along with a charge for natural gas and other fuels. The utility divvies up the costs of this fuel ​“rider” between residential and industrial customer groups based partially on their peak electricity demand and partially on their overall energy use.

According to EQ’s analysis of Duke’s latest filings with regulators, the fuel rider totals about $2.75 billion for the company’s two North Carolina entities, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Carolinas. The purchased power portion is around $1.1 billion.

Of the purchased power portion, residential customers currently pay about 41.2%, and use just over 40% of the energy.

SB 266 eliminates any weight given to overall energy use in allocating purchased power costs, according to EQ, shifting charges from large industrial users of electricity to residential consumers. The result is that households would pay just under 49% of those costs while using the same 40% of energy, the group’s study found.

“It is not going to be a savings for us ratepayers,” said Rep. Pricey Harrison, a Guilford County Democrat, speaking against SB 266 on the House floor. ​“It is going to be an increase.”

The EQ study does not incorporate the potential effects of other parts of the bill, including alleged savings from eliminating a 2030 deadline by which Duke must cut its carbon pollution, and the impact to customers of allowing the utility to recoup some costs for power plants not yet delivering electricity.

Rep. Dean Arp, the Union County Republican championing SB 266, said last week in committee that erasing the 2030 climate target would save all customers a total of $13 billion by 2050. He said allowing Duke to recover plant-construction financing costs early would net them another $1.4 billion. He echoed those claims Tuesday on the House floor, rounding up the total savings by over half a billion dollars.

“A vote against this legislation is a vote to make all ratepayers pay $15 billion more in electricity costs,” Arp said.

But opponents of the bill reject the allegation that striving for more wind and solar energy in the near term will contribute to rising rates, an assertion stemming from an elusive study from the state-sanctioned customer advocate, Public Staff, that hasn’t been provided widely to legislators or members of the public.

Clean energy advocates say the Public Staff analysis considers only the cost of building new power generation, not the rising price of fossil fuels. And they continue to question the wisdom of allowing Duke to charge consumers for costs related to nuclear and gas plants that may never come online.

Perhaps above all, EQ’s findings show why more time is needed to vet the bill with all interested parties, including clean energy and consumer advocates, not just Duke and large industrial customers, critics contend.

“When we rush processes like these and don’t include all the stakeholders, we can end up with results that unfairly burden North Carolina households,” said Scott with the Environmental Defense Fund. ​“I hope that we can slow down and make the adjustments we need so that this bill doesn’t cause unnecessary pollution or unnecessary costs.”

But the House’s public deliberation of the measure has been anything but slow. In less than a week, it cleared two committees and two required floor votes. It could appear on the desk of Gov. Josh Stein, a Democrat, as soon as this week.

“There are all kinds of reasons to vote no on this bill,” Harrison said to the full House on Tuesday, including its treatment of residential customers, its abdication of climate targets, and the process by which it was rushed through the chamber.",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/GettyImages-532812141_2025-06-11-202139_krob.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=fc5c2518e6a8193d42b9c06e494819ab,N,,2025-06-12 23:45:40.834203

And it’s a tiny fraction of the generation that they intend to ride to energy dominance.
Clean energy is now, simply, energy.","As the House Republicans passed their and President Trump’s budget bill last month, some wanted to preserve — or at least have an orderly phase out of — various clean energy tax credits. The message they received, according to Politico: “When it comes to winning on clean energy, Trump just isn’t interested.”

Right now, renewables and batteries comprise more than 80% of the energy coming onto the world’s power grids, including in the US. They’re more than 90% of what’s been installed in Texas recently.

And electricity is at the center of China’s efforts to overtake the U.S. economy.

Yet Trump and the House leadership appear apathetic in their approach to this vital race with China; they seem to have given up. They talk about winning the AI race, but they are knee-capping the only power source that can, in the short and medium terms, deliver the massive amounts of electricity that AI and modern economies need.

They apparently think the U.S. can lead on oil and gas, coal, and nuclear power but not on solar, wind, electric vehicles, and batteries — the very sources that are shaping the future.

No one is building coal plants in America, no matter how badly President Trump or anyone else wants them to.

New nuclear power will take until 2032, at least, to enter the market, and longer to scale up.

And supply chain issues mean there will be a shortage of gas turbines for the next half-decade, and likely much longer.

Energy dominance is only possible with clean energy.

Yet Politico cites a former Trump Administration Energy Department official on clean energy: “To all appearances, it is not a battlefield that they care about.”

That’s not energy dominance. It’s the opposite: it’s energy submission. It will hand growth fueled by new energy innovation to China and hobble the American economy.

It also will drive U.S. power bills through the roof, which will hasten a change of power in Washington — making these policies that much more confounding. Regardless, such unpredictable, unstable policymaking is terrible for businesses and economic growth — economic growth we desperately need to get out of the debt crisis we’re in.

Senators need to change the House bill to work to preserve or gradually phase out the clean energy tax cuts as if our country’s economic prospects depend on it. Because they almost certainly do.

An “Electrostate”

The Financial Times recently dubbed China the “world’s first electrostate.” It’s a remarkable phrase, and the implications for power and control in the 21st century are massive.

The United States was brought to its knees by petrostates in the 1970s. Gas lines and a stagnant economy defined that decade. Middle-Eastern countries kicked off the energy crisis in 1973; it took more than a decade for a president to be re-elected.

China is building the same capability with electricity. The way things are going, if a country — or a company — wants more power, they’ll need to go through China.

More than 80% of the world’s solar panels and batteries are manufactured in China.

The country dominates supplies of critical minerals and is rapidly gaining in electric vehicles. This year, China will sell more than 10 million EVs domestically, making a majority of vehicle sales in one of the world’s biggest markets; Brazil, Indonesia, and Mexico all import more than 60% of their EVs from China.

From the FT:

China is on its way to becoming the world’s first “electrostate”, with a growing share of its energy coming from electricity and an economy increasingly driven by clean technologies. It offers China a strategic buffer from trade decoupling and rising geopolitical tensions with the US.

The country is not only rapidly advancing towards self-sufficiency in energy from secure domestic sources, but also wields vast power over the markets for the resources and materials that underpin technologies of the future. (emphasis added)

Dominance Starts with Competitiveness

The U.S. has started to turn the tide. Clean energy manufacturing here doubled over the last three years.

We now actually supply ourselves with about 70% of the batteries used in domestically manufactured electric vehicles. We could continue these investments and compete globally with China.

This is why the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, Inflation Reduction Act, and CHIPs and Science Act were so important, no matter what party you belong to: they helped the United States start to build stuff.

Our manufacturing sector grew significantly after the bills passed. Texas has seen massive amounts of solar and battery manufacturing — but not nearly as much as Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Tennessee, Ohio, Indiana, and Michigan.

By maintaining clean energy incentives in the One Big Beautiful Bill (OBBB) Act of 2025, Republicans could, if they choose, take credit for catalyzing America’s manufacturing renaissance and economic growth.

In a podcast recorded the day after the U.S. House voted for the budget bill (and against energy dominance, against economic competitiveness, and for higher power bills), All-In host David Friedberg said, “This generation's Manhattan and Apollo project is energy production scaling in the United States.”

That’s 1,000% right. So was his co-host, Chamath Palihapitiya, who noted that energy production scaling necessarily requires a whole lot of wind, solar, and storage. It also requires more geothermal, nuclear, and gas peakers, too, but those all take much longer to build, and we’re running out of time.

Whatever dream you have of the future probably requires massive amounts of power. Without renewables and storage, it will never be a reality.

Thinking in Terawatts

Americans simply aren't thinking big enough.

But China is.

Just a few weeks before Friedberg called for a Manhattan project to scale energy production, he hosted Doug Burgum, chair of Trump's National Energy Dominance Council.

Friedberg told Secretary Burgum that by 2040, China’s energy generation capacity is projected to grow from three terawatts to eight.

In the United States, projections have us going, maybe, from one to two terawatts:

Secretary Burgum said that’s what “keeps him up at night.”

But Burgum also claimed that China built 95 gigawatts of coal in 2024 — in fact, China started construction on 95 gigawatts and completed less than a third of that. And it’s a tiny fraction of the generation that they intend to ride to energy dominance.

To that point, Burgum failed to note that China completed 277 gigawatts of solar and 80 gigawatts of wind in 2024 alone.

That’s energy dominance. And that’s what should keep Burgum up at night.

That massive renewables growth added nearly half a terawatt of electricity — over 400 gigawatts — to China’s power grids last year. The country will likely exceed that in 2025.

By contrast, the U.S. installed a little over 60 gigawatts in 2024.

The United States’ entire installed capacity is about 1,300 gigawatts. So China is on pace to install an entire United States-worth of power in less than three years, and then do it again in the next three.

How is the Administration going to keep up? Here’s what Burgum told Friedberg:

“Between now, 2025, and 2030, a lot of it's going to come back to LNG because that’s the fastest thing we can get online for more electricity generation is LNG power plants.”

This is a direct quote. And it’s terrifying.

There’s no such thing as an LNG power plant.

Liquefying natural gas consumes massive amounts of electricity. The only reason to do it is to send it somewhere else. And that’s what the oil and gas industry is doing: sending liquefied gas overseas.

But there’s no world — no math — where a national LNG buildout does a damn thing to help power our electric grids to compete and win with China.

Only Burgum’s urgency was partially reassuring.

It seems like Burgum and the Administration want to compete with China, which is great. And he says he wants to do it by putting power on the grid as quickly as possible, which is also great.

But we’re not going to do that with “LNG power plants.”

The answer is obvious to anyone paying attention to global electricity markets: the fastest way to get electricity online is through solar power and battery storage — and there’s not a close second.

The Only Thing Missing is Power

If you don’t want to invest in renewables and batteries for energy dominance or national security, then you should want to do it for fiscal solvency and economic prosperity.

The biggest thing about the One Big Beautiful Bill might be the debt it adds to the nation’s balance sheet. Plentiful, cheap electricity — and the economic growth it powers — would make a huge difference. Here’s Friedberg again:

“If I saw us adding a terawatt of electricity production capacity per year in the U.S., I would shut the fuck up about the debt.”

Why? Because we could power new industries and generate massive amounts of wealth and tax base. Friedberg added, “The technology is here today. The only thing that's missing is the power.”

Yet building even a tenth of a terawatt requires a massive amount of solar, wind, and storage. Nobody’s building anywhere near that much gas power. GE Vernova, the largest manufacturer of gas turbines, is ramping up to make 20 gigawatts, or one-fiftieth of a terawatt, per year worth of gas turbines by 2027 — for the entire world.

By smashing renewables, the House’s budget bill would result in far less electricity just at the time we need a lot more — and because of the legislatively imposed scarcity, electricity, which we need to power every innovation that could help us grow, would be far more expensive.

The Senate needs to take us off the ledge the House put us on.

More than that, our country needs to stop pretending that some electrons are red and some are blue. Clean energy is now, simply, energy. It is the dominant energy.

Ceding this ground to China is not energy dominance.

It’s energy surrender.","https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1200,h_600,c_fill,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F26f519cd-1043-4d35-82c4-601977e6e9cd_1364x740.png",N,,2025-06-12 23:42:14.555347

“Power plants are among the largest sources of dangerous pollution in the nation.
We have modern technologies that allow these plants to reduce pollution with available and cost-effective solutions,” said Vickie Patton, general counsel of the Environmental Defense Fund.
Coal-fired power plants would be forced to capture smokestack emissions or shut down under a strict EPA rule issued last year.
“Carbon emissions in the power sector drop at a faster rate with the (Biden-era) rules in place than without them,” Bergman said in an email.","WASHINGTON (AP) — The Environmental Protection Agency is poised to eliminate rules that limit greenhouse gas emissions from power plants fueled by coal and natural gas, part of a wide-ranging rollback of environmental regulations that Administrator Lee Zeldin has said would remove trillions of dollars in costs and “unleash” American energy.

The EPA also plans to weaken a regulation that requires power plants to reduce emissions of mercury and other toxic pollutants that can harm brain development of young children and contribute to heart attacks and other health problems in adults.

The planned rollbacks, set to be announced Wednesday, are meant to fulfill President Donald Trump’s repeated pledge to “unleash American energy” and make it more affordable for Americans to power their homes and operate businesses.

If approved and made final, the plans would reverse efforts by President Joe Biden’s administration to address climate change and improve conditions in areas heavily burdened by industrial pollution, mostly in low-income and majority Black or Hispanic communities.

The power plant rules are among about 30 environmental regulations that Zeldin targeted in March when he announced what he called the “most consequential day of deregulation in American history.” He said the actions would put a “dagger through the heart of climate-change religion” and introduce a “Golden Age” for the American economy.

Environmental groups vowed to challenge the rules in court.

“Power plants are among the largest sources of dangerous pollution in the nation. We have modern technologies that allow these plants to reduce pollution with available and cost-effective solutions,” said Vickie Patton, general counsel of the Environmental Defense Fund.

The clean-air standards targeted by the EPA under Trump, a Republican, “are protecting people across America today and will safeguard future generations,” Patton said.

“Ignoring the immense harm to public health from power plant pollution is a clear violation of the law,” added Manish Bapna, president and CEO of the Natural Resources Defense Council. “Our lawyers will be watching closely, and if EPA finalizes a slapdash effort to repeal those rules, we’ll see them in court.”

The EPA-targeted rules could prevent an estimated 30,000 deaths and save $275 billion each year they are in effect, according to an Associated Press examination that included the agency’s own prior assessments and a wide range of other research.

It’s by no means guaranteed that the rules will be entirely eliminated — they can’t be changed without going through a federal rulemaking process that can take years and requires public comment and scientific justification.

Even a partial dismantling of the rules would mean more pollutants such as smog, mercury and lead — and especially more tiny airborne particles that can lodge in lungs and cause health problems, the AP analysis found. It would also mean higher emissions of the greenhouse gases driving Earth’s warming to deadlier levels.

Biden, a Democrat, had made fighting climate change a hallmark of his presidency. Coal-fired power plants would be forced to capture smokestack emissions or shut down under a strict EPA rule issued last year. Then-EPA head Michael Regan said the power plant rules — the Biden administration’s most ambitious effort to roll back planet-warming pollution from the power sector — would reduce pollution and improve public health while supporting a reliable, long-term supply of electricity.

The power sector is the nation’s second-largest contributor to climate change, after transportation.

In its proposed regulation, the Trump EPA argues that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases from fossil fuel-fired power plants “do not contribute significantly to dangerous pollution” or to climate change and therefore do not meet a threshold under the Clean Air Act for regulatory action.

A paper published earlier this year in the journal Science found the Biden-era rules could reduce U.S. power sector carbon emissions by 73% to 86% below 2005 levels by 2040, compared with a reduction of 60% to 83% without the rules.

“Our research shows that EPA’s power plant rules make substantial strides to protect human health and the environment,” said Aaron Bergman, a fellow at Resources for the Future, a nonprofit research institution and a co-author of the Science paper.

“Carbon emissions in the power sector drop at a faster rate with the (Biden-era) rules in place than without them,” Bergman said in an email. “And we also would have seen significant reductions in sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides, pollutants that harm human health.”",https://dailyjournal.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/preview-897.jpg,N,,2025-06-12 23:49:24.701574

On the outskirts of Guilford County in the town of Oak Ridge, there’s a long alleyway of grass stretching between the trees as far as the eye can see.

Brenda Chaney’s farmhouse is in the middle of the path. Far beneath the surface: three pipes full of natural gas, mostly methane, obtained through hydraulic fracturing or fracking. The Williams Companies’ Transco natural gas pipeline, stretching from New York City to the southern tip of Texas, channels it underneath properties like Chaney’s. The company has operated in Guilford County for more than 75 years, its Transco pipeline supplying natural gas to Duke Energy, the region’s biggest power supplier.

When Chaney purchased the property nearly a decade ago, she had no idea what was beneath. Due to the pipeline easement on Chaney’s property, Williams has the right to what’s below the surface. Those rights were signed away, and pipes were built decades ago. Chaney and others are concerned about their safety and plans to expand the pipeline.

The company is planning to install more pipe for the Southeast Supply Enhancement Project, or SSEP. The addition would expand Transco’s pipeline infrastructure by 24 miles, funneling pipeline 42 inches thick through portions of Guilford, Rockingham, Forsyth, and Davidson counties. Natural gas supporters say it’s cleaner than other fossil fuels. But the Environmental Defense Fund estimates, based on published field survey data, that natural gas pipelines nationwide are leaking as much as 2.6 million tons of methane each year.

Chaney is a registered Republican. People assume she’d be all for “drill, baby, drill,” she said. She’s really tired of judgment from those who don’t have a personal stake in the matter, she said.

“I see a lot of people trying to make this a political issue,” she said. “It’s not.”

“I’m talking to people from every single party,” she said. “It’s not about that. What we have asked for repeatedly is just transparency on the safety of these.”

‘No Warning System’

The federal government provides tax subsidies to the fossil fuel industry to encourage energy production on U.S. soil. Direct subsidies have been estimated at roughly $20 billion per year, with 20 percent currently allocated to coal and 80 percent to natural gas and crude oil, according to the Environmental and Energy Study Institute.

Williams plans to start pipeline construction in the third quarter of 2026, and start service in late 2027. But to move forward with the project, Williams needs approval from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). It’s a five-member board currently chaired by Mark Christie, tapped for the seat in January, the day President Donald Trump took office. The other three members are former President Joe Biden’s appointees. One seat is currently vacant.

In January, FERC announced that it would prepare an environmental assessment for SSEP. Its projected publishing date will be November 7, followed by a 30-day public comment period. The typical comment period for an environmental impact statement is 90 days. FERC will have a deadline of February 5, 2026, to decide whether it considers the expansion necessary and appropriate.

During an April 17 county commission work session, Caroline Hansley, a campaign organizing strategist with the environmental advocacy group, Sierra Club, urged county leaders to produce a resolution against the company’s plans and send it to FERC, saying that the deciding body might take the county’s opinion into account when making permit decisions.

County commissioners asked Williams’ representatives numerous safety questions during a May 15 work session.

“We have a history of safe operations near community assets,” said Kyle Tarpley, who handles community and project outreach for Williams. Those assets include schools and churches like the ones the pipeline will be near.

The pipes are internally inspected once every six years, said Joey Page, a senior operations manager for Williams. They can remotely close valves to contain damage if a problem arises, said Rob Krenz, a project director with the company.

But if there was a problem, District 4 Commissioner Mary Beth Murphy asked, how would nearby residents be notified?

“There’s no warning system,” Page said. “If we determine that there’s a risk, then Williams will determine who needs to be evacuated and they’ll take care of it.”

They would go door to door and work with the authorities, he said.

That doesn’t sit right with Chaney.

“I’m like, ‘Come on guys, if you’ve got the proof, you would have it already out in front of everybody, like see how safe these are,’” she said.

Further investigation shows Williams doesn’t have a great safety record. In the last decade, per the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, the company’s pipelines and compressor stations have had several fatal explosions or caught fire. A litany of safety violations has led to millions in fines.

The company also isn’t offering Chaney much in return for the extra pipe, she said.

For Chaney, it’s not just that it’s a lowball figure. It’s not just that her property value will plummet. It’s about her safety and the safety of her family. Her daughter lives in the house across the street, next to the pipeline. Her son planned to build a house where the company aims to build the pipe. He’s called that off.

“There is no amount of money that they can pay me that will make me feel good about this happening,” she said.

“I need to know that there’s safety guidelines put in place so that we can live in Oak Ridge and enjoy where we are,” she said. “I understand that the rights of the individual don’t top the rights of society as a whole. But the rights of an individual should be concerned over the rights of a corporation to make bigger profits.”

‘Trying to Level the Playing Field’

Historically, natural gas pipelines run a disproportionately concentrated path through marginalized and vulnerable communities. From an Indigenous perspective, the pipeline is encroaching on a homeland that has been beloved by native people for centuries.

“People are pushing us at light speed to be capitalistic,” said Dr. Crystal Cavalier-Keck, a citizen of the Occaneechi Band of the Saponi Nation. “Like, don’t value the Earth, don’t value the water. Don’t value your family, but value the dollar.”

Cavalier-Keck is advocating against the pipeline’s expansion. She co-founded 7 Directions of Service, an Indigenous-led environmental justice and community organizing collective in North Carolina, with her husband, Jason Crazy Bear Keck. They felt called to action when the Mountain Valley Pipeline Southgate extension project threatened to go through Cavalier-Keck’s hometown and tribal grounds. Cavalier-Keck and her husband have been organizing to stall and prevent the project for the last several years.

“I’m just trying to level the playing field of how to incorporate our values back. We have to stand up and protect what our ancestors protected,” Cavalier-Keck said.

It’s David versus Goliath, she said. But for the husband-and-wife team, the way they fight back against big corporations is to do it all. From local political action to buying billboards, taking buses to Washington, D.C., and taking legal action, nothing is off the table.

In the chambers of the Old Guilford County Courthouse on June 5, activists lined the rows of chairs, wearing shirts adorned with pins, and waving signs.

District 6 Commissioner Brandon Gray-Hill, who represents the area in Guilford County where Williams is planning to add pipe, read a resolution urging the FERC to “meaningfully address safety and environmental concerns” in terms of the additional pipeline. It’s not exactly what activists had been pushing for, but it was something.

The project “raises a range of concerns for citizens,” the statement read, including public safety risks, water resource impacts, and other environmental degradation.

According to the county, a copy of the resolution will be forwarded to FERC, as well as the North Carolina Utilities Commission, and to state and federal Guilford County representatives.

At the end of the meeting, the crowd celebrated even that small victory. County leaders heard them, they said. They hadn’t been ignored.

Chaney was more realistic.“This is not stopping them,” she said.

But she and others won’t stop trying.",https://www.theassemblync.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Pipeline-Opposition-Protest-1-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-06-12 23:45:45.447491

These strategic investments in advanced energy manufacturing, electric transportation, and electric grid resilience are powering job creation, revitalizing rural areas, and positioning South Carolina as a national leader in American-made energy. These clean energy tax credits are critical for businesses, like mine, here in South Carolina in order to maintain investment and continue growing the manufacturing base within the Palmetto State.

South Carolina’s power grid — like much of the nation’s — is aging and under rising pressure.

Demand from data centers, manufacturing expansions, and electric vehicles is expected to surge over the next decade. In South Carolina, the commercial and industrial electricity rates are 10.97 cents/kWh and 7.01 cents/kWh, respectively, and both are below the national average.

However, electricity rates are up almost 6% from the year prior. Reduced incentivized investment in clean energy infrastructure could lead to even higher prices due to a reliance on more expensive, traditional power sources. Strategic energy investments, supported by stable tax policies, will help us avoid future grid shortfalls, prevent the risk of rolling blackouts, and reduce long-term energy costs for South Carolina families and businesses.

Tax credits are not a new concept — they have been a bipartisan policy tool used for decades to support emerging technologies. From artificial intelligence to biotechnology, to government investments driving technologies like GPS and the internet, these investments have repeatedly demonstrated their value. Clean energy technologies are no exception.

In 2024, over 2,600 megawatts of solar energy capacity came online in South Carolina, equating to enough power to supply 325,640 homes.

Over the next five years, South Carolina is projected to add over 2,500 megawatts of solar capacity.

Retaining the existing energy tax credits will allow businesses in South Carolina to continue to develop and deploy renewable energy technologies which are vital to improve grid resiliency, promote greater efficiency that results in lower energy costs for everyone, and foster economic opportunities in our rural communities.

Energy diversification mirrors a sound investment portfolio. Just as diverse assets protect against market volatility, multiple energy sources safeguard against physical and cyber threats. In addition, if we’re manufacturing these technologies here in South Carolina, we are securing our energy independence by growing our ability to produce what we need at home and having greater control over our supply chain.

Businesses have planned with these tax incentives in mind and rely upon them for capital allocation, planning, and project commitments — all of which would be threatened by the whiplash of major changes to these credits or further restrictions.

We’ve already seen a taste of what this disruption can do.

Recent federal changes and uncertainty have led to an indefinite pause in the construction of the AESC manufacturing facility in Florence, a $1.6 billion investment that promised to create 1,600 jobs in the Pee Dee.

A full repeal of these vital credits would undermine significant progress made in clean energy innovation, economic growth, and national security, and likely cede jobs and progress to China.

Now it’s up to our elected officials on Capitol Hill to decide whether these clean energy tax credits continue as Congress intended in 2022.

These private and public investments will spur domestic production of clean energy technologies which will set the United States up to compete in the global clean energy economy and create thousands more in clean energy jobs that will benefit all South Carolinians.

South Carolina businesses are ready to build — ready to invest in local workers, modern energy systems, and secure supply chains. But we need policy certainty to stay competitive.

The version of the budget bill narrowly passed by the House of Representatives in mid-May would rescind clean energy tax credits for individuals and businesses that were enacted as part of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, which aimed to invest hundreds of billions of dollars toward modernizing American energy and fighting climate change.

The proposed repeals threaten nascent progress in new battery technology and electric vehicles and would slow down the adoption of less-polluting forms of energy. According to energy analysts, ending these programs would also increase U.S. emissions of climate-warming pollution and raise energy bills for households and businesses.

Most people in most states say that clean energy should be a high or very high priority

The repeals aren’t what most Americans say they want.

In fact, about 63% of Americans said in a December 2024 poll that developing clean energy sources should be a high or very high priority for the president and Congress, according to the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication, the publisher of this site.

Clean energy is widely popular across the country and supported by most voters, including majorities in most red states.

The map below shows the estimated percentage of people in each state who say developing clean energy sources should be a high or very high priority for the president and Congress. The map is interactive; hover over or tap on a state to see the details.

In all but two states, the majority of adults think that developing clean energy should be a high priority for the president and Congress.

Even in West Virginia, where coal wields a major influence on the state economy and 70% of the vote went to Donald Trump in 2024, a narrow majority of people (51%) say clean energy is a high priority.

Wyoming and North Dakota are the only states where less than half the population prioritizes clean energy development. Both of these states produce fossil fuels, but that alone doesn’t fully account for public sentiment. Other fossil-fuel-producing states, such as West Virginia, Kentucky, Montana, Alaska, Texas, and Oklahoma, all show majority support for clean energy development.

Overall, the area with the strongest support for clean energy development is the District of Columbia at 78% support, followed by Massachusetts, Maryland, Hawaii, and Vermont, where about 70% of adults say clean energy should be a priority.

Among the states that voted for Donald Trump in 2024, those where residents have the most positive views of clean energy are Florida, Nevada, North Carolina, and Arizona.

North Carolina is a particularly important case.

Republican Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina was among four GOP senators who wrote a letter to Senate Majority Leader John Thune in April cautioning against a full repeal of energy tax credits, “which could lead to significant disruptions for the American people and weaken our position as a global energy leader.”

At the moment, incentives in the Inflation Reduction Act are driving major economic development to red states, with investments in modern manufacturing, grid upgrades, weatherization, energy research, and clean energy deployment.

North Carolina was slated to receive nearly $22 billion in investments through the Department of Energy and private companies under the Inflation Reduction Act. If the proposed projects don’t get canceled, North Carolina would receive the fifth-largest energy investment among the 50 states, with multiple projects for battery and EV manufacturing that are each worth over $1 billion. Sen. Tillis is up for reelection in 2026, making his vote one that clean energy hawks are watching closely.

The other Republican senators writing in support of clean energy projects were Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, John Curtis of Utah, and Jerry Moran of Kansas. Sen. Curtis also expressed support for clean energy tax credits and investments during a recent tour of a newly expanded battery production facility in Utah.

Republicans hold a slim majority of 53 seats in the Senate, and some of the country’s most important energy projects hang in that precarious balance.

Significant changes to tax credits could directly impact the financial planning and operational strategies of the solar and renewable energy industries.

The new legislation introduces complexities around FEOCs, requiring careful review to ensure compliance and mitigate potential risks.

Solar developers must closely examine the updated Safe Harbor provisions to take advantage of opportunities while navigating associated challenges.

Advanced manufacturing tax credits face potential reductions, which could disrupt innovation and expansion within the renewable energy sector.

Despite uncertainties, the evolving renewable energy legislation also presents opportunities for growth and strategic adaptation.

The U.S. Senate is currently reviewing the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act”, which passed through the U.S. House of Representatives on May 22, 2025. If the Bill remains unchanged, the sweeping legislation will drastically reshape how the renewable energy industry approaches tax credits and supply chain planning. Womble Bond Dickinson has previously explored recent federal changes to Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). Now, we look into the latest effort to repeal and restrict aspects of the IRA.

There are three key provisions that we are watching: § 45X – the Advanced Manufacturing Production Tax Credit, § 48E – the Clean Electricity Investment Credit, and § 45Y – the Clean Electricity Production Tax Credit. Each of these tax credits have been a large factor in the onshoring and growth of U.S. solar manufacturing, and each will be severely restricted under new legislation if the Senate does not make changes.

Although the Bill passed by the House kept § 45X largely intact, the House included an onerous and confusing Foreign Entities of Concern (FEOC) provision that could dramatically constrain use of the § 45X Advanced Manufacturing Production Tax Credit. The House version of the Bill also includes a similarly deeply granular FEOC provision for § 48E and § 45Y, coupled with a 60-day cut off to “commence construction” in order to maintain eligibility for the tax credits. Together, these changes could cause deep disruptions to the sector.

Within its relevant FEOC provisions, the Bill includes two categories of Prohibited Foreign Entities rules. These rules are generating concern within the industry over potential supply chain disruptions and, should these rules create a barrier to claiming the tax credit, stranded investments. Under the Bill, entities may be categorized as Specified Foreign Entities (SFEs) or Foreign-Influences Entities (FIEs). Too much involvement with either category could render a taxpayer ineligible for the tax credit in certain tax years.

SFEs are owned, controlled by or subject to the jurisdiction of a “foreign entity of concern,” described in 15 U.S.C. § 465. They could also be entities specifically enumerated as threats to national security by federal agencies, as well as entities “controlled by” the above FEOCs. The prohibition goes into effect in the tax year after enactment of the legislation.

FIEs are based on the taxable year and are defined as entities where an SFE can appoint a covered officer, an SFE owns more than 10%, or one or more SFEs own 25% or hold 25% of debt in the aggregate. FIEs also include entities that, during the previous taxable year, made a payment to an SFE of 10% (5% for § 45X) of total payments, or knowingly makes such payments to more than one SFE of 25% of the total payments (15% for § 45X). FIE restrictions are effective for tax years beginning two years after enactment.

At the component level, there are also prohibitions if a taxpayer received “material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity,” holds a licensing agreement with an SFE or FIE, or if the taxpayer makes certain payments other than for goods, which can all eliminate eligibility for the tax incentives.

Should these provisions be retained in the final Bill, they will naturally create ambiguity in what entities will be listed as FIEs and muddy stakeholders’ planning.

The uncertainty created by the Bill is compounded by the Internal Revenue Service rulemaking process that will follow the Bill’s enactment. Even if the Bill passes both chambers of Congress and is signed into law by President Trump in July, we may not see clear guidance until the second quarter of 2026. The U.S. Department of the Treasury will need to clarify several provisions of the Bill through revising current guidance and issuing new rules. The IRS rulemaking process typically takes twelve months after new tax legislation has been enacted, forcing stakeholders to wait until next year to see exactly how the IRS will enforce the Bill’s provisions.

Perhaps as an acknowledgement of the potential industry disruption it creates, the current draft of the Bill includes safe harbor provisions under § 48E and § 45Y. However, the safe harbor is quite narrow.

Safe harbor provisions in new federal legislation often provide relief for developers who have commenced construction or spent 5% of total project costs. The Bill, however, implements extremely short timelines to keep projects qualified for tax credits. These short qualification windows undermine industry stakeholders’ financial plans that rely on specific projects to qualify for the credits. Under the Bill, Solar developers will need to commence construction of projects within 60 days of the Bill’s enactment and the projects need to be “placed in service,” meaning delivering power, by the end of 2028 to remain qualified for the tax credits. The Bill’s emphasis on construction commencement means early-stage projects will likely struggle the most to meet the safe harbor deadlines.

While the Bill does not alter the transferability of § 48E or § 45Y tax credits, it does restrict the transferability of the § 45X tax credit by cutting off eligibility for components sold after December 31, 2027. The limitation on transferability adds another layer to disrupted financial planning, project development and business growth opportunities.

The expanded and confusing definition of FEOCs, narrowed safe harbor provisions and limitations on transferability in the Bill put the solar industry at risk of losing tax credits that have been critical to manufacturing, project financing and planning. The Senate is expected to move fast with a deadline of July 4th. It remains to be seen how the Senate will modify the House version. With an expedited Senate process, clean energy manufacturers, developers, and financiers must be ready to act fast and understand the impacts this new legislation will have on their business.

Domestic manufacturers and developers should closely examine their current supply chains and project timelines and prepare contingency plans to react to the upcoming legislation. If the proposed FEOC provisions are passed in current form, taxpayers sourcing materials and components from covered nations will need to ensure they have an intimate understanding of their supply chain to ensure compliance with the FEOC rules.

To be clear, data centers aren’t the target of the Texas Backup Power Package Program.
The $1.8 billion microgrid program ​“unlocks opportunities for customers who aren’t as sophisticated, and don’t have the wherewithal to pay that extra cost,” he said.","The Texas Legislature ended its biennial session without passing a slew of bills that could have killed the state’s booming solar and battery sector, and by extension, the ability to keep the Texas grid running amid extreme weather and surging demand for electricity.

It did pass a law that could strengthen the state’s electricity reliability by encouraging the construction of more microgrids — combinations of small-scale gas-fired power, solar, and batteries that can be built quickly. Last week, Texas lawmakers authorized a long-awaited $1.8 billion fund to support microgrid deployment at hospitals, nursing homes, water treatment plants, police and fire stations, and other critical facilities across the state.

The Texas Backup Power Package Program has awaited funding since 2023, when it was created as part of a broader legislative package. The goal is to help Texans protect themselves against extreme weather-driven grid emergencies like the disastrous blackouts during 2021’s Winter Storm Uri, or the widespread power outages after 2024’s Hurricane Beryl.

Lawmakers failed to authorize the $1.8 billion in microgrid funding in 2023, however. Instead, the state pushed ahead with $5 billion for the Texas Energy Fund, which offers low-interest loans to developers of large-scale gas-fired power plants. That program has struggled. One project that applied for funding was found to be fraudulent. Others were denied loans. And many more projects have dropped out of contention, as developers deal with the same gas turbine shortages and rising costs that are dogging gas build-outs across the country.

This year, lawmakers finally approved the microgrid funding, which is part of the remaining $5 billion in Texas Energy Fund spending officially authorized during the just-concluded session. That’s a big deal, said Doug Lewin, president of Texas-based energy consultancy Stoic Energy and author of The Texas Energy and Power Newsletter.

“Now those funds will presumably begin to flow — and I think that puts us in the upper echelon of states for microgrid policy,” he said.

Among the bills that failed this session in the face of opposition from environmental, business, and consumer groups were two — SB 388 and SB 715 — that would have forced new solar, wind, and battery projects to pay for a massive and equivalent amount of new capacity from fossil-gas power plants.

The problem with such policies is not just the fallacy that building more planet-warming gas power plants guarantees a more reliable grid, industry experts say. It’s also that companies simply can’t build gas power plants fast enough to meet booming energy needs, not just in Texas, but across the country. Because those bills would have required gas to be built alongside renewables — and because gas power plant construction is seriously constrained — the legislation would have amounted to a block on many gigawatts’ worth of new solar, wind, and battery developments in the state.

”I think one of the most important things that happened this session is this really broad-based business coalition communicating to anyone who would listen that these policies trying to restrict development of renewables aren’t helpful,” Lewin said.

Low-cost power from renewables and batteries ​“is a big deal to manufacturers, to industrial customers, and to the oil and gas industry that’s been working off diesel generators for decades and are now connecting to the grid,” he said.

Making microgrids happen

For years now, Lewin has been calling on state leaders to focus on helping customers save energy and keep power flowing during hurricanes, heat waves, and winter storms. He thinks microgrids are a good way to do that.

When the broader grid is functioning well, facilities equipped with microgrids can use their solar, batteries, and generators to reduce their use of grid power. But when the grid goes down or experiences serious stress, those facilities can rely on those resources to continue running.

Microgrids could also help meet ballooning power demand from homes, businesses, factories, and especially data centers chasing the AI boom that make up a massive share of future load growth forecasts, he said. The Electric Reliability Council of Texas, the grid operator for most of the state, forecast in April that peak electricity demand could more than double in the next five years. The number of data centers that end up getting built in Texas will ultimately determine how much new power the state actually needs.

The microgrid program limits individual projects to no larger than 2.5 megawatts, Lewin said. That’s far smaller than the hundreds of megawatts of capacity that can come from a single gas-fired power plant. But what microgrid projects lack in size they make up for in speed of construction, and many smaller-scale backup power projects will do more to meet demand than big power plants that take five or more years to build, he said. That’s especially true if the microgrids are located at data centers themselves.

To be clear, data centers aren’t the target of the Texas Backup Power Package Program. Instead, the fund is set up to help sites that can’t otherwise afford on-site backup power, explained Joel Yu, senior vice president of policy and external affairs at Enchanted Rock. The Houston-based microgrid operator runs 500 megawatts’ worth of projects at grocery stores, truck stops, and other large power customers in Texas. Enchanted Rock has also deployed gas-fired generators at water utilities and irrigation districts, including Houston’s Northeast Water Purification Plant.

“The $1.8 billion is a huge amount of money, and more ambitious than programs we’ve seen in other jurisdictions,” Yu said. ​“But it’s very much in line with state policy to improve resilience at critical facilities since Winter Storm Uri,” which knocked out power to more than 4.5 million people for up to a week in February 2021, leading to the deaths of an estimated 200 people and more than $100 billion in property damages.

Enchanted Rock’s existing customers tend to be larger entities that can secure financing and clearly quantify the financial value of backup power generation, Yu said. The $1.8 billion microgrid program ​“unlocks opportunities for customers who aren’t as sophisticated, and don’t have the wherewithal to pay that extra cost,” he said.

Assisted living facilities are particularly good candidates for state-funded microgrids, given how deadly power outages can be to older adults or medically compromised people. Alexa Schoeman, deputy of the state’s long-term care ombudsman’s office, told the Public Utility Commission of Texas in a March statement that the more than 80,000 residents of assisted living facilities in the state are at risk from extended power outages, and that ​“operators have cited cost as the reason they are not able to install life-saving backup power at their locations.”

Yu declined to name any customers that Enchanted Rock is working with to take advantage of the fund. ​“But there’s been a lot of interest from critical facilities that might want to make use of this. We’ve talked to folks in nursing homes, assisted living industries, and low-income housing, and other critical infrastructure, trying to get into the program.”

Enchanted Rock has joined other backup generation providers including Bloom Energy, Base Power, Cummins, Generac, Mainspring Energy, and Power Secure in what Yu called an ​“informal group of like-minded companies.” Dubbed Grid Resilience in Texas, or GRIT for short, the coalition is working with the Electric Reliability Council of Texas and the Public Utility Commission on the $1.8 billion microgrid program, he said.

Most of these companies focus on gas-fueled power generation systems, whether those are reciprocating engines like those Enchanted Rock uses, linear generators from Mainspring, or fuel cells from Bloom Energy. Others specialize in battery backup systems, as with startup Base Power, or combine solar, batteries, and energy control systems with generators, as with Generac.

The legislation creating the Texas Backup Power Package Program allows projects to tap up to $500 of state funding per kilowatt of generation capacity installed, and requires solar, batteries, and either fossil gas or propane-fueled generation, Yu said. But it ​“isn’t prescriptive about what proportions are in the mix,” he added.

Different combinations could offer more favorable economics for different types of customers. Some may find that lots of solar panels are useful for lowering day-to-day utility bills, while others may want to maximize gas-fueled generation to cover multiday winter outages, when solar-charged batteries are less useful.

The legislation creating the program does limit projects from actively playing in the grid operator’s market programs, Yu added, meaning microgrid owners will face restrictions on selling the power they generate or the grid-balancing services they can provide to the market.

Still, that ​“does leave some room for customers to leverage the assets for behind-the-meter value,” such as using solar to offset utility power purchases, Yu said. ​“That’s going to be very important to making the economics work.”",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/Enchanted-Rock-backup-generators-being-built-at-Houston-water-treatment-plant.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=d74ba99181c76f1fdd25603d72a8516c,N,,2025-06-12 23:43:07.810711
