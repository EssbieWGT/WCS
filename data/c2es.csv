Often called “forever chemicals,” PFAS are associated by the Environmental Protection Agency with an increased risk of kidney and testicular cancer, and liver damage.
Both proposed rules require facilities that detect the substances to submit a mitigation plan to NCDEQ.

The proposed “monitoring and minimization” rule would require industrial facilities to sample their wastewater and, if the compounds are detected, submit a plan to the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality to reduce levels over time. However, it leaves out discharge limits and has some critics calling the rules “toothless.”

The vote, scheduled for Jan. 7 and 8 in Raleigh, represents a shift in strategy from 2024, when state scientists proposed setting hard caps on the concentration of chemicals allowed in the water. Under the current draft, there are no fixed numeric limits and no automatic civil penalties for facilities who continue to discharge the chemicals, provided they are following a state-approved minimization plan.

The new rules were developed in March 2025 following a directive from the EMC’s Water Quality Committee to focus on identifying the source of the pollution rather than installing concentration levels. The previous 2024 draft proposed a limit of 0.35 parts per billion for 1,4-dioxane and near-zero levels for eight PFAS compounds, including PFOA, PFOS, GenX, PFBS, PFBA, PFHxA, PFHxS, and PFNA. Often called “forever chemicals,” PFAS are associated by the Environmental Protection Agency with an increased risk of kidney and testicular cancer, and liver damage.

1,4-dioxane is a synthetic industrial solvent the EPA classifies as a “likely human carcinogen,” linked to liver and kidney toxicity.

EMC Water Quality Committee Chairman and EMC Commissioner Steve Keen noted in a previous public meeting from March 2025 much of the current draft’s language originated from the NC Water Quality Association. The NCWQA represents the state’s largest public utilities — including the Cape Fear Public Utilities Authority — but is often criticized by environmentalist groups as a pro-industry lobby because it also advocates for industrial dischargers.

NCWQA members Asheboro, Greensboro, and Reidsville successfully sued the state in 2024 to overturn 1,4-dioxane limits, a move currently being challenged by the Southern Environmental Law Center. Despite being a member, CFPUA executive director Kenneth Waldroup has distanced the utility from the proposed rules, noting in a May 2025 letter to the EMC that regulation without enforceable targets is “no more than an action in name only providing empty promises to the people of North Carolina.”

By allowing the association to help write the rules, critics like the SELC argue the EMC essentially allowed chemical dischargers to set their own terms.

The 15-member EMC body — appointed by the governor, General Assembly leaders, and the agricultural commissioner — is charged with reviewing and enacting rules for NCDEQ. The commission is considering the regulatory package as a single item, though it technically consists of two rules addressing different classes of contaminants. The first targets three specific PFAS compounds — PFOA, PFOS, and GenX — and the other rule for 1,4-dioxane.

PFOA and PFOS are “legacy” chemicals phased out of production years ago, but continue to persist in the environment and contaminate local waterways. In contrast, GenX is a modern replacement chemical still actively manufactured at the Chemours Fayetteville Works facility.

Although the EPA established federal limits of 4 parts per trillion for PFOA and PFOS in 2024, the agency moved in May 2025 to rescind protections for several other chemicals — GenX, PFHxS, PFNA, and PFBS. It leaves North Carolina without any enforceable federal or state limits on GenX discharge, meaning the monitoring and minimization rules currently before the EMC are now the only active regulatory proposal on the table for the compound.

There is currently no enforceable federal limit for 1,4-dioxane, though the EPA maintains a non-enforceable health advisory level of 0.35 parts per billion.

Both proposed rules require facilities that detect the substances to submit a mitigation plan to NCDEQ. The plans would outline how a facility intends to lower its discharge and be subject to a state review every two years.

For downstream communities like Wilmington, the primary question is how the lack of hard discharge limits affects water treatment costs. In 2024, an NCDEQ fiscal analysis suggested setting numeric limits at the source of pollution could save the state $9.96 billion over 36 years, primarily by reducing the need for expensive filtration at municipal water plants.

The Cape Fear Public Utilities Authority installed granular activated carbon filters in 2022 for $46 million, to remove PFAS to non-detectable levels in the water, but the filters are less effective at removing 1,4-dioxane. Unlike PFAS, which sticks to the carbon filters, 1,4-dioxane stays bonded to water molecules and passes right through them.

To manage 1,4-dioxane, CFPUA utilizes ozone and biological filters at the Sweeney Water Treatment Plant, which breaks down the chemical rather than just trapping it. While the current system removes about 52% of 1,4-dioxane from raw water, the utility is exploring alternative and potentially expensive methods to remove the chemical completely.

Because the proposed rule does not mandate a specific reduction in upstream pollution, local filtration systems would remain the primary line of defense. Hannah Nelson, attorney at the Southern Environmental Law Center, wrote in a December 2025 letter to the commission the rules represent a “polluter wish-list” allowing industries to continue discharging toxic waste without facing consequences.

“By moving to a monitoring-only model, the state is allowing these companies to prioritize their profits over the health of communities downstream,” Nelson said to Port City Daily. “Water utilities and their ratepayers are ultimately left paying the bill for infrastructure that should have been funded by the polluters themselves.”

However, the NC Water Quality Association defends its approach as a “practical necessity.” In a letter to the EMC from September 2024, supported by the cities of Greensboro, Asheboro, and Raleigh, association attorney Paul Calamita argued setting immediate numeric limits would place an expensive burden on municipal taxpayers and utility ratepayers. He contended many local wastewater plants were never designed to remove industrial chemicals like 1,4-dioxane and would require “large capital investments” for infrastructure upgrades, the cost ultimately trickling down to ratepayers.

CPUA’s GAC filters have led to two specific rate increases on Wilmington taxpayers since 2022. The initial jump went into effect on July 1, 2022, when the average monthly bill increased by $5.39 — a hike CFPUA leadership said was 70% driven by the need to treat Chemours’ PFAS. A second 4.6% increase followed in 2024, attributed to a $1.3 million rise in annual operating expenses for the GAC filters.

CFPUA is pursuing a federal lawsuit against Chemours to recover treatment costs, which, if successful, CFPUA director Waldroup noted in 2022 would lead to a reduction in customer rates.

Because the substances are costly to treat, the NC Water Quality Association maintains the state should first find exact industries that are sending chemicals to city wastewater treatment plants. The association contends mandating strict reduction targets is unrealistic until the state better understands the source.

SELC’s Nelson countered, without numeric limits the new rules do not provide enough incentive for industries to change their practices.

“NCDEQ’s rules would have made sure that polluters kept their pollution below a level that it determined would not threaten health,” Nelson said. “In contrast, the EMC’s polluter-written rules do nothing to reduce pollution from industry or wastewater treatment plants. There is no level that dischargers must meet, and there are no consequences if a polluter fails to reduce its toxic pollution at all.

The SELC also warns the new rules remove public transparency. While the state currently tracks 40 different “forever chemicals” at various facilities, the proposed framework would only require industries to report data for three — PFOA, PFOS, and GenX.

In practice, SELC attorney Jean Zhuang argues this creates a “redaction loophole.” Because labs typically test for dozens of chemicals at once, a facility will receive a report showing the full extent of its pollution.

“In practice, this means that dischargers will receive a lab report showing the levels of dozens of PFAS compounds and will then redact all but the PFOA, PFOS, and GenX data,” Zhuang wrote.

The timing of the EMC’s vote is significant due to the REINS Act, H.B. 402, which became law in August 2025. The act requires any regulation with a projected financial impact of $20 million or more over five years must be approved by the General Assembly, regardless of its public benefit.

Implementing numeric limits for PFAS and 1,4-dioxane would likely exceed the $20-million threshold because of expensive infrastructure costs required to remove the compounds. Since many facilities across the state would need technology like CFPUA’s GAC filters, the total cost statewide would be in the hundreds of millions. The city of Pittsboro already operates its own GAC system, while Greensboro and Fayetteville are currently in the process of constructing GAC facilities.

“The REINS Act made it very difficult for strong — science-based rules to get passed,” Nelson stated. “We know that rules designed to protect water quality can be expensive, but they come with a lot of benefits and often more benefits than costs.”

The EMC Water Quality Committee will meet Wednesday, Jan. 7, to consider and vote on the proposed rules, with the full EMC is expected to take a final vote on Thursday, Jan. 8, at 9 a.m. Both meetings will be held at the Archdale Building in Raleigh and are open to the public, though a livestream is also available.

If the EMC moves forward with the proposal, it does not immediately become law. Instead, the vote starts a mandatory 60-day public comment period, a window advocates say is the last chance for residents to influence the outcome.

“I hope that the EMC listens to the public opposition to these rules and changes their mind,” Nelson said. “I hope they realize that their job is to protect the water we drink and the communities that rely on it, not polluters’ profits.”

If denied, the state would remain without formal rules for the chemicals and the process to establish those rules would effectively restart.

NCDEQ leadership did not respond to requests for comment by press. A spokesperson for the agency cited limited staff availability during the holidays and indicated a formal response would not be available until the first week of the new year; this will be updated upon their response.

The laws cover a range of categories, from business and real estate, to healthcare, adoption and gender identity. The laws, reflecting a legislative process that often saw the state legislature pitted against the governor, as the two power centers looked to weigh proposed legislation in their favor.

NEW NORTH CAROLINA LAW STRICTLY DEFINING SEXES AS MALE OR FEMALE GOES INTO EFFECT

House Bill 805 was passed after a legislative override of the governor’s veto. The bill began life as a bipartisan effort to protect women and children from online sexual predators. After passing the state House, the bill was re-shaped in the Senate into what became an effort to codify gender identity into North Carolina law. The new law, which recognizes only two genders on all official state documentation, requires individuals to be identified by their gender at birth and not by their chosen gender identity or presentation. The change would most notably affect identification, such as driver’s licenses. While state senator Kevin Corbin (R) calls it “fair for everyone,” state senator Julie Mayfield (D) calls it “another example of importing to North Carolina this national anti-LGBTQ agenda.”

Senate Bill 248 takes a significant step in reducing the differences in birth certificates for those who are adopted. The new law allows for adoptive parents to be named on a child’s birth certificate, while making it easier for counties to issue certified birth certificates to adopted individuals.

Senate Bill 690 covers a range of business/broker-related issues. Most notably, its provision changes what is allowed on a real estate purchase offer. The change allows compensation paid (or commission to be paid) to a buyer’s agent to be included in the offer. The full disclosure could have an effect on the negotiation process and the purchase price of a property.

House Bill 67 is designed to increase the number of healthcare professionals serving patients in North Carolina. The legislation clears a pathway for licensed physicians and physician assistants to be employed at North Carolina hospitals. It also allows for more internationally trained medical professionals to gain entry to hospitals in the state.

Tesla said that it delivered 1.64 million vehicles in 2025, down 9% from a year earlier.

Chinese rival BYD, which sold 2.26 million vehicles last year, is now the biggest EV maker.

It’s a stunning reversal for Musk who once dismissed BYD as a threat as Tesla’s rise seemed unstoppable, crushing traditional automakers with far more resources and helping make him the world’s richest man.

For the fourth quarter, sales totaled 418,227, falling short of the 440,000 that analysts polled by FactSet expected. The sales total was impacted by the expiration of a $7,500 tax credit that was phased out by the Trump administration at the end of September.

Tesla stock was up 0.5% at $451.60 in early trading Friday.

Even with multiple issues buffeting the company, investors are betting that Tesla CEO Musk can deliver on his ambitions to make Tesla a leader in robotaxi service and get consumers to embrace humanoid robots that can perform basic tasks in homes and offices. Reflecting that optimism, the stock finished 2025 with a gain of approximately 11%.

The latest quarter was the first with sales of stripped-down versions of the Model Y and Model 3 that Musk unveiled in early October as part of an effort to revive sales. The new Model Y costs just under $40,000 while customers can buy the cheaper Model 3 for under $37,000. Those versions are expected to help Tesla compete with Chinese models in Europe and Asia.

For fourth-quarter earnings coming out in late January, analysts are expecting the company to post a 3% drop in sales and a nearly 40% drop in earnings per share, according to FactSet. Analysts expect the downward trend in sales and profits to eventually reverse itself as 2026 rolls along.

Investors have largely shrugged off the falling numbers, choosing to focus on Musk’s pivot to different parts of business.

He has been saying that plunging car sales don’t matter as much now because the future of the company lies more with his new driverless robotaxis service, the company’s energy storage business and building robots for the home and factory. To make his task worthwhile, Tesla’s directors awarded Musk a potentially enormous new pay package that shareholders backed at the annual meeting in November.

Musk scored another huge windfall two weeks ago when the Delaware Supreme Court reversed a decision that deprived him of a $55 billion pay package that Tesla doled out in 2018.

Musk could become the world’s first trillionaire later this year when he sells shares of his rocket company SpaceX to public for the first time in what analysts expect would be a blockbuster initial public offering.",https://www.chicagotribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Tesla_Sales_10143.jpg?w=1024&h=665,N,,2026-01-02 11:59:02.839713

Nearly every car sold in Norway in 2025 was an EV, and that rising tide lifted even Tesla's boat.","Happy New Year! It's January 2, 2026, and this is The Morning Shift — your daily roundup of the top automotive headlines from around the world, in one place. This is where you'll find the most important stories that are shaping the way Americans drive and get around.

In this morning's edition, we're looking at Tesla's ever-dropping sales, as well as BYD taking its place as the top-selling EV maker globally. We'll also look at how things are going in Norway, EV-wise, and Zeeker's plans to sell to ze Germans.

For years, Tesla has been the top-selling EV maker globally. It really defined the market, getting into pure-EV sales before any other company did so at the same scale, and it's been the company to beat ever since. Until 2025, at least, when it was finally beaten. Now, BYD is the top-selling EV maker in the world. The BBC has BYD's sales numbers:

China's BYD is set to overtake Elon Musk's Tesla as the world's biggest seller of electric vehicles (EVs), marking the first time it has outpaced its American rival for annual sales.

On Thursday, BYD said that sales of its battery-powered cars rose last year by almost 28% to more than 2.25 million.

Tesla, which is due to reveal its total sales for 2025 later on Friday, last week published analysts' estimates suggesting that it had sold around 1.65 million vehicles for the year as a whole.

Since that writing, though, we've gotten Tesla's numbers in.They're a bit better than predicted by the BBC, but not by much: Tesla delivered 1,636,129 cars in 2025, far from the 2.25 million EVs that BYD sold. BYD has beaten Tesla in sales before, technically, but those numbers included PHEVs alongside fully-electric cars. Now, BYD wins with no caveats: It sold more EVs than Tesla, end of sentence.

Tesla is circling the sales drain. The company's CEO seems more focused on robotics (and, for some reason, fast food) than actually selling cars, which has had a predictably detrimental effect on car sales. Well, that, and the whole ""shoving his nose into politics"" thing. In most of Europe, things are looking bad for Tesla. From Reuters:

Tesla registrations fell in some key European markets in December, but surged in Norway confirming a trend of record sales in Europe's EV trailblazer while the U.S. automaker's market share crumbled across the rest of the region in 2025.

Elon Musk's EV brand has seen slowing sales in Europe since late 2024 due to growing competition, its aging lineup and protests against Musk's public praise of European right-wing political figures. It is also expected to report a sharp drop in global fourth-quarter delivery numbers later on Friday.

...

In France, Europe's third-biggest car market after Germany and Britain, Tesla registrations – a proxy for sales – slumped 66% last month to 1,942 vehicles, data from French car body PFA showed on Thursday.

Registrations fell 37% in France in 2025 as a whole.

In Sweden, Tesla registrations fell 71% to 821 vehicles in December leading to a 70% drop in 2025, according to Mobility Sweden.

They also dropped in Portugal and Spain, by 13% to 1,207 cars and 44% to 1,794 respectively, official data showed. For 2025 as a whole, sales fell 22% in Portugal and 4% in Spain.

As we talked about above, Tesla's own numbers paint a bad picture. Fourth-quarter deliveries are down 15%, while full-year numbers are down 9%. Yet, while Tesla, the company that builds and sells cars, seems to be doing worse and worse every day, Tesla the stock is doing just fine. As of this writing, shares in $TSLA are actually up today despite the bad sales news.

Tesla's global sales decline has one exception, though: Norway. Of all countries, Europe's big oil exporter is the one that boosting Tesla sales, buoyed by a market that's gone almost entirely electric. Nearly every car sold in Norway in 2025 was an EV, and that rising tide lifted even Tesla's boat. From Reuters:

Almost all new cars registered in Norway last year were fully electric, official data showed on Friday, headed by booming Tesla sales as the Nordic country cements its global lead in phasing out petrol and diesel-powered vehicles.

Oil-producing Norway's rapid switch to battery-powered vehicles contrasts with the rest of Europe, where weak demand for EVs prompted the European Union last month to reverse its planned 2035 ban on internal combustion engine cars.

Driven by tax incentives, 95.9% of all new cars registered in Norway in 2025 were EVs, with that number at almost 98% in December. The annual figure was up from 88.9% in 2024, Norwegian Road Federation (OFV) data showed.

Norway is such an interesting case, because you'd expect such a major oil producer to be big on getting folks into cars that use oil. Turns out the country's pride in its natural beauty wins out, though, and EVs are heavily incentivized.

Germany has a whole market for company-provided cars, and new rules around how much those cars can cost are limiting the market. Enter Zeekr, which hopes to provide a better offering than Germany's own car companies for that specific market. From Automotive News:

Corporate cost ceilings are reshaping Germany's company-car market in ways that favor Chinese EV newcomers over established European brands.

As fleet program bosses impose a top limit of about €60,000 for company car leases while mandating rapid electrification, employees who traditionally pick an Audi or BMW now face a choice: accept lower-spec European EVs or consider Chinese alternatives with better range and features at the same price point.

Geely-owned Zeekr is betting this cost squeeze will overcome German buyers' historical preference for domestic brands. Unlike many Chinese rivals that have focused on retail buyers or rental fleets, Zeekr is prioritizing the corporate car market, particularly higher-margin company vehicles.

I can honestly say that I don't think anyone I know has ever had a company car. I've heard of them, obviously, I know they exist, but I don't think I've ever personally known anyone who's had one. Sounds like they're a much bigger deal over in Germany, if car companies are explicitly targeting them as a pricing strategy.",https://www.jalopnik.com/img/gallery/teslas-bad-sales-year-means-byd-is-now-the-best-selling-ev-maker-in-the-world/l-intro-1767367731.jpg,N,,2026-01-02 11:59:07.033203

To get there, the Environmental Protection Agency has taken on an unexpected role. Instead of focusing first and foremost on protecting people and the environment, the EPA is increasingly focused on clearing the regulatory path for rapid growth in data centers, chip factories and other AI-related infrastructure.

That shift has created a striking imbalance.

The agency is sprinting in helping companies build the physical backbone of the AI economy but dragging its feet when it comes to using those same powerful tools to improve environmental protection and public health.

Under Administrator Lee Zeldin, the EPA has positioned itself as a facilitator for the tech sector and the fossil fuel industry. Reviews of new chemicals are rushed, hurdles lowered for air pollution permits and approvals streamlined, all under the pretext of keeping the U.S. competitive.

The emphasis is clear: move fast.

This deregulatory zeal stands in stark contrast to the agency’s own lethargic embrace of AI to actually improve environmental and public health outcomes for communities across America.

So far, the EPA’s most visible efforts focus on basic office functions, such as sorting and summarizing public comments. These tools may save staff time, but they barely scratch the surface of what AI could do for the agency’s core work.

The same technologies that power large language models could help flag dangerous chemicals earlier, identify pollution hotspots more precisely or focus inspections where problems are most likely to occur. Instead, AI is largely being treated as a productivity aid, not a mission-critical tool.

This isn’t just a missed opportunity — it’s a growing risk. Companies across the economy are rapidly adopting AI to improve efficiency, predict failures and optimize complex systems. If the EPA doesn’t keep pace, it risks becoming a referee who no longer understands the speed of the game. In a fast-moving field, that kind of mismatch matters.

One way forward can be found in the agency’s own past.

Three decades ago, the EPA launched Project XL, an initiative that encouraged companies to try new approaches, as long as they could demonstrate better environmental results. Instead of following rigid rules, participating companies were allowed to experiment with innovative methods that delivered stronger outcomes. The idea was simple: reward better performance, not just box-checking. It was meant to be a new paradigm for environmental regulation and provide a way of moving state-of-the-art technology into the mainstream.

That effort ultimately faded, weighed down by complexity, high costs and concerns about oversight. But the core idea remains sound — and may be even more relevant in the age of AI.

A modern version of Project XL could invite companies to use AI in ways that go beyond minimum expectations. Instead of reacting after problems occur, companies could use predictive tools to prevent them. AI could help fine-tune emissions controls, better match clean energy supply with demand, reduce reliance on backup generators or detect leaks and equipment failures before they become serious. Pilot projects could also show how complex environmental and health data can be made clearer and more accessible to the public, helping communities better understand what’s happening around them.

For the EPA to truly play a constructive role in the AI era, it needs to do more than remove obstacles for industry and cut red tape.

Administrator Zeldin must empower the agency to use AI to defend the environment with the same zeal he applies to cutting the protections that safeguard it and our communities. A carefully designed, next-generation version of that earlier experiment could help the agency learn alongside the private sector, without losing sight of its public purpose.

With global EV sales rising 28 per cent in 2025, BYD outsold Tesla for the first time on an annual basis, helped by rapid growth in Europe where the Chinese automaker has been widening its lead over the US rival.

The annual deliveries figure raises questions about whether Tesla can stabilise its core auto business following two consecutive years of sales declines, even as it pivots to futuristic projects such as robotics and self-driving cars to justify its steep valuation.

Tesla shares were marginally up in early trading.

“I think the market remains focused on the robotaxi business, where Tesla is testing its Cybercab in Austin,” said Mr Seth Goldstein, senior equity research analyst at Morningstar.

“If deliveries can continue to not be down too much in the coming quarters, I expect market sentiment around the robotaxi will continue to drive the stock,” Mr Goldstein added.

Tesla’s fourth-quarter figures come after third-quarter deliveries were supported by a rush to lock in US EV tax credits before they expired at the end of September, followed by a sharper slowdown as incentives rolled off.

EV demand has softened in the US since the end of September, when President Donald Trump’s administration ended US$7,500 (S$9,600) federal tax credits.

Tesla said it delivered 418,227 vehicles in the October–December quarter, down 15.6 per cent from 495,570 a year earlier. Analysts expected 434,487 vehicles or a 12.3 per cent drop, according to Visible Alpha.

For the full year, Tesla delivered 1.64 million vehicles, compared with 1.79 million in 2024. Analysts polled by Visible Alpha had expected deliveries of about 1.65 million vehicles, marking the company’s second consecutive annual decline.

Intensifying competition

Analysts have said Tesla came under immense pressure in 2025 in North America and Europe, where competition intensified and the company faced brand backlash due to CEO Elon Musk’s political rhetoric.

Growing competition from Chinese firms and European automakers such as Volkswagen and BMW has weighed on Tesla’s sales momentum.

BYD said sales outside of China climbed to a record 1 million vehicles in 2025, up about 150 per cent from 2024. The company has said it aimed to sell as many as 1.6 million vehicles outside China in 2026, though it has not disclosed an overall sales target.

Tesla in October launched stripped-down “Standard” versions of the Model Y and Model 3, priced about US$5,000 below the previous base models, as it sought to defend sales volumes after the tax credit loss and appeal to customers in Europe looking for cheaper options.

The move disappointed some investors who had expected a larger price cut or a meaningfully new mass-market product.

The American company led by Elon Musk logged 418,227 deliveries in the final three months of the year, taking its full-year sales figure to around 1.64 million EVs.

This marked a drop in sales of more than eight percent compared with 2024.

A day prior, BYD said that it sold 2.26 million EVs last year.

Analysts had expected Tesla's sales in the final quarter to slow less, to 449,000, according to a FactSet consensus.

The pullback comes amid the elimination of a $7,500 US tax credit at the end of September 2025, with industry watchers noting it will take time for EV demand to rebalance.

But even before then, Tesla had seen sales struggle in key markets over CEO Musk's political support of US President Donald Trump and other far-right politicians.

Tesla has also been grappling with rising competition from BYD and other Chinese companies, and from European giants.

Shenzhen-based BYD, which also produces hybrid cars, unveiled record EV sales in the past year on Thursday.

Known as ""Biyadi"" in Chinese -- or by the English slogan ""Build Your Dreams"" -- BYD was founded in 1995 and originally specialized in battery manufacturing.

The automotive juggernaut has come to dominate China's highly competitive market for new energy vehicles, a term used to describe various vehicles from fully electric ones to plug-in hybrids. China is the world's largest market for new energy vehicles.

BYD is now looking to expand its presence overseas, as increasingly price-wary consumption patterns in China weigh on profitability.

While BYD and other Chinese EV producers come up against hefty tariffs in the United States, the company's success is picking up in Southeast Asia, the Middle East and in Europe.

Tesla only narrowly beat BYD in annual EV sales in 2024, with US company's 1.79 million outpacing the latter's 1.76 million.

Nonetheless, Tesla shares ticked up in pre-market trading in New York on Friday.

Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities noted that Tesla's quarterly sales figure remained much better than some had speculated.

He flagged that the company faces a ""more difficult demand environment following the end of the EV tax credit while Europe remains a headwind to its deliveries.""

Ives noted that the company still sees challenges obtaining certain regulatory approval in Europe, with sales potentially rebounding once the regulatory hurdles are cleared.

""Sales around smaller and emerging markets have started to see larger growth metrics than expectations which look to offset the declines in key regions like China and Europe,"" he added.

The 21,000-member, Scott City-based co-op beat out three large investor-owned utilities in Michigan, New York and New Jersey in the final round to win top honors in the utilities category of the 2025 Drive Electric Awards. The awards are given by Plug In America, a national, nonprofit organization that advocates for affordable, accessible EVs and charging stations.

“Though small, Wheatland Electric Cooperative leads with innovation—bridging the gap in rural America and proving no community is too small, too rural, or too remote to be part of the clean transportation future,” the group said in announcing the award.

Since 2021, WEC has installed three ChargePoint® Level 2 public charging stations—with two charging ports each—across an area where no chargers existed within a 100-mile radius. As of October, the stations have supported more than 1,500 charging sessions by nearly 670 different drivers. The co-op created them at its own expense.

“We’re in a part of the country that’s often overlooked, simply because we’re so rural,” said Shajia Donecker, the co-op’s multimedia specialist. “We are always striving to put our region on the EV maps, and I think Plug In America recognized that.”

The co-op also invites community members to test drive EVs at special events, which included a “Dine and Drive” lunch in 2024 in Great Bend that attracted 150 people for a free lunch and a chance to get behind the wheel of three different types of EVs.

The co-op brought its own two electric vehicles—a Hyundai Kona and a Ford F-150 Lightning—and an employe shared his Tesla Model Y. The co-op’s member services team won NRECA’s 2025 Service Excellence Gold Award for creating the “best external event.”

This year, the co-op held “EVs & Espressos” events at or near several local coffee shops, providing free coffee to help entice people to explore EVs as part of National Drive Electric Month.

“Our whole goal is to make EVs more approachable,” said Alli Conine, WEC’s director of member services and corporate communications. “When we give people those hands-on experiences, their perspectives change. We want them to have fun while learning more about EVs.”

EVs are still relatively scarce in the area and no local car dealers display them, making the co-op events the only chance many residents have to test drive an EV, Donecker said.

“We try to meet people where they are,” she said. “You get all kinds of reactions. Some people will say, ‘no, absolutely not, I don’t want anything to do with an EV.’ But you also get, ‘wow, I had no idea how much power an EV has.” About 99% of the time, the reaction is good after they get a chance to drive.”

WEC’s grassroots efforts have focused on EV “accessibility, reliability, and cost savings to resonate locally,” Plug In America said.

“Beyond consumers, Wheatland has provided training and education to first responders, chambers of commerce, and civic leaders. The co-op is also electrifying its fleet, mentoring cooperatives in Kansas and Oklahoma, and providing a replicable playbook for other rural coops across the U.S.”

While other states have filed lawsuits in an effort to keep their funding, South Carolina did not.","South Carolina lawmakers and utility executives have been grappling with how to meet the state’s growing power needs. But the state has been slow to make use of federal programs that aid the energy crunch from another direction — by reducing the amount of power used.

That could change, pending final approval from the U.S. Department of Energy.

South Carolina’s Energy Office is expected to award the operator contract for a pair of consumer rebate programs by Jan. 14, according to a state procurement notice, nearly 3½ years after the passage of the Biden administration’s hallmark clean energy package that funded them.

How long it will take for the state’s $137 million share to go out after the contractor is chosen remains to be seen. The federal energy agency has left other states in limbo for months.

What the programs do

The Home Electrification and Appliance Rebates program reimburses up to $14,000 to low- and middle-income residents who install high-efficiency electric appliances in their homes.

Another program is available to homeowners of all income levels. The Home Efficiency Rebates program, dubbed HOMES, pays for home improvements. That could include insulating and sealing homes or installing smart thermostats that automatically reduce heating and cooling use during hours when no one is home.

While any homeowner can apply for HOMES, low-income families are allowed the biggest rebates. Caps range from $2,000 to $16,000, depending on applicants’ income and their project’s estimated energy savings.

Renters may be eligible for either program with written permission from the property owner, according to the state Energy Office.

And residents that meet income eligibility, earning no more than one and a half times the area median income for their county, can apply for funding under both programs. To qualify for appliance rebates in Richland County, for example, a household income can’t exceed $139,000. In Charleston County, the income cap is about $166,000. In Greenville County, it’s about $146,000.

South Carolina’s share of the federal funding package is to be split almost evenly between the two programs, according to a database maintained by Atlas Public Policy, a Washington, D.C., climate policy research firm.

Where the programs stand

A handful of states had fully executed contracts and access to funding before President Joe Biden left office. Five states, including North Carolina and Georgia, as well as Washington, D.C., already have both programs in place, according to the database. Seven other states have at least one of the programs in operation.

North Carolina’s programs have been running since Jan. 16, 2025. Georgia started with a pilot program in November 2024 and began full operations in March 2025.

As of Dec. 2, 2025, Georgia had paid out $1.9 million total to 184 households under the appliance-rebate program. Its HOMES program had awarded 684 households a total of $7.1 million, according to the state’s online dashboard.

North Carolina is rolling its programs out one county at a time. As of June 13, the state had received more than 4,100 applications.

But the U.S. Department of Energy has slow-walked a review of Biden-era funding, leaving the remaining 36 states and five territories that applied wondering whether their share of funding will actually come.

South Carolina’s Energy Office started the application process near the end of September 2023, which included opting to participate. Nearly 1½ years later, in mid-January 2025, the U.S. Department of Energy gave the initial funding nod, but the state still had to come up with a plan for how to give those funds out and what to focus the spending on.

Five days later, President Donald Trump took office.

On day one, the president signed an executive order freezing clean energy-related funding in the previous administration’s massive energy and infrastructure laws. This threw the future of the two energy efficiency programs into question, alongside several other initiatives, including grants for solar programs that help low-income communities and funding to expand the availability of public electric vehicle chargers along the U.S. interstate system.

In early June, Secretary of Energy Chris Wright told a U.S. House energy panel that his agency’s review was ongoing.

“By the end of this summer or middle of this summer, we are going to have clarity on most of the big projects,” Wright said.

But where the energy efficiency rebates fit into that review is unclear, and nothing appears to have changed since that hearing.

South Carolina joined the queue near the end of July, submitting its plan for final approval.

While the Energy Office is prepared to select a contractor, it too will remain on hold until federal sign-offs resume.

Other programs

As for those other energy-related programs, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency announced in August it was terminating a $124 million Solar For All grant won by South Carolina’s Office of Resilience. While other states have filed lawsuits in an effort to keep their funding, South Carolina did not.

The state Office of Resilience was still in its first year of planning when the funding was pulled, so the agency had yet to work out details for spending the grant.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin pointed to a provision in Republican’s “One, Big, Beautiful” spending package repealing the fund that housed the money.

​“EPA no longer has the authority to administer the program, or the appropriated funds to keep this boondoggle alive,” Zeldin said in a video posted to social media.

The provision applied only to “unobligated” funds, however, and the states suing to hold on to the money argue the environmental agency had awarded all $7 billion of the program’s grant money.

SC can restart electric vehicle charging program after federal funding restored

Court battles also took place earlier in 2025 over electric vehicle charging funds.

The Federal Highway Administration stopped sending out dollars for the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure program, known as NEVI, in February.

Twenty states, the District of Columbia and half a dozen environmental groups sued the Trump administration over the paused funding. The money remained on ice until a federal judge, in June, ordered the freeze be lifted.

In August, the highway agency sent notices out to states, letting them know they could reapply.

The agency has since approved South Carolina’s new application.

The state is eligible for about $70 million and will start looking for contractors to build charging stations sometime in 2026, according to the state’s transportation department.",https://cdn.newsfromthestates.com/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-47658/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/electrician-1024x7681767366436.jpg?h=ddb1ad0c&itok=5Yoml9hD,N,,2026-01-02 10:59:24.231030

Other types include colocation data centers rented by multiple companies, edge data centers designed to reduce latency, and private facilities that serve individual organizations such as hospitals. Dimitrios Nikolopoulos, the John W. Hancock Professor of engineering at Virginia Tech, whose state is home to one of the country's highest concentrations of data centers in what's become known as Data Center Alley, said data centers aren't one-size-fits-all.

""They range from sprawling hyperscale campuses — think the size of several football fields — to compact, container-sized outdoor installations or enterprise sites. Hyperscale facilities can draw 100 MW or more, comparable to the electricity use of tens of thousands of homes, and can reshape land use, soak up local grid capacity, and place big demands on water supplies,"" Nikolopoulos said. ""On the other end of the spectrum, smaller, distributed 'mini' or outdoor centers can tuck into industrial parks or campus corners, with a lighter physical footprint and more modest infrastructure needs. Personally, I think we should encourage a shift toward many smaller, nimble facilities that sit close to where data is generated and used— not just a handful of mega-farms isolated in the middle of nowhere.""

More data centers are being built to keep up with the demand for e-commerce, streaming, social media, gaming and other uses, Asare said. AI in particular has created more demand at a rapid pace, but more data center capacity is also needed to handle the increased volume of traffic websites like Amazon are getting, he said.

""Data centers are the underlying infrastructure of the digital age,"" Asare said. ""The scale of computing power is increasing so rapidly.""

Tech giants are building larger data centers not only because of the growing demand for data but also because it's more efficient and cost-effective to build one large data center rather than several small data centers, Asare said. Despite price tags that run into hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars to build them, massive data centers reduce the per-unit cost, he said.

The impact on local communities and the environment can vary widely, depending on the size and scope, as well as on how the data center is powered and cooled, Nikolopoulos said.

""When it comes to environmental impact, cooling, power, and siting are the big levers. Air-cooled sites in hot, dry places can gulp down a lot of energy — and often water — while modern liquid or immersion cooling can sharply cut both energy and noise. Companies like Microsoft and Nvidia are already pushing chip-level and liquid-cooling designs that reduce water use and cooling energy for AI data centers,"" Nikolopoulos said.

He added that data centers that combine efficient liquid-cooling systems with renewable energy and are located on already developed industrial land can significantly reduce environmental impacts. Locating near existing substations or industrial zones also means less strain on the grid and less need for new construction, he said.

""We’re also going to see them being more aggressive on-chip cooling, tiny fluid channels built into the silicon, 3D-stacked packages with integrated liquid loops, and phase-change materials near hot spots,"" said Nikolopoulos. ""That helps pull heat directly from the source, so you can pack far more AI compute into each rack while shrinking everything else: size, noise and energy use included.""

How much water and power will data centers use?

Residents have raised concerns that data centers can consume huge quantities of water. Asare said there's wide variation in how much water data centers use, depending largely on design. Data centers that use evaporative methods are a cause for concern, but in most cases the water is discharged after it's used for cooling, he said.

A closed-loop cooling system is ideal, as it ensures all the water is returned to the source, Asare said. Local governments need to look at putting in requirements about water usage during the permitting process, to ensure, for instance, that it's discharged back to the source and not allowed to evaporate, he said.

Data centers use so much water that they can put stress on aquifers, but likely would not do much to drain abundant sources of water like Lake Michigan, Asare said.

Hyperscale data centers can guzzle significant amounts of water, but can be designed to minimize water consumption, Nikolopoulos said.

""Big data centers can be very thirsty — especially those using evaporative cooling in hot climates — but actual water use depends heavily on design and location. A typical large hyperscale facility can consume on the order of a few hundred thousand gallons of water per day for cooling, and some proposed or extreme cases are in the millions of gallons per day, comparable to a town of tens of thousands of people,"" Nikolopoulos said. ""By contrast, air-cooled or closed-loop liquid systems can drive direct cooling water use close to zero in many climates, and Microsoft’s latest designs aim for zero water cooling for AI-heavy sites. Personally, I think any new data center, especially in water-stressed regions, should stick to strict water budgets or go water-free entirely, and smaller, high-density systems make this much more practical.""

A common concern among residents is that data centers will drain groundwater or harm Lake Michigan, the main source of drinking water for the Chicago metro area which is home to around 9.5 million people. Since data centers use water strictly to cool computer servers, the main source of pollution is heat, Asare said. Data centers discharge heated water back into the source, which can adversely affect aquatic life.

Steady discharges can raise temperatures, making it uncomfortable for fish and plant life.

""The biggest worries are about heat and treatment chemicals from cooling systems getting into local water, or pulling so much water that it disrupts local hydrology. Poorly managed facilities could warm rivers or lakes or leak biocides and anti-corrosion chemicals if discharge isn’t tightly controlled,"" Nikolopoulos said. ""Around major freshwater bodies like the Great Lakes, some proposed data center projects have raised alarms for their planned withdrawals from sources like Lake Michigan and their potential impacts on already stressed watersheds. In those locations, I’d push for strict regulation, closed-loop or low-water cooling wherever possible, and clear, public monitoring of every withdrawal and discharge. Opting for smaller, modular centers that use little or no water is a much safer bet.""

What do data centers mean for utilities and land use?

Residents who spoke at meetings earlier this year in Starke County said they worry about energy consumption and how data centers could drive up electric bills. Data centers consume vast quantities of power, Asare said. They currently use around 5% of the nation's electricity, a figure that's expected to skyrocket to 12% by 2028, according to the U.S. Department of Energy.

Data centers often will require new infrastructure, such as new electric power generation and new transmission lines, Asare said. Agreements are needed to ensure the data center operators foot those costs to spare ratepayers, he said. Renewable energy power purchase agreements can require that wind and solar be used to minimize the carbon footprint.

They tend to consume large amounts of energy, due in part to running around the clock 24/7, Asare said.

Large data centers typically require the addition of new electric capacity generation. NIPSCO, for instance, plans to build 3 GW of new capacity to accommodate Amazon Web Services' plans for a major data center campus in Hobart.

""Data centers pack a serious energy punch, and a big facility can quickly drive up local electricity demand if the grid isn’t ready for it. For example, a 100-MW hyperscale campus can use as much power as tens of thousands to around 100,000 households, putting real pressure on regional grids,"" Nikolopoulos said.

High energy usage and new infrastructure costs can be passed on to existing ratepayers, depending on how the data centers are handled.

""My preference? Spread things out with lots of smaller, efficient edge or enterprise centers that fit the local grid, team up with renewables or waste-heat users (for example, feeding heat into district networks), and actively work with utilities,"" Nikolopoulos said. ""That way, they can be flexible, grid-friendly neighbors — not giant, inflexible energy hogs.""

Residents express fears that data centers will drive up electric bills, which have been soaring in Northwest Indiana and around the nation. The U.S. Energy Information Administration reports electricity costs have jumped by 7.4% over the past year.

""Data centers are driving increased investment by utilities in generation, transmission and energy storage,"" University of Chicago Professor of Computer Science Andrew A. Chien said. ""These investments must be covered by the ratepayers, and there is also increased competition for power. There are several examples of areas where auctions for future power supplies have already jumped dramatically — showing increases to come. So power prices are going to go up, with data center power growth as a major cause.""

Studies that have not found a correlation between data centers and increased energy bills are flawed, Chien said.

""While done by good researchers, these studies are backward looking and don't accurately capture the macro effects that data center power growth is driving increased power prices,"" he said.

Can communities limit noise and light impacts?

Noise pollution has also been brought before city councils and other local officials. Data centers do generate an audible hum that varies depending on the size, Asare said. Fan, cooling equipment and backup generators all can create noise. Experts say it can be mitigated with shrubbery, building setbacks and other techniques to minimize the effect on neighbors.

Many municipalities have noise regulations that require 45 decibels or fewer at night and could seek to further regulate data centers to ensure they don't disrupt nearby homes or neighborhoods, Asare said.

The volume of noise can vary depending on the size of the data center and it can be mitigated, Nikolopoulos said.

""Traditional air-cooled data centers can be pretty noisy, especially when they’re big and running at full tilt — you’ll often hear a steady low hum from fans and chillers,"" he said. ""This is typically in the 60 to 75 decibel range at the fence line, comparable to loud conversation or busy street noise. But this isn’t inevitable. With smart building design, acoustic barriers and newer cooling methods like direct liquid cooling (which reduces reliance on huge air handlers), noise can be dialed way down. Small, outdoor, or modular centers are even easier to make quiet, as long as noise is treated as a top-tier design constraint from the start.""

Light

Residents, especially those who live in rural areas, have said they worry about light emanating from data centers, including at public hearings in Starke and Porter counties. Security or perimeter lights are not unique to data centers and could be found on any comparable commercial or industrial building, Asare said. Barriers of shrubs and other techniques can be required to shield neighbors. Communities could require warmer colors, mandate motion control or ban stadium-style lighting during the review process, he said.

The lighting is akin to what one might find on a large building like a supermarket, home improvement or big box store, Nikolopoulos said.

""Most of the visible light impact comes from security lighting, not from the servers themselves,"" he said. ""Poorly designed sites can create light pollution that annoys neighbors and confuses wildlife, but this is a very solvable problem. With shielded fixtures, downward-facing LEDs, and smart lighting controls, a data center can be almost invisible after dark — something already implemented at many Nordic and campus-style sites. Smaller, spread-out centers are easier to blend into their surroundings with thoughtful lighting than massive, highly visible campuses.""

What is the impact on property values?

Hammond residents earlier this year expressed worry about data centers sinking property values. Asare said data centers could affect the resaleability of a home if it was close enough, but would not necessarily affect the value, merely the perception among some buyers. Having one in the community could end up being a boon for property values if it resulted in more tech companies and jobs, increasing the economic opportunity in town, he said.

Nikolopoulos said it comes down to location, location, location.

""Property values depend a lot on context. A huge, noisy, visually intrusive data center right next to homes can depress nearby residential values; we’ve seen that concern in fast-growing data center hubs in Virginia and Texas,"" he said. ""Put the same facility in an industrial or commercial zone with good buffers and design, and it can have neutral or even positive effects through job creation and a stronger tax base. Personally, I think the smart move is to keep the very large sites away from neighborhoods and focus on smaller, human-scale edge or enterprise centers that fit naturally into mixed-use or commercial areas.""

How will data centers affect nearby neighborhoods?

Residents also fear new development will disrupt wildlife habitats, driving out deer, turtles, birds and other fauna. The four homeowners who sued to block data centers in Hobart specifically raised concerns about migrating birds and families of deer that frequent their properties. Data centers could fragment habitats, but no more than any other massive development would, Asare said. The night lighting could affect nocturnal species like owls, birds could vary their migration patterns and discharges could affect heat levels, affecting aquatic life.

Locating data centers in already developed areas instead of greenfield sites can help preserve habitats for flora and fauna, Nikolopoulos said. Data centers in Scandinavia minimize impact on the natural environment with careful siting, low-noise cooling and dark-sky lighting.

""Wildlife feels the effects of data centers mostly through land conversion, noise, heat, light, and water use,"" he said. ""Building a large campus on undeveloped land can fragment habitats and disrupt migration routes. By contrast, compact, modular centers sited on already-developed sites — parking lots, brownfields, rooftops, or former industrial properties — cause very little additional habitat loss.""

The company was also out-sold by China-based chief rival BYD, which is likely the biggest seller of EVs for 2025

Tesla's rough year took it to its second straight annual sales decline.

Elon Musk's electric vehicle maker on Friday posted deliveries well below Wall Street's already-low expectations.

Austin, Texas-based Tesla (TSLA) said it delivered 418,227 vehicles to customers between October and December, compared with the 440,000 expected by Wall Street, according to FactSet estimates. Earlier this week, the company published a consensus of sell-side analyst expectations that forecast 422,850 units sold. Compared with a year earlier, Tesla's December quarter sales dropped 16%.

For 2025, Tesla's sold 1.63 million vehicles, falling short of the 1.78 million vehicles it delivered in 2024 and the 1.8 million sold in 2023. It's the company's second straight annual decline. When Tesla in 2024 failed to match its 2023 performance, it was the company's first year-over-year sales drop since 2011.

On Thursday, Tesla rival BYD said its sales of battery electric vehicles rose 27% to 2.25 million, while plug-in hybrid car sales fell 7% to 2.25 million. The Chinese automaker's unaudited results would make it the biggest global seller of battery-powered vehicles for 2025.

Earlier: China's BYD just raised the bar on EV sales. Tesla may struggle to catch up.

Tesla shares were up by almost 2% in premarket trading after the company's sales announcement.

Tesla sold 406,585 Model Y sport-utility vehicles and Model 3 sedans, which overwhelmingly account for the bulk of its sales, last quarter. The company also sold 11,642 other vehicles, which it groups together when reporting deliveries. That includes the Model X SUV, Model S sedan and Cybertruck pickup truck.

Last year saw Tesla struggle in Europe after consumers rejected the company, largely over Musk's embrace of far-right political figures. It's also been losing market share to expanding Chinese automakers scooping up market share in Europe and China.

Sales in the U.S. got a boost in the third quarter as consumers took advantage of tax credits that expired at the end of September. Gene Munster, managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management, estimates that added 55,000 deliveries to Tesla's record quarter that would have otherwise been spread through the following two quarters.

Analysts expect U.S. electric car sales to be slightly weaker over the next few quarters as affordability remains a barrier for some consumers to purchase EVs. That will impact EV sellers across the industry, although some expect Tesla to ultimately benefit.

""Only brands with strong products, cost discipline, and loyalty are positioned to keep/gain [market] share. That's a good thing for Tesla,"" wrote Canaccord Genuity analyst George Gianarikas in Dec. 22 note to investors.

Despite the company's focus on artificial-intelligence, the EV business still accounts for the majority of Tesla's revenue. Analysts expect Tesla to report $70.8 billion in automotive revenue for 2025, down from $77 billion a year earlier, according to FactSet estimates.

Tesla on Friday also said it delivered a record 14.2 gigawatt-hours of energy storage products in the December quarter, showing the growth of its energy business. Its previous record was set in the third quarter of 2025, when it deployed 12.5 GWh of energy storage products.

____ This story has been corrected to show that BYD sold 2.26 million vehicles last year, not 2.26.","NEW YORK (AP) — Tesla lost its crown as the world’s bestselling electric vehicle maker on Friday as a customer revolt over Elon Musk’s right-wing politics, expiring U.S. tax breaks for buyers and stiff overseas competition pushed sales down for a second year in a row.

Tesla said that it delivered 1.64 million vehicles in 2025, down 9% from a year earlier.

Chinese rival BYD, which sold 2.26 million vehicles last year, is now the biggest EV maker.

It’s a stunning reversal for Musk who once dismissed BYD as a threat as Tesla’s rise seemed unstoppable, crushing traditional automakers with far more resources and helping make him the world’s richest man.

For the fourth quarter, sales totaled 418,227, falling short of the 440,000 that analysts polled by FactSet expected. The sales total was impacted by the expiration of a $7,500 tax credit that was phased out by the Trump administration at the end of September.

Tesla stock was up 0.5% at $451.60 in early trading Friday.

Even with multiple issues buffeting the company, investors are betting that Tesla CEO Musk can deliver on his ambitions to make Tesla a leader in robotaxi service and get consumers to embrace humanoid robots that can perform basic tasks in homes and offices. Reflecting that optimism, the stock finished 2025 with a gain of approximately 11%.

The latest quarter was the first with sales of stripped-down versions of the Model Y and Model 3 that Musk unveiled in early October as part of an effort to revive sales. The new Model Y costs just under $40,000 while customers can buy the cheaper Model 3 for under $37,000. Those versions are expected to help Tesla compete with Chinese models in Europe and Asia.

For fourth-quarter earnings coming out in late January, analysts are expecting the company to post a 3% drop in sales and a nearly 40% drop in earnings per share, according to FactSet. Analysts expect the downward trend in sales and profits to eventually reverse itself as 2026 rolls along.

Investors have largely shrugged off the falling numbers, choosing to focus on Musk’s pivot to different parts of business.

He has been saying that plunging car sales don’t matter as much now because the future of the company lies more with his new driverless robotaxis service, the company’s energy storage business and building robots for the home and factory. To make his task worthwhile, Tesla’s directors awarded Musk a potentially enormous new pay package that shareholders backed at the annual meeting in November.

Musk scored another huge windfall two weeks ago when the Delaware Supreme Court reversed a decision that deprived him of a $55 billion pay package that Tesla doled out in 2018.

Musk could become the world’s first trillionaire later this year when he sells shares of his rocket company SpaceX to public for the first time in what analysts expect would be a blockbuster initial public offering. ____

Global electricity demand is now rising far faster than overall energy consumption.
As Birol noted, electricity demand growth, rooted for decades in household appliances, industrial processes, and air conditioning, is now being accelerated by “artificial intelligence, air conditioners, and electric cars driving further the global electricity demand growth.” However, the scale of the shift is unprecedented.
While electricity still accounts for roughly 20% of global final energy use, it already “supplies energy to more than 40% of the global economy,” he said.
“The electricity demand growth is 10,000 TWh—the electricity that is consumed today in the U.S., Canada, all of Europe, Japan, Korea, Australia, all advanced economies, combined.","IEA’s World Energy Outlook 2025 shows the global power system entering the “Age of Electricity,” with demand accelerating faster than grids, reshaping fuel mixes, investment flows, and energy security priorities.

The world has firmly crossed into the “Age of Electricity.” That is a unifying finding in the International Energy Agency’s (IEA’s) 2025 edition of the World Energy Outlook (WEO), which shows a global power sector being reshaped simultaneously by surging demand, a geographic pivot in consumption, record solar manufacturing capacity, a wave of liquefied natural gas (LNG) export development, heightened energy security concerns, and a widening gap between generation deployment and grid readiness.

1. The Age of Electricity. As IEA Executive Director Dr. Fatih Birol observed at the report’s launch, the shift reflects the sector’s rapid pivot away from a period dominated by fossil fuel price volatility and post-pandemic overcapacity toward structurally accelerating electricity demand. For years, “IEA has been saying that the electricity demand is growing very strongly among all the fuels, and recently we said the world may enter the age of electricity, and looking at the data today in the WEO I think we can comfortably say that the age of electricity has arrived,” Birol said.

Global electricity demand is now rising far faster than overall energy consumption. Demand has already increased near 3% per year over the past decade, almost twice the growth rate of total energy demand, and accelerated to more than 4% in 2024. Under the IEA’s Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS)—which reflects current and announced government policies (without assuming future targets are achieved)—electricity consumption expands by nearly 1,000 TWh annually through 2035, driven by growing industrial electrification, rising appliance ownership, expanding cooling demand, electric vehicles (EVs), and data center growth. As Birol noted, electricity demand growth, rooted for decades in household appliances, industrial processes, and air conditioning, is now being accelerated by “artificial intelligence, air conditioners, and electric cars driving further the global electricity demand growth.”

However, the scale of the shift is unprecedented. While electricity still accounts for roughly 20% of global final energy use, it already “supplies energy to more than 40% of the global economy,” he said. IEA Director of Sustainability, Technology, and Outlooks Laura Cozzi further underscored the cumulative magnitude: “Electricity demand growth from now to 2035 is nearly identical in our STEPS and [Current Policies Scenario (CPS)],” which sets out a pathway for the future of the energy system in which there is no change in energy-related policies scenarios, she said. “The electricity demand growth is 10,000 TWh—the electricity that is consumed today in the U.S., Canada, all of Europe, Japan, Korea, Australia, all advanced economies, combined. That’s added in just 10 years. This is a very, very big shift that will demand a lot of investment and planning.”

2. Geographic Pivot—China to India, Southeast Asia. However, the report suggests the global center of electricity demand growth is shifting decisively away from China toward India and Southeast Asia, driven by stark demographic divergence and evolving consumption patterns. “China has reached a peak in population, and we are expecting that by 2035, China will have around 50 million people less than today, reaching the type of demographic structure that we see in advanced economies such as Japan or Italy,” Cozzi said. At the same time, she noted, “We are seeing this passing of the baton to other emerging economies—to India and Southeast Asia, where we receive 230 million more people living there.” The consumer transition is already evident: “Over 50% of car sales in the next decade will happen in emerging and developing economies outside of China—a very profound shift compared to the past decade where this was happening in China.”

Investment flows, however, remain uneven. In the U.S., enactment of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act has tightened foreign-content rules and revised tax credits affecting clean power, carbon capture, EVs, efficiency programs, and critical minerals. Globally, total energy investment reached $3.3 trillion in 2025 (more than 20% greater than 2015 levels) and is now roughly two-thirds directed toward low-emissions technologies, primarily driven by energy security concerns. Yet most capital remains concentrated in China, the U.S., and Europe, while Africa and Latin America continue to lag despite accelerating demand. Southeast Asia, notably, stands out as a fast-emerging growth pole, with electricity consumption rising 7% to 1,300 TWh in 2024 and projected to reach 2,100 TWh by 2035, driving new generation additions across natural gas, coal, wind, solar, and storage.

3. Reshaping the Electricity Mix—All Fuels in Transition. The global power-generation mix is undergoing a rapid structural shift across all fuel types. Under the IEA’s STEPS (Figure 1), the share of fossil fuels in electricity is slated to fall from about 60% in 2024 to below 40% by 2035, and to just 20% by mid-century. Renewables, now roughly one-third of global generation, surpass 50% by 2035 and exceed two-thirds by 2050, driven primarily by wind and solar, whose combined share rises from 15% today to 40% by 2035 and 55% by 2050.

Nuclear will maintain a steady share—just under 10% of global generation—supported by uprates, plant restarts, and new construction, particularly in the U.S., France, and Japan. After two decades of stagnation, global nuclear capacity is projected to expand by at least one-third by 2035, with more than 70 GW currently under construction worldwide, among the highest build rates in 30 years. In advanced economies, nuclear accounts for nearly 10% of incremental electricity demand growth to 2035, while generation in emerging market and developing economies is expected to roughly double over the same period as countries look to firm low-emissions supply alongside variable renewables.

The report suggests, crucially, that in advanced economies, low-emissions power generation could grow about 50% faster than electricity demand through 2035, while in emerging economies (where power demand is slated to climb roughly 50% over the period), low-emissions sources could expand even faster. China accounts for two-thirds of the increase. Coal remains the most significant single power source in developing markets by 2035, despite declining utilization, while gas-fired generation continues to grow to provide flexible capacity.

Still, solar is slated to remain the dominant growth technology within that transition. “Solar is going to play a pivotal role here,” Birol said. “Big growth coming from solar. It is also important to see that the bulk of electricity demand growth will come from countries where we see a huge amount of solar radiation—solar-rich countries.” Solar supplies about 60% of incremental demand growth across emerging economies, but integration challenges are mounting. “Curtailment of wind and solar output is on the rise, as are incidences of negative pricing in wholesale markets, but slow permitting is holding back grid projects,” he said. At the same time, supply chains are outpacing deployment: “In 2024, there was sufficient manufacturing capacity to have produced more than twice as many solar PV modules as were actually deployed, and almost three times as many battery cells.”

4. Gas Power’s Resurgence—and the LNG Wave. The global natural gas market, meanwhile, is being reshaped both by record LNG investment and by a sharp rebound in gas-fired power generation across fast-growing electricity regions. As IEA Chief Energy Economist Tim Gould noted, “2025 has been a really remarkable year for approvals of new LNG export facilities. This year we’ve seen almost 100 billion cubic meters [Bcm] worth of new export projects approved—just short of the all-time record we saw in 2019.” He added, “If we stack up all of those existing and new projects from the U.S., Qatar, Canada, and elsewhere, we have 300 billion cubic meters of new capacity coming onto the market.”

Bolstering the build-out is rapidly rising demand for gas-fired electricity. In emerging Asia alone, about 35% of incremental natural gas demand through 2035 comes from the power sector, supporting nearly 270 GW of new gas generation capacity—an increase of about 70% over current levels. China is slated to add roughly 200 Bcm of new demand, while India could nearly double it to 140 Bcm by 2035, driven largely by power generation and city-gas expansion. The Middle East contributes another 240 Bcm of demand growth linked primarily to electricity and industrial use. LNG has already overtaken pipelines as the dominant mode of long-distance gas trade, with supply flows increasingly aimed at these growth markets.

Lower prices will help to bring gas into markets like India, where imports double to 2030, and Southeast Asia, where they triple, Gould said. Still, “That is not enough to absorb all of the new LNG that’s coming to market in the STEPS,” Gould warned. He added, “There’s really ample potential for more coal-to-gas switching, but the sorts of prices you would need to make that switch an economic proposition are very difficult for LNG exporters to match.”

5. Energy Security & Critical Minerals. The WEO finds energy security now extends beyond fuel supply to the mineral and technology supply chains essential to modern power systems. In 2024, 91% of rare earth element refining occurred in a single country, and even if all planned projects are completed, that share would fall only to 75% by 2035. China remains the dominant refiner for 19 of 20 strategic energy minerals, while the top three producers control an average 86% of global refining capacity, creating growing vulnerability across clean-energy supply chains.

“Even if we assume that all projects that are planned or under construction are implemented successfully, this 91% goes only to 75% in 10 years—still a very big concentration in one country,” Birol warned. As electrification accelerates worldwide, he added, “Energy security is now similar at the same level as economic security and national security in many cases.”

6. System Integration & Flexibility. Finally, as generation capacity surges worldwide, grid investment and system flexibility are struggling to keep pace. “Investments in electricity generation have charged ahead by almost 70% since 2015 to reach $1 trillion per year, but annual grid spending has risen at less than half the pace to $400 billion,” the WEO notes. Operational friction is mounting, it suggests. Growing curtailment and negative pricing signal widening system integration constraints, while accelerating battery deployment addresses short-term needs but remains insufficient to meet rising seasonal flexibility requirements.

And, while storage is scaling rapidly, it remains only a partial solution. “Battery storage additions rose to more than 75 GW in 2024, but batteries cannot provide all the answers—especially where seasonal flexibility needs rise alongside short-term ones.” Additional flexibility is expected from consumers: “Demand response activation grows more than threefold by 2035, driven by participation from buildings and transport sectors through smart air conditioners, heat pumps, and EVs.”",https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/lightbulb-pixabay-1024x683.png,N,,2026-01-02 09:58:52.951364

Tax credits and financing Helene costs will help mitigate energy bill changes beginning in 2026

GREENVILLE, S.C., Jan. 2, 2026 /PRNewswire/ -- Beginning in January, Duke Energy will implement changes to customer bills that reflect investments made to recover from the historic damage from Hurricane Helene, strengthen the grid against storms and outages, maintain and upgrade its power generating fleet, and serve a growing customer base while supporting economic growth in South Carolina.

Our view: ""Duke Energy is committed to meeting the expectations our customers have around reliability, responsiveness and value – striking the right balance that delivers these at the lowest possible cost for customers,"" said Tim Pearson, Duke Energy's South Carolina president. ""That means investing in what matters, delivering results efficiently, and remaining transparent about what customers are paying for and why.""

The Public Service Commission of South Carolina (PSCSC) recently approved these updates for customers of Duke Energy Carolinas (DEC) and Duke Energy Progress (DEP), the company's two utilities in the state.

Recovering from Helene: Securitization – selling low-interest, long-term bonds – is one way Duke Energy can generate savings and keep costs lower for customers while also recovering large and unexpected expenses like those that resulted from Hurricane Helene. The PSCSC recently approved a securitization plan that will save DEC customers more than $140 million on Helene expenses.

Beginning in January, a typical residential DEC customer using 1,000 kilowatt-hours (kWh) of electricity per month will see a new storm charge on bills reflecting a 3.2% increase, or $4.58. This modest increase still delivers 20% savings for customers over the recovery period compared to traditional cost recovery methods.

""We appreciate the legislature providing tools like securitization to address extreme storm costs as we continue to pursue ways to reduce these impacts on customer bills,"" Pearson said.

Powering growth, driving reliability: Duke Energy has made investments in the things our customers expect: upgrades to strengthen the grid, improve reliability and storm resilience, and maintain and upgrade our generation fleet. These investments are already in place and delivering benefits to South Carolina, from faster restoration times to improved reliability and operational efficiency.

For example, as part of ongoing grid upgrades, Duke Energy has nearly tripled the number of South Carolina customers served by self-healing technology over the past two years, with more than 70% of customers now benefiting from this innovative automated power restoration tool.

""Meeting the needs of our customers means prioritizing investments that enhance the grid while also minimizing the cost impact for customers,"" Pearson said. ""For example, Duke Energy's nuclear units are expected to generate hundreds of millions of dollars of annual tax credits in the coming years – savings that will be passed to our customers beginning in 2026.""

Bottom line: The PSCSC recently approved comprehensive agreements between diverse groups of stakeholders that will apply these tax credits to bills and include shareholder-funded contributions to residential customers, helping to mitigate the impacts of recent infrastructure investments on customer bills over the next two years.

DEP: Beginning Feb. 1, monthly electric bills for typical DEP residential customers using 1,000 kWh per month will increase about $11.20 a month – from $153.82 per month to $165.02.

DEC: Beginning March 1, monthly electric bills for typical DEC residential customers using 1,000 kWh per month will increase about $0.84 a month – from $148.02 per month to $148.86 (this includes the securitization charge previously mentioned).

DEC serves about 680,000 households and businesses primarily in Upstate and north central South Carolina, including Greenville, Anderson and York counties, while DEP serves about 177,000 customers in the Pee Dee region and northeastern South Carolina, including Sumter, Florence and Darlington counties. If approved by regulators in 2026, the proposed combination of the two utilities would save customers in the Carolinas more than $1 billion in future costs.

Helping customers manage costs: ""Customers expect us to manage our costs, but they also want options to manage their own energy usage and give them tools to impact their own bills,"" Pearson said. ""That's why we're helping customers lower their energy use – and lower their bills – through programs that make a measurable difference.""

Across the Carolinas, Duke Energy's aggressive energy efficiency programs deliver annual savings 150% better than the national average. Improving efficiency benefits all customers by reducing costs for the entire system. In South Carolina, the company recently increased the incentives of many of these programs, expanding ways customers can save money.

Why should I care?

For markets: The future story is strong but the car business sets the math.

Tesla shares were up about 11% in 2025 despite weaker deliveries, suggesting investors are putting more weight on robotaxis, self-driving software, and robotics than on near-term EV sales. But repeated delivery declines typically mean more discounting, which can compress margins and make earnings more sensitive to volume. The key question for markets is whether Tesla can stabilize its core auto demand without permanently training customers to wait for the next price cut.

Zooming out: Subsidies don’t just boost sales they reshape them.

The Q3 pull-forward and Q4 hangover show how policy can shift demand across quarters, then leave a tougher baseline once incentives vanish. When that happens, automakers often choose between slowing production or cutting prices to keep factories busy – neither is great for profitability.

Conservation groups and legislators alike are looking to take another bite of the apple on several $50-million bond issues and settle emerging issues with wastewater sludge at the state-owned Juniper Ridge Landfill in Old Town when lawmakers convene again this month.

As in 2025, the mitigation of “forever chemicals” is at the forefront of many 2026 legislative proposals, along with support for the wastewater treatment facilities that confront them daily.

Several forestry industry advocates are also hoping that the Legislature affirms its support of Maine loggers and provides them financial relief amid challenging market conditions.

Conservation and infrastructure funding

— L.D. 362: An Act to Authorize a General Fund Bond Issue to Replenish the Land for Maine’s Future Program

Lead sponsor Sen. Russell Black (R-Wilton) is proposing a $50 million bond to replenish Maine’s conservation program and help purchase high-value agricultural land, critical wildlife habitat and public access points to Maine’s coast.

Without this bond, Maine will lose even more land to development, taking the state’s dwindling rural workforce of farmers along with it, Black wrote in legislative testimony.

“As a farmer and a fiscal conservative, I believe we should only spend taxpayer dollars when it’s absolutely necessary and when it delivers real, lasting value — and protecting Maine’s farmland does just that,” Black said.

— L.D. 836: An Act to Authorize a General Fund Bond Issue to Upgrade Municipal Culverts at Stream Crossings

Another bill — this time from Senate President Mattie Daughtry (D-Brunswick) — would dedicate a $50 million bond to Maine municipalities looking to replace or expand their aging, undersized culverts that channel water under or around roads.

Culverts can be an achilles heel for municipalities facing heavy rainstorms and floods. Roads blow out when they’re overwhelmed and undermined, stranding residents trying to evacuate. Improving culverts would both mitigate flood risks and help aquatic wildlife travel from stream to stream, Daughtry wrote in testimony.

— L.D. 25: An Act to Authorize a General Fund Bond Issue to Fund Wastewater Treatment Facility Planning and Construction of Infrastructure Projects

Another $50 million bond measure from Sen. Stacy Brenner (D-Scarborough) is for municipal and quasi-municipal wastewater treatment plants to purchase equipment that would help reduce the amount of wastewater sludge or biosolids they produce.

This is the scum that gets filtered out during wastewater treatment and often contains forever chemicals called per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances. Maine municipalities often truck that waste to landfills such as Juniper Ridge in Old Town for burial and disposal.

“This will save landfill space, reduce the volume and weight of sludge when it is transported … and will make sludge easier to handle,” wrote Melanie Loyzim, commissioner of the Maine Department of Environmental Protection.

— L.D. 1904: An Act to Establish the Municipal Shoreline Protection Legal Fund

This bill from Sen. Senator Tim Nangle (D-Windham) has a smaller price tag — a minimum of $100,000 — and would build on Nangle’s prior legislation to help municipalities hold developers responsible for damage to fragile shoreline habitat.

The fund would help municipalities pay for legal action against violators of shoreline zoning restrictions and would be reimbursed if the municipalities win in court.

Climate priorities

— L.D. 1870: An Act to Establish a Climate Superfund Cost Recovery Program to Impose Penalties on Climate Polluters

This bill from lead sponsor Brenner would charge fossil fuel companies operating during a certain timespan and emitting a certain amount of greenhouse gases for some costs of Maine climate adaptation projects. It prompted more than 100 letters of testimony when it was introduced last May and has been carried over into the second half of the legislative session.

Other Democratic-led states have introduced similar “climate superfund” bills — 11 total, according to Grist — but only New York and Vermont have been successful. They’ve been mired in legal challenges ever since.

Forest products industry relief

— L.D. 1313: An Act to Promote Equity in the Forest Products Industry by Allowing Commercial Wood Haulers to Be Eligible for Certain Sales Tax Exemptions and Refunds

Spearheaded by Sen. Brad Farrin (R-Norridgewock), L.D. 1313 would provide relief for one link in the forest products industry’s broader supply chain: a sales tax refund or exemption on the purchase of logging equipment and vehicles, from semitrucks to the long-armed machines that cut and haul timber. It would result in an estimated loss in tax revenue to the state of $269,000 in fiscal year 2026-2027, with slightly increasing losses in the years after.

“It’s on the special appropriations table, and, honestly, that one has such a painfully small fiscal note, it would be great if we could get that one to move,” Krysta West, executive director of the Maine Forest Products Council, told The Maine Monitor.

Maine’s multi-billion dollar forest products industry has been hit by inflation, falling market prices for certain timber products, tariffs on logging equipment and an overall decline in manufacturing.

L.D. 798 proposes another $50 million bond that would boost the manufacturing side of Maine’s forest products sector. The bill from Rep.

‘Forever chemicals’ and drinking water

— L.D. 1696: Resolve, to Study Maine’s Absolute Dominion and Beneficial Use Laws Relating to Water Rights

Recurring drought over the past five years has prompted concern about the health of Maine’s aquifers and underwater reserves, especially in relation to the impact of large-scale water extractors such as Poland Spring.

Lead sponsor Rep. Lori Gramlich (D-Old Orchard Beach) told attendees of a Maine Conservation Voters meeting last week that she hopes this bill will study how other states are regulating their water and create actionable policy proposals for Maine.

“We need to really have an examination of what our legal framework is for water,” Gramlich said.

A second study proposal from Gramlich directs the Maine Department of Health and Human Services to study the health impacts of synthetic or artificial turf on humans, with specific concern about their use of forever chemicals.

The bill needs $100,000 in funding. Gramlich said she was working with state officials to try to lower that price tag.",https://themainemonitor.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/statehouse-building-closeup.jpg,N,,2026-01-02 10:59:37.256358

Tax credits and financing Helene costs will help mitigate energy bill changes beginning in 2026

GREENVILLE, S.C. – Beginning in January, Duke Energy will implement changes to customer bills that reflect investments made to recover from the historic damage from Hurricane Helene, strengthen the grid against storms and outages, maintain and upgrade its power generating fleet, and serve a growing customer base while supporting economic growth in South Carolina.

Our view: “Duke Energy is committed to meeting the expectations our customers have around reliability, responsiveness and value – striking the right balance that delivers these at the lowest possible cost for customers,” said Tim Pearson, Duke Energy’s South Carolina president. “That means investing in what matters, delivering results efficiently, and remaining transparent about what customers are paying for and why.”

The Public Service Commission of South Carolina (PSCSC) recently approved these updates for customers of Duke Energy Carolinas (DEC) and Duke Energy Progress (DEP), the company’s two utilities in the state.

Recovering from Helene: Securitization – selling low-interest, long-term bonds – is one way Duke Energy can generate savings and keep costs lower for customers while also recovering large and unexpected expenses like those that resulted from Hurricane Helene. The PSCSC recently approved a securitization plan that will save DEC customers more than $140 million on Helene expenses.

Beginning in January, a typical residential DEC customer using 1,000 kilowatt-hours (kWh) of electricity per month will see a new storm charge on bills reflecting a 3.2% increase, or $4.58. This modest increase still delivers 20% savings for customers over the recovery period compared to traditional cost recovery methods.

“We appreciate the legislature providing tools like securitization to address extreme storm costs as we continue to pursue ways to reduce these impacts on customer bills,” Pearson said.

Powering growth, driving reliability: Duke Energy has made investments in the things our customers expect: upgrades to strengthen the grid, improve reliability and storm resilience, and maintain and upgrade our generation fleet. These investments are already in place and delivering benefits to South Carolina, from faster restoration times to improved reliability and operational efficiency.

For example, as part of ongoing grid upgrades, Duke Energy has nearly tripled the number of South Carolina customers served by self-healing technology over the past two years, with more than 70% of customers now benefiting from this innovative automated power restoration tool.

“Meeting the needs of our customers means prioritizing investments that enhance the grid while also minimizing the cost impact for customers,” Pearson said. “For example, Duke Energy’s nuclear units are expected to generate hundreds of millions of dollars of annual tax credits in the coming years – savings that will be passed to our customers beginning in 2026.”

Bottom line: The PSCSC recently approved comprehensive agreements between diverse groups of stakeholders that will apply these tax credits to bills and include shareholder-funded contributions to residential customers, helping to mitigate the impacts of recent infrastructure investments on customer bills over the next two years.

DEP: Beginning Feb. 1, monthly electric bills for typical DEP residential customers using 1,000 kWh per month will increase about $11.20 a month – from $153.82 per month to $165.02.

DEC: Beginning March 1, monthly electric bills for typical DEC residential customers using 1,000 kWh per month will increase about $0.84 a month – from $148.02 per month to $148.86 (this includes the securitization charge previously mentioned).

DEC serves about 680,000 households and businesses primarily in Upstate and north central South Carolina, including Greenville, Anderson and York counties, while DEP serves about 177,000 customers in the Pee Dee region and northeastern South Carolina, including Sumter, Florence and Darlington counties. If approved by regulators in 2026, the proposed combination of the two utilities would save customers in the Carolinas more than $1 billion in future costs.

Helping customers manage costs: “Customers expect us to manage our costs, but they also want options to manage their own energy usage and give them tools to impact their own bills,” Pearson said. “That’s why we’re helping customers lower their energy use – and lower their bills – through programs that make a measurable difference.”

Across the Carolinas, Duke Energy’s aggressive energy efficiency programs deliver annual savings 150% better than the national average. Improving efficiency benefits all customers by reducing costs for the entire system. In South Carolina, the company recently increased the incentives of many of these programs, expanding ways customers can save money.

“The power industry supply chain has retracted because power build-out in the U.S. has been so minimal for so long.","From artificial intelligence-driven efficiency to transmission bottlenecks, power industry insiders share their perspectives on the opportunities and obstacles shaping 2026 and beyond.

The power generation sector enters 2026 at a critical inflection point. Electricity demand is surging—driven by data centers, manufacturing reshoring, and transportation electrification—even as the industry navigates an unprecedented transformation in how power is generated, transmitted, and consumed. Utilities and independent power producers face the dual challenge of maintaining grid reliability while transitioning to cleaner energy sources, all amid regulatory uncertainty and shifting market dynamics.

This year promises to be pivotal for decisions that will shape the industry’s trajectory for decades. From the continued buildout of renewable capacity to the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into grid management, 2026 will test the sector’s ability to balance innovation with pragmatism.

AI Enhances Efficiency

“The grid will become even more AI-enabled in the next year as AI becomes necessary for utilities to be more efficient,” Pradeep Tagare, head of Investments with National Grid Partners, told POWER. “In our recent Utility Innovation Survey, we saw this in real time: utilities are no longer treating AI as ‘nice to have,’ but rather as a strategic tool to manage load growth, enable reliability, and accelerate grid expansion. Due to the pressures that the electrification of heating, transport, and data center expansion place on the grid, AI-driven forecasting, risk mitigation, and infrastructure planning tools will become essential.”

Albert Hofeldt, Chief Product Officer with Power Factors, said optimization has always been a priority for renewable energy operators, but it has taken on a new significance over the past few years. “Returns for renewable energy projects are shrinking, a sign of our current economic context and a signal of maturity for the market. Rising interest rates have increased the cost of capital, while financial support from state and federal governments disappear, pushing costs back onto developers. The renewable energy market is mature enough now to handle these changes, but it increases the pressure to build a bulletproof business model. In many cases, renewable energy companies are realizing that improving production and reducing future costs can actually deliver a greater and safer return over time than a new development,” he told POWER.

“Machine learning and AI have a big role to play in increasing production from existing assets,” Hofeldt added. “AI can predict issues with underperforming assets earlier, making it possible to conduct maintenance with less downtime, ultimately maximizing energy production and revenue. It can also identify the root cause of underperformance, helping operators prioritize issues quickly and plan maintenance so that the highest-impact fixes are done first.”

How Much Power Will AI Demand

While AI is rapidly becoming indispensable for optimizing grid efficiency and predictive maintenance, this very success is fueling a new massive challenge, that is, meeting the unprecedented increase in power demand that is predicted from the data centers that house AI infrastructure.

“For years, the conversation was about gradual electrification,” Sonya Montgomery, CEO of The Desoto Group, told POWER, referring to electric vehicles (EVs) and heat pumps, as examples of the slow but steady shift. “Recently, however, the need to find gigawatts, not megawatts, almost overnight due to AI-computing demands is something the industry must adapt to.”

A report published in December 2024 by the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy projected total data center energy use through 2028. Researchers presented a range of estimates to reflect various scenarios. Their low- and high-end projections were roughly 325 TWh and 580 TWh in 2028, which represented 6.7% to 12.0% of total U.S. electricity consumption forecasted that year. However, since that time, new developments have put in question almost all estimates of future data center energy demand.

“The DeepSeek R1 model release was probably the most pivotal point in 2025,” Ryan Luther, director of Energy Transition Research with Enverus, reflected. “It made the entire market second guess the load growth from data centers.”

Developed by Chinese startup DeepSeek, R1 is a powerful open-source reasoning model known for its high performance in coding and mathematics at a fraction of the cost of its American counterparts. DeepSeek R1’s efficiency breakthrough showed that algorithmic innovation could drastically reduce the energy footprint per AI task, casting doubt on the exponential power-growth curves currently driving data center planning.

“I think we will continue to see moments like that in 2026 that will have major impacts on the outlook for power markets,” Luther continued. “For instance, Meta is clearly losing the AI race and wasting hundreds of billions pursuing it. If they don’t turn it around quickly, they might have to abandon the endeavor. That would cut a fifth of the data center build-out and reset expectations on power demand growth.”

Utility-Scale Solar Surges On

Regardless of what happens with data center demand, solar photovoltaic (PV) technology will remain the powerhouse of the energy transition (Figure 1). Its unprecedented growth will continue to reshape power markets in 2026 and beyond.

“Renewables and storage will continue to do the bulk of the heavy lifting,” said Peter Davidson, CEO and co-founder of Aligned Climate Capital. “Solar, wind, and batteries are the fastest, cheapest, most scalable way to add firm power—and anyone who thinks otherwise is clinging to an outdated narrative.”

The International Energy Agency (IEA) projects in its Renewables 2025 report, which was released in October, that solar will account for about 80% of the total increase in global renewable power capacity over the next five years. It estimates about 3.68 TW of solar capacity will be added by 2030. This is an astounding figure. At least one detailed study suggests fixed-tilt PV systems require on average 2.85 acres per MW and that tracking systems take even more space—4.17 acres/MW. (Tracking systems use mechanisms to follow the sun, which increases energy yield but requires more spacing between rows to avoid shading as panels tilt and rotate.) Assuming 3.5 acres/MW are used on average for all the new solar PV being added in the next five years, nearly 13 million acres of land will be needed. To put that into perspective, that’s like covering the entire country of Slovakia or most of the state of West Virginia completely with solar panels.

“The solar industry’s resilience is real, but it’s not guaranteed,” Jorge Vargas, CEO of Aspen Power, told POWER. “The biggest potential disruptor would be supply chain friction, especially if trade policies shift in the coming years. Another leading indicator is the health of the tax equity market. If there’s any contraction in available tax credit capital, that would slow growth more than any technical factor.”

Residential Solar Has Gone Mainstream

Driving the decentralized energy movement, U.S. residential solar installations are now measured in the millions, with the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) reporting well over 5 million total installations across the country. However, recent economic headwinds and policy transitions have led to a notable contraction in the rate of new residential installations through the first half of 2025. Still, SEIA’s base case forecast projects that the residential solar market will grow by 3% annually on average from 2025 to 2030.

SolarTech, a leading solar company with offices in California and Arizona, released its own study on the state of solar in December, which was created based on a survey of 2,000 homeowners. “What we’re seeing in the 2025 State of Solar report is a decisive shift in homeowner mindset,” Sonny Gonzalez, director of Marketing at SolarTech, told POWER. “Solar is no longer viewed as an experimental or early adopter investment—it’s becoming a standard part of long-term home planning. With roughly 70% of homeowners either already using solar or expecting to adopt it within the next five years, the market has clearly moved into the mainstream. This level of interest reflects not just improved technology and affordability, but a growing desire among homeowners to take control of their energy future.”

“Right now, the biggest driver is still the fundamental economics,” said Vargas. “Solar is cost-effective, scalable, and increasingly flexible across customer segments. Utility rates are expected to rise sharply over the next several years, which makes solar an even more compelling hedge against those escalating costs. The Inflation Reduction Act [IRA] provided a significant tailwind for project development, but as those incentives begin to phase out, developers and customers will have to rely more heavily on intrinsic project economics and risk management. Going forward, development will increasingly be driven by cost savings, energy resilience, and load-side management. The projects that get built will be those that help customers control costs and mitigate exposure to rising utility prices, even in a world without IRA-backed subsidies.”

“While utility savings remain the single strongest motivator for going solar, the data shows that homeowners are thinking far beyond monthly bills,” said Gonzalez. “Rising concerns about grid reliability, unpredictable outages, and increasing electricity rates are reshaping how people evaluate their energy options. Solar is now seen as a pathway to stability and independence. For many homeowners, adopting solar is as much about resilience and control as it is about reducing costs—and that marks a major evolution in the residential solar mindset.”

FEOC Rules Take Hold

The Foreign Entity of Concern (FEOC) requirements are a set of restrictions established by Congress across several laws, beginning with the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and the IRA, and later expanded by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA, Figure 2). They are designed to prevent entities with strong ties to adversarial nations from benefiting from U.S. clean energy tax credits and to reduce U.S. reliance on these nations—specifically China, Russia, North Korea, and Iran, which are defined in statute as “covered nations”—for critical components in the clean energy supply chain, such as solar panels and electric vehicle (EV) batteries.

FEOC and related “prohibited foreign entity” restrictions represent a significant shift in how clean energy projects qualify for federal tax incentives. Building on IRA and modified by OBBBA, these rules can deny technology‑neutral tax credits—including the Section 48E Investment Tax Credit, Section 45Y Production Tax Credit, and Section 45X Manufacturing Tax Credit—to power plants, energy storage projects, and U.S.‑made products that have too much ownership, control, or critical content traceable to entities linked to covered nations. Compliance analyses focus on several dimensions, including whether the taxpayer is a specified foreign or foreign‑influenced entity, the share of project or product costs attributable to covered‑nation equipment and materials, and whether contractual or financing arrangements give a prohibited foreign entity effective control or “material assistance” in the project.

“We may hear a lot more about FEOC in 2026,” Jim Nutter, managing director with Stout, told POWER. “Developers have tried their best to prepare, but the new part of the law and its interpretation might be hard to navigate in practice.”

Luther suggested uncertainty around the requirements remains. “For 2026, everyone is looking at FEOC to see where the rules end up,” he said.

The stakes are high. For certain technology‑neutral investment tax credits, projects can face full or substantial recapture if, within 10 years of being placed in service, the taxpayer makes payments that give specified prohibited foreign entities effective control or otherwise trigger the new ownership and “applicable payment” restrictions, depending on how the U.S. Department of Treasury ultimately interprets those rules. As the industry awaits clearer Treasury guidance, many developers are working to start construction before key effective dates to take advantage of grandfathering provisions, while also navigating tariff exposure and trying to secure FEOC‑compliant supply chains in a constrained and rapidly evolving market.

Supply Chain Issues Persist, but Some Improvement Seen

Supply chain disruptions have plagued the power industry since at least 2020 when the pandemic upset the normal flow of products, creating cascading delays in everything from transformers to turbines to solar modules. For years, developers have grappled with extended lead times, price volatility, and equipment shortages that stretched project timelines and squeezed margins.

Brandy Johnson, Chief Technology Officer with Babcock & Wilcox (B&W), suggested the problem was lingering long before the pandemic. “The power industry supply chain has retracted because power build-out in the U.S. has been so minimal for so long. But now, especially due to growing demand from AI and data centers, we have a projected build-out in the U.S. energy sector for more generation capacity in a shorter period of time than we’ve potentially seen in our lifetimes,” she told POWER.

“But the lack of manufacturing capacity means supply chains are really showing weakness in their ability to meet the industry’s needs,” Johnson said. “We’re seeing very long lead times on gas turbines, for example, because demand is greatly outpacing the rate at which they can be manufactured. The capacity to build pressure parts for boilers in the U.S. also is diminished, which means suppliers have to look overseas. It’s not just one thing. It’s all of the pieces of the supply chain that are affected.”

Still, it’s not all doom and gloom—the pressure is lessening in some areas. “We’re seeing some easing in the supply chain for basic construction materials, such as steel, which was a major bottleneck during the pandemic,” said Montgomery. “However, more complex materials are still facing delays, particularly those related to transmission line components and high-voltage equipment. High-voltage direct-current cables are an example of procurement that can take up to 24 months to source. The North American Electric Reliability Corp. states that the lead time, the wait between placing an order and the product being delivered, has reached around two years, with large power transformers [Figure 3] taking up to four years.”

“We will begin to see supply chain … challenges easing for sectors tied to electrification or distribution level, but continue to see long lead times for power transformers,” said Charles Murray, CEO and co-founder of Switched Source. “New investments in domestic transformer manufacturing at the distribution level are starting to have an impact, but do not expect prices to come back down for transformers or cables.”

“There have been major investments in domestic manufacturing of grid-critical equipment,” Tagare said. “In fact, National Grid is investing £35 billion over the next six years to help strengthen and unlock long-term supply chain capacity and skills across England and Wales.”

Luther suggested developers need to consider all of their options when sourcing components, not simply focus on one possibility while belaboring its lack of availability. “Everyone is talking about the backlog on utility-scale gas turbines, but there’s over 25 GW in annual global production of sub-100-MW generators that could be used,” he noted. “It’s a significant amount of smaller-scale generation that no one is talking about.”

Johnson also suggested developers should think about alternatives when an originally contemplated form of generation is unavailable. “Especially with data centers, B&W is trying to offer alternatives to build new power generation capacity when supply chain issues limit developers’ options,” she said. “For example, if a developer can’t get gas turbines for a combined cycle plant, we have alternatives that can help them get their plant online much sooner. Alternative technologies are coming to light because they may have supply chains that are more readily accessible.”

Another way companies can find a workaround for supply chain issues is through standardization. “One of the things B&W is doing to address this is more standardization in our boiler and plant designs,” Johnson said. “We’re telling customers that we can speed up the design and construction of a plant if we do less customization. With power producers wanting to bring projects online quickly, speed through standardization is critical.”

The T&D Dilemma

Even as supply chain constraints are overcome, or accounted for, a more fundamental bottleneck threatens to limit how quickly new generation can actually reach customers: the transmission and distribution (T&D) infrastructure itself. Interconnection queues have swelled to historic levels, with gigawatts of ready-to-build projects waiting years for grid connection studies and upgrades. While new solar farms and battery storage facilities can be constructed in months, the transmission lines needed to deliver their power often require a decade or more of planning, permitting, and construction. This growing mismatch between generation development timelines and grid infrastructure timelines has pushed T&D constraints to the forefront of industry challenges (Figure 4) for 2026 and beyond.

“Much of the focus on electricity growth is on new power generation, but power transmission and distribution constraints don’t seem to get as much attention in public discourse,” David Carter, industrials senior analyst at RSM US, told POWER. “Further, just like in generation, these transmission and distribution constraints need an ‘all-of-the-above’ approach. That includes not just new power lines, but expanding the capacity of existing ones by ‘reconductoring’ them with more modern cables and using technology solutions to make better use of what is already in place. In a time where permitting is such a challenge, having options to increase capacity without a years-long process to obtain new rights of way will be key.”

“Queue reform and transmission buildout are make-or-break for the [solar] industry’s ability to scale sustainably,” said Vargas.

Mark Feasel, vice president of Sales with Mission Critical Group, suggested limitations in power delivery could force developers to find other options. “Grid constraints will push organizations toward rapid adoption of distributed generation and on-site power strategies that bring energy closer to the load this year,” he said. “As data centers consume increasing portions of available capacity, hospitals, manufacturers, and other critical infrastructure operators will be forced to rethink how they secure not just reliable power, but resilient power, when the utility can no longer meet their needs.”

Luther suggested self-generation is already a growing trend. “A lot of hyperscalers are looking to bring their own generation and go behind the meter to avoid the long lead times of getting grid connected, which means the load might not materialize on the grid but off of it,” he said. “At the same time PJM, MISO [Midcontinent Independent System Operator], and SPP [Southwest Power Pool] are all accelerating queue timelines for dispatchable assets. So, if both of these trends emerge, its very likely these markets end up being better supplied than they are today.”

Meanwhile, leaders in Washington could also play a role this year. “The administration and Congress both seem to recognize the importance of permitting reform, and a streamlined process that reduces uncertainty would help power projects come online faster, with better project economics,” Carter noted.

Closing Thoughts

All of the leaders POWER spoke to expressed genuine optimism about the year ahead. Their confidence stems not from abstract hope but from tangible opportunities they see emerging in many areas. Yet, aside from the big talking points—AI, data centers, solar power’s future, supply chains, and infrastructure—three interesting items emerged.

“There is a growing importance of collaboration across the utility-startup ecosystem. Too many promising technologies stall in the ‘pilot doom loop’ because utility leaders and innovators lack the shared frameworks, data access, and operational pathways needed to move from experimentation to real system impact,” Tagare said. “The most successful solutions emerge when utility leaders and startups collaborate on deployment models early—aligning on integration requirements, regulatory considerations, and measurable value from day one.”

“With the increasing electrification of things such as transport, heating, and cooking, it’s important to recognize and plan for a shift in peak power from a summer afternoon to a winter evening as the heat gets going, dinner is cooking, and EVs are charging,” said Carter. “One leader for a distribution utility recently highlighted the importance of how ‘EVs come in gangs’ to neighborhoods as neighbors influence other neighbors on EV adoption, it can quickly overload local transformer capacity during peak periods without proper planning or load-shifting capabilities.”

“Most people understand that storage is important for solar, but the reality is that it still does not always make financial sense. Making storage work requires careful project design, timing, and alignment with grid needs. That is why we are so focused on it. Projects that get storage right will capture real value, while others risk underperforming,” Vargas said. “Another misconception is that solar growth will stall once IRA incentives fade. Projects with strong underlying economics will continue moving forward, and developers who integrate storage effectively will lead the market.”

The common thread running through these perspectives is clear: success in 2026’s power sector will belong to those who move beyond siloed thinking, whether that means utilities partnering earlier with innovators, grid planners anticipating neighborhood-level adoption patterns, or developers designing projects around actual grid value rather than subsidy availability.

Yet, despite these political moves, coal’s trajectory in the U.S. energy market has followed a different path, shaped more by economic realities than government intervention. Market forces, particularly the rise of cheaper and cleaner energy sources, continue to undermine coal development.

Coal once formed the backbone of American electricity production, with its usage steadily rising. However, since peaking in the early 2000s, coal-fired power has sharply declined. In 1950, coal was the dominant source of electricity across the grid, but by 2023, it accounted for only 9% of the nation’s total energy consumption.

A recent manifestation of the malaise is that the federal government rejected the recent “low-ball” bid from the sole bidder (Navajo Transitional Energy Co.) to acquire 167 million tons of coal on federal public lands in Montana. The company bid $186,000 (less than a penny per ton). The failed lease sale would have been the biggest federal government coal sale in more than a decade.

The failed Montana coal lease sale vividly demonstrates the lack of interest for coal among utilities generating electricity throughout the country. They are turning to cheaper natural gas and renewables. In spite of the administration’s interest in reviving the coal industry, economists say federal attempts to boost coal are not going to reverse its years-long decline.

Actions During President Trump’s First Term (2017–2021)

In its first term, the Trump administration tried to reverse the coal policies of the Obama administration through various actions, including:

Ending the Federal Coal Leasing Moratorium. A 2016 moratorium, which temporarily halted new coal leases on federal lands to allow for an environmental review, was lifted in March 2017. This Trump administration change reinstated the ability for companies to acquire new leases.

Rescinding New Valuation Rules. The U.S. Department of the Interior (DOI) repealed new rules that calculated royalties for coal extracted from federal land based on the sales price, rather than a lower figure. This move effectively reduced the cost for mining companies to extract coal.

Actions During Trump’s Second Term (2025–present)

President Trump’s second administration has continued and expanded the pro-coal policies of his first term. In April 2025, Trump signed a series of executive orders to boost the coal industry. These orders declare that “coal is essential to our national and economic security” and direct federal agencies to take several actions, such as:

Prioritize Coal Leasing. Agencies must identify coal resources on federal lands, lift barriers to mining, and prioritize coal leasing.

Rescind Anti-Coal Policies. Agencies must overturn policies aimed at transitioning the country away from coal.

Promote “Clean” Coal Technology. Agencies must allocate $625 million toward recommissioning or modernizing aging coal plants.

Expand Federal Land for Mining. Agencies must open more than 20,000 square miles of federal land to mining.

Executive Orders

The recent executive orders and proclamations also include directions to various agencies to:

Promote coal for new technologies such as using coal to power new artificial intelligence (AI) data centers.

Investigate and challenge state-level laws that restrict the use of coal and other fossil fuels.

Sharply reduce royalty rates for coal extracted from federal lands.

Extend, by two years, the date by which coal-fired power plants were to comply with the Environmental Protection Agency’s National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants.

The same week that the U.S. Department of Energy allocated $625 million in funding for retrofitting and recommissioning aging coal plants to extend their lifespans, the DOI issued a press release stating that it would open 13.1 million acres of federal land to coal mining and streamline approvals for projects in Montana, Wyoming, and Tennessee.

Economics and the Markets Ultimately Drive Coal (or Any Energy) Development

Federal policies have not been able to reverse the decline in the demand for coal, even when those policies are favorable to the industry. Political attempts to support coal have not, for example, increased employment or production significantly. Some argue that regulations have been a factor, but market forces are the primary driver. Regulations can affect decisions, but market competitiveness remains the larger issue.

Ultimately, market fundamentals are the main drivers of coal development. While federal, state, and local policies can influence the market, they cannot override economic realities that demonstrate that the cost of coal development is rising, and other energy sources are more competitive. Simply put, the cost of coal is increasing, and coal plants have become more expensive to operate. Those realities contrast dramatically with the fact that newer energy alternatives will continue to drive down interest in the use of coal.",https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/coal-free-image-from-rawpixel.png,N,,2026-01-02 09:13:05.905497

It's cold and snowy in much of the U.S. right now, but hard as it may be to believe in some parts of the country, heat season will eventually come again, and hotter summers are increasingly a risk for American workers. This year, the federal government is considering new rules to protect employees from excessive heat. A new study looks at what matters most for keeping workers safe. NPR's Alejandra Borunda reports.

ALEJANDRA BORUNDA, BYLINE: People have known forever that hot weather can be dangerous for workers. Even ancient Egyptians worried about dehydration for people building the pyramids. And the problem is just as critical for people working outside now. And it's not just heatstroke that's a risk.

ADAM DEAN: Heat makes people slower to react and worse at making decisions.

BORUNDA: Adam Dean is a political scientist who researches labor conditions at George Washington University.

DEAN: And that means that farm workers driving a tractor or a construction worker operating equipment is more likely to have a fatal accident on a hot day.

BORUNDA: Dean is the lead author of a new analysis in the journal Health Affairs. It looked at workplace deaths related to heat in California, which was the first state to pass protections for people who work outdoors. The researchers compared deaths in California with states nearby that didn't have those rules. The study found California's rules likely saved dozens of lives every year, even as climate change has made those heat risks more intense. But Dean says fine-tuning the rule took some trial and error.

DEAN: When California first adopted a heat standard in 2005, it was ineffective.

BORUNDA: Dean says the original guidelines weren't specific enough. They said employers, like farmers, for example, had to offer their workers water, shade and rest when it's hot. But when inspectors showed up, they sometimes found problems, like undrinkable water. So the state clarified. Water had to be drinkable and free, not just there, and there needed to be enough shade for all workers during breaks. The state also ramped up their inspections and launched an intensive campaign to educate workers about their rights. Dean says all those changes made a real difference.

DEAN: I think a critical lesson is that merely passing a heat standard is not enough. And it was only after the state launched a statewide enforcement campaign that we started to see deaths decrease relative to surrounding states.

BORUNDA: The new study was published as the federal government is currently considering new heat rules that would apply nationally. Worker advocates want it to mimic California's more specific rules, while many employer groups prefer a more flexible standard. The new study joins several other analyses published this year that found standards, especially strict ones, can protect workers. Barrak Alahmad is an occupational health researcher at Harvard University. He says all the studies use different datasets and methods.

BARRAK ALAHMAD: And in science, you like to see that. You like to see this consistency and these additional layers of evidence.

BORUNDA: The future of the federal heat rules is uncertain. They were first proposed under President Biden's administration, and the Trump administration is now reviewing them. In the meantime, several states and cities have adopted their own rules in recent years, and others, like New Mexico and Arizona, are currently considering them.

Environmental groups are yet again challenging Louisiana regulators in their decision to reissue a previously suspended permit for a liquified natural gas export facility in Cameron Parish.

The Sierra Club, Turtle Island Restoration Network and Louisiana Bucket Brigade filed a lawsuit in Louisiana’s 38th Judicial District against the Louisiana Department of Conservation and Energy.

The environmental groups say that the agency “violated its constitutional, statutory and regulatory duties,” as well as the court’s previous judgment when it reissued a permit for the construction of Commonwealth LNG’s export facility on the coast of Cameron Parish.

​​“We are objecting to this permit because it was hastily reissued and did not give the judge’s valid concerns the genuine scrutiny they deserved,” said Anne Rolfes, director of the Louisiana Bucket Brigade.

“The communities who would be impacted by Commonwealth LNG have made it very clear that this project is not needed and not wanted,” said Eric Huber, Sierra Club managing attorney.

Huber said the Department of Conservation and Energy “is attempting to shrug off its responsibility” by relying on studies done by other agencies— the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality and Federal Energy Regulatory Commission— rather than doing its own analysis.

The lawsuit is the latest in back-and-forth between regulators, environmentalists and industry as the liquified natural gas industry pursues its expansion along the Gulf Coast.

Louisiana district judge Penelope Richard ruled in a surprise move in October that the state agency did not adequately consider the effects of climate change and impacts to environmental justice communities nearby the planned facility when it issued its first permit to Commonwealth LNG.

About a month later, the state reissued the permit, citing the need for haste in part to align with the Trump administration’s “energy dominance” agenda.

For eeNews Europe readers, the development is relevant as it provides insight into how large OEMs are structuring in-house battery manufacturing, and what this could mean for future sourcing, cell formats and production technologies across the European automotive supply chain.

Salzgitter gigafactory moves from build-out to production

The Salzgitter facility is the first PowerCo gigafactory to enter operation and is positioned as the lead plant for subsequent sites planned in Valencia, Spain, and St. Thomas, Canada. According to Volkswagen Group, the factory has begun producing prismatic Unified Cells “made in Europe”, with initial volumes destined for final road tests before series deployment.

The cells are expected to debut next year in the Electric Urban Car Family from Volkswagen, ŠKODA and SEAT/CUPRA. Within the group’s wider battery sourcing strategy, PowerCo is projected to cover around half of Unified Cell demand, with the remainder supplied externally. This hybrid approach could potentially reduce dependency on Asian suppliers while retaining flexibility in chemistry and sourcing.

Unified Cell strategy and technology scope

The Unified Cell concept is designed as a standardised architecture that can accommodate multiple chemistries, including nickel-manganese-cobalt (NMC), lithium iron phosphate (LFP) and, longer term, solid-state variants. The first Salzgitter-produced cell is based on NMC chemistry and is described as delivering around 10 percent higher energy density than previous generation cells used by the group.

Volkswagen states that the cell is optimised for its cell-to-pack battery system, which removes intermediate module stages. From an engineering perspective, this integration could translate into efficiency gains at pack level, although real-world performance will depend on vehicle integration and thermal management strategies.

Scaling, sustainability and digitalisation focus

Production capacity at Salzgitter is planned to ramp to around 20 GWh per year in an initial phase, with expansion potential to 40 GWh depending on demand. PowerCo also highlights sustainability measures at the site, including the use of renewable electricity for energy-intensive processes such as drying rooms, which are typically fossil-fuel powered in conventional cell plants.

The factory incorporates a high degree of automation and real-time data monitoring. According to the company, thousands of data points from equipment and building systems feed into digital process control and AI-supported quality monitoring, an approach that could influence how future European gigafactories are designed and operated.",https://ee.cdnartwhere.eu/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Volkswagen-Group-1.png,N,,2026-01-02 07:57:45.187237

“Lithium demand for agriculture is expected to rise by over 30% globally by 2026 due to innovative fertilizer applications.”

Introduction: Lithium’s Expanding Significance in Mining & Agriculture

Lithium, a soft, silvery-white alkali metal, has emerged as one of the most critical minerals of the 21st century due to its unique chemical properties and wide range of modern applications. As technology, mining, and agriculture sectors undergo transformative changes, the growing importance of lithium minerals and lithium miners is being felt across traditional boundaries. With demand soaring for everything from battery manufacturing to sustainable energy and even agricultural productivity, 2025 and 2026 will see the role of lithium transcend its original markets—reshaping industries as diverse as EVs, renewable power, and food security.

This article delves into the expanding relevance, innovations, and sustainable practices surrounding lithium minerals and the miners who bring them to market, with a deep focus on emerging agricultural trends that will define the years ahead.

Lithium Minerals: Overview, Chemistry & Key Deposits

Lithium minerals are a group of compounds and rocks containing significant quantities of lithium, and they have become integral to a range of industries beyond their traditional boundaries. The most common lithium-rich minerals found are:

🔬 Spodumene – The primary hard-rock lithium mineral, with high lithium density.

🧪 Petalite – Sought after for its stability in lithium extraction processes.

🟣 Lepidolite – A mica mineral type, valuable for its lithium and rare earth element content.

🌊 Brine Deposits – Large, underground lithium reservoirs are found beneath salt flats (salars), such as in Chile, Argentina, and Bolivia.

Lithium is highly reactive due to its alkali metal properties, allowing it to form valuable compounds for energy storage, electrochemical applications, and now—emerging agricultural science.

Luckily for us the time to Save Howard Knob is now.” The conservancy grew out of the first push to “Save The Knob” in 1993.
In 1993, Floridian Monte Green bought an adjacent 74 acres of Howard Knob that contained a large boulder field and some of the best views from the mountain.
The boulders are so unusual and so attractive to climbers the site has been written about in Climbing magazine.
To see the community that Blue Ridge Conservancy has created around protecting our landscape is truly heartwarming.","The Blue Ridge Conservancy has sealed a deal to purchase Howard Knob after trying for 30 years to make sure the site overlooking Boone and coveted by rock climbers would never be developed.

Known to locals mostly as Howard’s Knob, the site is the summit of a mountain named for Benjamin Howard, a British loyalist said to have hidden in a cave near the knob during the Revolutionary War.

The knob is covered in boulders of gneiss, a hard stone that makes for technically challenging routes and doesn’t crumble as climbers traverse its face.

The conservancy says it’s raising money for trails and amenities and hopes to open the 74-acre property to the public sometime in 2026.

“Blue Ridge Conservancy is excited to reopen this historic climbing area and create additional hiking trails on the mountain, including the future location of the Northern Peaks State Trail,” Eric Hiegl, BRC’s senior director of land protection and conservation planning, said in an announcement about the purchase on the group’s website. “Land conservation projects have their own time schedule and happen when the time is right. Luckily for us the time to Save Howard Knob is now.”

The conservancy grew out of the first push to “Save The Knob” in 1993.

Area residents and students attending Appalachian State University knew the site from the late 1970s, when President Jimmy Carter’s Department of Energy selected it for the placement of an experimental wind turbine. It was celebrated at the time as the world’s largest windmill, with blades 97 feet long. The huge turbine was supposed to generate enough electricity to power hundreds of homes, but mostly it generated complaints from people who said it rattled the windows in their homes and interfered with their television reception.

The turbine was dismantled in 1983 and the 5-acre site where it sat became a Watauga County park.

In 1993, Floridian Monte Green bought an adjacent 74 acres of Howard Knob that contained a large boulder field and some of the best views from the mountain. Protesters gathered to try to protect the site, and the only home built there was Green’s, though he banned climbers from the property.

The boulders are so unusual and so attractive to climbers the site has been written about in Climbing magazine.

“The Howard Knob project was the catalyst that started the land conservation movement in the High Country,” conservationist and former High Country Conservancy Executive Director Michelle Merritt Leonard said in the announcement. “The energy around that project was hopeful and electric, attracting people to get on board! To see the community that Blue Ridge Conservancy has created around protecting our landscape is truly heartwarming. In the blink of an eye, it’s 30 years later, and we’re all coming together to see the project through. That’s something special.”

The Energy Department doesn’t get involved in those decisions ordinarily.
And it’s true of the Trump administration’s market interference in Indiana and Michigan.","The Trump administration is badly stretching the law to keep open coal-fired power plants throughout the Midwest that otherwise would have shuttered under well-thought-out, long-term strategies.

The latest examples are in neighboring Indiana, where the Department of Energy late last month ordered utilities not to close two aging power stations that otherwise would have been taken out of service by the end of last month. The orders mean that the Schahfer station in Wheatfield, Indiana, and the F.B. Culley station in Warrick County, Indiana, will remain open for 90 days.

If DOE’s previous actions in Michigan are a guide, where DOE saved a coal-fired plant about 35 miles east of Grand Rapids from closure beginning in May, those Indiana plants will likely get another 90-day reprieve after the current one expires and likely more such orders once the next 90 days pass by.

President Donald Trump long has supported the continued burning of coal to produce electricity despite risks to human health as well the emissions’ well-established contributions to Earth’s warming climate. At the same time, Trump recently acted to kill five large-scale wind farms already under construction in the Atlantic that are slated to generate enough power to serve 2.5 million household and business customers. Trump seems to detest wind power as much as he professes to love coal power.

In the case of the Michigan and Indiana coal plants, the Energy Department is ordering them kept alive under provisions of the Federal Power Act that are meant for reliability crises, such as those caused by natural disasters.

The Schahfer plant, located about 75 miles southeast of Chicago, was slated for closure years ago under a comprehensive plan put together by Northern Indiana Public Service Co. (NIPSCO), which serves much of the northern third of the state. While there are legitimate concerns throughout the Midwest about future reliability due to new data centers and their substantial power consumption, there is no looming emergency that justifies the administration’s action here.

Regional power-grid managers, in concert with utilities, have the ability to order plants on the chopping block to continue running if there are threats to reliability, and they use that authority from time to time. The Energy Department doesn’t get involved in those decisions ordinarily.

That’s how such decisions should continue to be made.

Heavy-handed government involvement in energy markets is not unique to Washington. We’ve seen governments at the state level, including in Illinois, get overly involved in determining the proper mix of power generation — usually to the detriment of ratepayers. Trump’s thumb on the scale to favor coal burners will have the same effect. After all, these plants were closing in part because they’re more expensive than other available energy sources. Ratepayers will shoulder that cost at a time when inflation and affordability are top public concerns.

Slowly but surely, the U.S. is moving in the direction of clean energy. With some exceptions, the market is doing a pretty good job of making that transition as cost effectively as possible. Government has a role to play — as a setter of environmental standards, for example — but shouldn’t be picking winners and losers.

That’s true in Illinois, where we’ve seen heavy-handed moves from those opposed to fossil fuels founder on realities of supply and demand. And it’s true of the Trump administration’s market interference in Indiana and Michigan.",https://www.chicagotribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ctc-177045235-e1767209514599.jpg?w=1024&h=761,N,,2026-01-02 07:13:22.125819

NEW NORTH CAROLINA LAW STRICTLY DEFINING SEXES AS MALE OR FEMALE GOES INTO EFFECT

House Bill 805 was passed after a legislative override of the governor’s veto. The bill began life as a bipartisan effort to protect women and children from online sexual predators. After passing the state House, the bill was re-shaped in the Senate into what became an effort to codify gender identity into North Carolina law. The new law, which recognizes only two genders on all official state documentation, requires individuals to be identified by their gender at birth and not by their chosen gender identity or presentation. The change would most notably affect identification, such as driver’s licenses. While state senator Kevin Corbin (R) calls it “fair for everyone,” state senator Julie Mayfield (D) calls it “another example of importing to North Carolina this national anti-LGBTQ agenda.”

Senate Bill 248 takes a significant step in reducing the differences in birth certificates for those who are adopted. The new law allows for adoptive parents to be named on a child’s birth certificate, while making it easier for counties to issue certified birth certificates to adopted individuals.

Senate Bill 690 covers a range of business/broker-related issues. Most notably, its provision changes what is allowed on a real estate purchase offer. The change allows compensation paid (or commission to be paid) to a buyer’s agent to be included in the offer.

Most of the nearly 100 bluebelts in New York City are located on Staten Island.
In Staten Island, the city started building them decades ago, when space was less of an issue.
For Staten Island, bluebelts offered a solution—not just for residents, but also for the local critters.
The city has recently announced a plan to help, which included the construction of storm sewers, raising some streets and building bluebelts.","New York City is expected to experience increasing rainfall over the next few decades, especially during cloudbursts—short, intense rainfall events.

When rain falls, light showers can usually be handled by the complex network of sewer pipes that run beneath the city. But during heavy downpours, water can accumulate, posing a danger to the residents and their homes, especially if they live in basement apartments.

Around 30 years ago, on Staten Island, the city tried something new to address flooding—bluebelts. Often connected to a network of storm sewers, these drainage systems—usually wetlands and ponds—slow floodwaters, act as barriers during storms and sequester pollutants, directly reducing flood risk and helping protect homes by controlling water flow.

Most of the nearly 100 bluebelts in New York City are located on Staten Island. The city plans to build more bluebelts, but space constraints in other boroughs have slowed progress. But earlier this month, Mayor Adams announced that the city will invest $68 million to build a bluebelt in Brooklyn’s Prospect Park—the borough’s first.

In Staten Island, the city started building them decades ago, when space was less of an issue. In the late 1990s, development on the island, especially on the South Shore, accelerated. Sewer systems did not extend across the entire island, and many homes still used septic tanks.

Staten Island needed sanitary sewers—a network of pipes connecting people’s homes to a sewage treatment plant—and storm sewers, which handle rainfall runoff. In about 60 percent of the city, stormwater and sewage run through the same pipes to wastewater treatment plants.

When the sewer system is overwhelmed during extreme rainfall events, both sewage and stormwater are discharged into the Hudson River and its estuaries through combined sewer overflows.

“We wanted to figure out how to work with water and not against it,” said Sangamithra Iyer, the chief of bluebelts and urban stormwater planning at the city Department of Environmental Protection.

Rob Brauman, deputy chief of bluebelt operations and maintenance at the city Department of Environmental Protection, and David Peterson, the deputy director of Staten Island construction at the city Department of Design and Construction, began working on bluebelts in the 1990s.

“Everything you see here was created,” said Brauman, as he looked at a portion of the New Creek bluebelt in Staten Island on an overcast morning. Ducks move leisurely along the stream in the middle of the constructed wetland, unbothered by the rain.

Before it became a bluebelt, the entire area was covered in phragmites—an invasive tall grass—and construction debris, Brauman said. Now, it’s full of native plants and wildlife. And when it rains, all that water flows to the wetland and eventually into the harbor, not into people’s homes.

For Staten Island, bluebelts offered a solution—not just for residents, but also for the local critters. Ducks can often be seen floating across these wetlands, and American eels have been observed in bluebelts in the southwest of the island.

In many Staten Island bluebelts, when it rains, water flows across streets and sidewalks and into storm grates, through storm sewer pipes and then conveys the water to a nearby wetland, or bluebelt.

The water discharges into a pool where sediment and other substances can sink to the bottom before it flows into the wetland. Another pool is located where the water re-enters the storm sewer system. Once the water enters the wetland, native plants help filter pollutants, including lawn fertilizer.

The water eventually re-enters the storm sewer network after passing through a trash grate, which captures much of the remaining debris. When the water is released into the Hudson River or the ocean, it’s cleaner.

The flow of water across the bluebelt also slows it down—most are designed to release water slowly over time, especially during a storm—preventing the sewers from overflowing and flooding the streets. They can also be adjusted depending on the severity of the storm.

In other cases, bluebelts can also enhance already existing ponds and streams to hold more water during storms.

According to Peterson, the cost of bluebelts—which can exceed $100 million—is worth it because it helps residents avoid costly insurance claims and flood damage repairs.

Initially, bluebelts were developed without climate change in mind, said Brauman. But now amid rising flood risks, they can accommodate the flow of water from more severe storms.

In 2012, a massive storm surge from Hurricane Sandy hit the East and South shores of Staten Island hard. According to the city, around 16 percent of the island’s residents were affected because they lived in the areas where the Federal Emergency Management Agency found that floodwaters had broken through.

The construction process can take years—future bluebelts often sit in areas with contaminated soil and construction debris. The soil must be removed and replaced to rebuild a healthy wetland, Peterson said.

According to materials provided by the Department of Environmental Protection, the city removed over 100,000 cubic yards of debris and tamed 12 acres of invasive weeds to build New Creek in Staten Island.

New Creek also had an active stream running through it, forcing Peterson and his team to divert the channel while they restored the soil beneath it.

In recent years, the city has sought to build bluebelts in flood-prone areas of Queens, but has encountered obstacles.

Many areas of Queens have combined sewer systems, making it difficult to separate stormwater from sewage. According to Rohit Aggarwala, the commissioner of the New York City Department of Environmental Protection, this often means that the city must build new storm sewers to direct water to the bluebelt, which can be costly.

“We want to hold [water] and release it slowly so we prevent flooding downstream,” said Brauman, “and we want to give the plants time to clean the water.”

The city’s sewers were not designed for the amount of water that now falls on the city during intense storms. As Inside Climate News previously reported, some of the city’s plans, like sewer infrastructure projects, have been delayed.

According to Aggarwala, bluebelts and green infrastructure, which include natural solutions such as rain gardens, storm sewers and detention tanks that hold water during rainstorms, should be considered joint solutions to flooding across the city.

Sometimes, Aggarwala said, there is no entirely natural way to combat flooding in an area, and infrastructure is needed. For example, in a Brooklyn neighborhood affected by chronic flooding, his department plans to expand the sewer system’s capacity by upgrading the infrastructure because there is no space for bluebelts.

But sometimes, a multi-pronged approach is possible. In a neighborhood nicknamed the Hole which straddles the borders of Brooklyn and Queens, streets and homes sit multiple feet below the surrounding area, leading to chronic flooding. The city has recently announced a plan to help, which included the construction of storm sewers, raising some streets and building bluebelts.

“We’ve also been looking at a mix—bringing all sorts of green and gray infrastructure solutions to the single problem of flooding in a neighborhood,” said Aggarwala.",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_1178-1024x682.jpg,N,,2026-01-02 05:57:46.827868

Efforts to bolster grid resilience and invest in critical infrastructure underscored that dependable, affordable domestic energy, rooted in oil and gas, is the bedrock of family stability and economic growth.
Third, domestic energy funds true conservation.
Fifth, the Gulf of America is a leader in low-carbon intensity production, displacing dirtier foreign alternatives while lowering worldwide emissions.","Last year reminded America of a timeless truth our grandparents understood: When you empower the people who fuel your nation, prosperity follows.

In 2025, energy policy shifted from a defensive position to bold offense under new leadership. The results reverberated across America at the gas pump.

We are thankful for the contributions of the Gulf of America builders, fabricators, boat captains, engineers and offshore crews that helped to make these results possible, all in an energy basin that is one of our planet’s most productive and environmentally responsible producing provinces.

When policymakers treat domestic oil and gas as a strategic asset rather than a liability, communities thrive, jobs multiply and families breathe easier.

I drew six lessons from 2025:

First, reliability is a core value, not mere rhetoric. Americans judge policy by outcomes: lights that stay on and bills that don't break the bank. Efforts to bolster grid resilience and invest in critical infrastructure underscored that dependable, affordable domestic energy, rooted in oil and gas, is the bedrock of family stability and economic growth.

Second, an ""all-of-the-above"" strategy succeeds only when it honors the workers on the ground. Energy workers are America's competitive edge, not a footnote. When policies respect their grit and reduce regulatory burdens, private investment surges, creating high-wage jobs and revitalizing communities.

Third, domestic energy funds true conservation. This isn't a talking point, it's fiscal reality. The Great American Outdoors Act channels up to $1.9 billion annually from federal energy revenues to restore national parks, wildlife refuges and public lands, with much of it sourced from responsible oil and gas production in places like the Gulf of America.

Fourth, emissions reductions stem from innovation, not mandates. The United States has slashed greenhouse gas emissions by approximately 17% below 2005 levels, even as oil and gas output grew, thanks to American ingenuity in cleaner technologies and efficient practices.

Fifth, the Gulf of America is a leader in low-carbon intensity production, displacing dirtier foreign alternatives while lowering worldwide emissions.

Sixth, permitting reform is essential policy. Overregulation, redundant reviews and protracted timelines stifle wells, pipelines and grid expansions.

Moving forward, we need to continue playing offense.

Momentum demands focus and action. To secure 2025's gains, we must aggressively tackle challenges, especially in the Gulf of America. Predictable lease sales, stable timelines and globally competitive fiscal terms to attract investment maintain environmentally advantaged production and sustain the ports, shipyards and service firms that underpin Louisiana's middle class.

We must secure the entire energy chain, from molecules to electrons, by integrating pipelines, refineries, power plants and transmission as unified assets for resilience. Our workforce is a strategic priority: Vocational training, veteran transitions, maritime skills and apprenticeships are vital.

Progress is fragile. Every contractor bidding projects, shipyard hiring crews and offshore worker eyeing schedules knows clarity will quickly evaporate if we return to energy defense. We are reminded that there are no wealthy low energy consuming nations on the planet. In many ways, energy consumption has become a proxy for human prosperity.

Given that America has experienced six recessions from 1973 to 2019, all preceded by spikes in energy prices, it should not be debatable that American energy, including that from the Gulf of America, represents the best opportunity to achieve national energy dominance while curbing global emissions, supercharging the economy with family-sustaining wages and vibrant Main Streets and fortifying security by powering homes, hospitals and defenses without foreign reliance.

Do not fall for the political ploy that the economy will be boosted and jobs created if environmental regulations are weakened or eliminated.","Once again, my New Year’s resolutions pertain directly to our personal health and well-being.

I don’t mean more trips to the gym and fewer to the refrigerator. Instead, I propose keeping our elected officials apprised that protection of natural habitats and native wildlife needs to be on the front burner.

Also, those we have placed in charge have a responsibility to ensure that our shared natural resources of air and water stay clean.

I have heard of proposals here and there at local, state and federal levels of government that would benefit a few at a cost to the many. If carried out, from county to national levels, the effect on the natural environment would be regrettable and would, in turn, adversely affect us all.

As a prime example at the federal level, substantive changes that might be forthcoming in the Environmental Protection Agency are uncertain. But any rumblings that we need to weaken the oversight and rulings by this critical government program should be cause for alarm.

And the idea proposed by some of abolishing the EPA entirely is beyond alarming; it is absurd and would be inherently irresponsible for any member of Congress to support. A worthwhile New Year’s resolution would be to oppose any legislation that even hints at getting rid of a government agency that limits assaults on the environment from unchecked commercial greed.

The outcomes from a weakened EPA would be detrimental to the majority of U.S. citizens.

As I have noted before, specters of what would happen by gutting the authority of the EPA are disquieting. Do we really want to curb EPA regulations that prevent mining wastes from being dumped into clear-flowing mountain streams? Do we want streams that trout and other aquatic wildlife can no longer live in?

I don’t think so. President Richard Nixon had it right when he formed the EPA in 1970 and signed the Clean Water Act in 1972.

Another suggestion has been to reduce EPA air quality regulations. Such regulations limit emissions that result in undesirable outcomes such as acid rain, smog and lung cancer.

Think about it. In the 1960s in Gary, Indiana, and Birmingham, Alabama, you could not see buildings half a mile away because of the smoke and soot filling the air. President Nixon did the right thing when he signed the Clean Air Act in 1970.

Weakening regulatory features of the EPA would definitely not be an improvement. Clean air and clean water are crucial for maintaining the quality of life we have come to expect.

I suggest everyone resolve to keep our country’s natural heritage and a healthy environment as priorities for the coming year. Keep an eye on proposed changes in any program that can affect the environment in your community, your region, your nation.

Resolve to challenge your congressional representatives when you hear of a proposal that would diminish the effectiveness of maintaining standards for potable water and unpolluted air.

Make a resolution to get the facts when politicians start making promises they claim will help everybody. Do not fall for the political ploy that the economy will be boosted and jobs created if environmental regulations are weakened or eliminated.

Look, instead, at who would benefit from the loosening of any given environmental regulation. Someone will be making money. But you can be sure it won’t be you and me. We will be stuck with murky skies, undrinkable water and habitats in which our native wildlife cannot survive.

I have used the EPA as an example, but bad things could be happening environmentally in your community, your county or your state. Resolve to pay attention to what would happen to your air, water and ecosystems if certain regulations are eliminated.

Will a proposed change be in the best public interest or does it financially benefit only a few special interest groups? Make environmental resolutions for yourself and future generations — and have a happy new year.

The memorable quote from Charles Hua of consumer advocacy group PowerLines sums up the current conversation on energy affordability, which defined federal, state, and local policy and politics this year.

Americans are in the midst of a broader cost of living crisis, spurred by the first real bout of inflation in decades. Electricity bills have become a major driver of that worrisome trend, with costs rising at more than twice the rate of inflation over the last year, largely because it’s expensive to maintain, expand, and repair the grid.

Now, President Donald Trump’s policies are making the bad situation worse — despite his frequent promises to bring down costs. On his first day in office, Trump declared an ​“energy emergency,” saying Americans faced an ​“active threat” from high energy prices and that the country needed an ​“affordable and reliable domestic supply of energy” to curb them.

“Reliable” is code for coal and gas in the Trump administration’s book. The U.S. Department of Energy has used the ​“emergency” to keep fossil-fueled power plants open past their retirement dates and to prop up the dying coal industry, at great expense to ratepayers. A Michigan coal plant that was supposed to shutter in May instead racked up $650,000 each day in costs for ratepayers after the DOE ordered it to keep running. That number will only grow as the plant runs through the winter.

Meanwhile, the administration has retaliated against cheaper and quicker ways to get more power online: namely, renewables and battery storage. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which Trump signed in July, scraps tax credits for solar and wind deployment as well as incentives for home energy improvements. The result? Fewer cheap clean energy projects will be built, and by 2035 the average American household will pay $170 more each year for energy than they do now, according to the think tank Energy Innovation.

It’s not just electricity. Natural gas prices are expected to rise this winter as well, and a delay in the distribution of federal home heating assistance, spurred by the government shutdown, will only exacerbate the challenge for families. More cuts to federal programs that help households reduce their energy usage and bills, including Energy Star and the Weatherization Assistance Program, could still be on the way.

The urgency of the energy affordability situation is starting to shape politics at the state and local level, too.

Throughout the year, blue-state lawmakers have invoked affordability both to bash the Trump administration for stymieing renewables — and to excuse their own backtracking from climate goals. That dichotomy has been especially apparent in New York, which in July passed a groundbreaking ban on new gas hookups that was expected to lower families’ energy usage and bills, but then paused its implementation just a few months later. In November, New York also authorized a gas pipeline project it had rejected three times before. Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul has cited affordability concerns for her decisions.

Affordability also factored in on Election Day.

New Jersey’s Democratic Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill campaigned on the promise of building out more clean energy, including offshore wind, to curb rising prices. In Virginia, Democratic Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger and Democratic state legislators ran their successful campaigns on the promise of curbing power prices in the data center capital of the world. And in Georgia, where rates are rising fast, two Democrats who promised a focus on affordability and ​“clean, reliable energy” unseated Republican incumbents on the regulatory commission that oversees ratemaking for the state’s utilities.

The problem is likely to dominate the conversation again next year, exacerbated by concerns about data centers gobbling up power and Trump administration policies making it hard to build new electricity generation. Consumer advocates have called for officials to take bold action — including reducing utility profit rates and finally making it possible to build transmission lines — to alleviate the rising prices. We’ll see if any of those solutions actually come to fruition in 2026.

2 hours ago

The lack of any construction work at the site of a planned solar farm 18 months after the government approved it was causing uncertainty, a campaigner said.

The 2,500-acre (1,012-hectare) Sunnica Energy Farm project is set to span three separate sites on the Cambridgeshire-Suffolk border.

Catherine Judkins from Say No to Sunnica said: ""This sense of foreboding has been hanging over us... and our communities here face yet another year of fear and uncertainty.""

The developer said it would be in a ""better position"" to give a construction timeline once it knew the outcome of its non-material change application, a process used to make small alterations to an already approved project.

The Sunnica Energy Farm was approved in July 2024 by Energy Secretary Ed Miliband, who described solar power as ""crucial to achieving net-zero"".

But there has so far been no visible work on the three main sites, which are:

Sunnica East Site A, near West Row and Mildenhall in Suffolk

Sunnica East Site B, south of the village of Worlington, near Mildenhall

Sunnica West Site A, near Newmarket, north of the A14 in Cambridgeshire

The developers behind the project said they needed to make a non-material change application to ensure it could connect into Burwell substation.

Sunnica said the farm could power up to 172,000 homes and create 1,500 jobs during construction, with 27 full-time jobs to operate it.

Ms Judkins said: ""There are far better ways to deliver solar, together with communities and without the extensive harm that the Sunnica scheme will do.""

Suffolk County Council has also been ""opposed"" to the development.

Cabinet member Richard Rout said: ""It is for the developer to explain the delay to the delivery of their project.

""There is an open consultation regarding proposed amendments to the scheme, which closes on 16 January, to which the county council will be responding and we would encourage others to do the same.""

The BBC asked the Department for Energy Security and Net-Zero about the lack of progress.

A spokesperson said: ""Large-scale projects, such as Sunnica solar farm, often need to complete a range of post-consent work before starting construction.

""We have approved enough clean energy projects to power the equivalent of more than 7.5 million homes, helping get us off fossil fuels and deliver energy security so we can bring bills down for good.""

No indictment for Akron police officer who killed 15-year-old Jazmir Tucker

Akron police officer Davon Fields will not face criminal charges for the November 2024 killing of 15-year-old Jazmir Tucker, a Summit County grand jury determined on Oct. 2.

According to court records obtained by Signal Akron, Mahoning County prosecutors only asked grand jurors to consider a murder charge against Fields and, if they indicted him for murder, whether an additional firearms charge would apply.

The grand jury declined to indict Fields on either charge.

Voters elect three new members for Akron Board of Education

At Missing Falls Brewery the night of Nov. 4, the mood was buoyant as several candidates for the Akron Board of Education and their supporters watched the votes roll in.

Phil Montgomery, who hosted the gathering, led the pack of eight candidates from the time early vote totals began to come in. With all precincts reporting, Montgomery, the Summit County finance and budget director, won one of four seats to remake the embattled school board.

“This, my friends, is a mandate,” Montgomery said later from Rockne’s, where his watch party moved after Missing Falls closed. “This isn’t a fluke, this isn’t a one off. We are here to take our district back and do what’s right for our kids and our educators.”

Akron’s new Lock 3 park is a magnet that’s drawing people downtown

The $17 million renovation project sought to make Lock 3 an everyday destination instead of a place people only visit to see a concert. Winding pathways that follow the slope of the ground, a patio area with chairs and tables and landscaping that makes the canal itself more visible — patrons and planners alike say it’s had the desired effect.

The goal of the renovation was to turn the often-blocked-off park into Akron’s living room, said Kyle Kutuchief, the Akron program director for the Knight Foundation. He called it a home run project, saying he knew it had succeeded when he saw college students sunbathing in the park earlier this year as winter turned to spring.

What did the investigative report into Akron school superintendent’s behavior show?

After months of investigation into the embattled Akron Public Schools’ superintendent, a law firm hired by the school board concluded Michael Robinson had behaved in an “unprofessional, toxic, demeaning, and hostile manner” since he was appointed to the helm of the school district in July of 2023.

The 24-page report issued by the Brennan Manna Diamond (BMD) law firm and provided to school board members April 14 detailed serious allegations of retaliation against whistleblowers, hostility and threats toward perceived and real critics, insults made against students, public records law violations, and other damning allegations.

Man reported to have gun was unarmed when Akron police shot him outside Ellet bar

One week after an Akron police officer shot a man who had been kicked out of an Ellet bar, 911 audio documents that dispatchers were told the man had been threatening people with a gun.

But body-worn camera footage from Nov. 11 shows that the man was unarmed when a police officer shot him, 22 seconds after arriving on the scene. The footage was released within a week, as required by city law.

The footage documents that Officer Caleb Bodjanac fired 15 shots in three seconds at 36-year-old Corey Phillips, striking him at least twice in the chest, after a seemingly confused Phillips reached in the general direction of his jacket and pants pockets.

City’s lead water lines a thing of the past in Akron

The City of Akron has officially reached a milestone it has been working toward since the 1960s: the complete removal of city-owned lead water lines, which typically provide service from the street to the sidewalk edge closest to the house or structure.

“We’re very proud that, in about two weeks, we’re going to announce that we are going to be lead-free,” said Chris Ludle, Akron’s director of public service, during the Oct. 29 Ward 2 meeting.

After Akron removed the last few city-owned lead service lines, it became one of only a handful of American cities to be lead-free. It will now focus on replacing galvanized house lines that were previously connected to lead. This work is expected to be completed by 2027.

Grand jury clears Akron police officer in 2024 fatal shooting of Michael Jones

The Akron police officer who killed a 54-year-old Akron man at an East Avenue gas station in 2024 will not face criminal charges after a Summit County grand jury voted against issuing an indictment.

The Ohio attorney general’s law enforcement arm, the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation, investigated the killing of Michael Jones for eight months. The attorney general’s special prosecutors waited four months to present the case to a Summit County grand jury on Aug. 13, and that body declared within hours there wasn’t enough evidence to indict the officer.

Akron wins 2025 All-America City award for fourth time

The City of Akron was selected as a National Civic League All-America City for a fourth time in June in Denver.

As he accepted the award, Akron Mayor Shammas Malik said, “This Saturday, Akron is going to celebrate 200 years, and you have given us an incredible birthday present.”

Malik credited the city’s Lauren Marsh, assistant to the chief of staff, and Emma Lieberth Osborn, policy and grants strategist, who he said thought it was important to apply for the recognition.

“Akron is an All-America City because of the people who call it home,” Malik said.

Firm selected by Akron mayor to review police use of force is familiar face

After nearly a year of false starts, Akron Mayor Shammas Malik’s administration selected the firm that will review the Akron Police Department’s use-of-force policies, an issue he’s called a “matter of life or death” and “the most significant issue facing our city.”

The mayor’s original plan to hire New York law firm Paul, Weiss was shot down in February by Akron City Council. Council members balked at the potential $768,000 price tag and the secretive selection process before approving legislation requiring the city to have a more transparent bidding process, a significantly smaller price tag, and some sort of involvement with the University of Akron’s criminal justice program.

In late September, the city picked Police Executive Research Forum, a policing policy and research organization based in Washington, D.C., that it has previously done business with. For the use-of-force review, the firm was awarded a $328,873 contract — some of that money will fund work by employees at the University of Akron Department of Criminal Justice Studies — with the goal of doing the bulk of its work within the first three months of 2026.

Akron RubberDucks sold to Prospector Baseball Group

The Akron RubberDucks, the AA minor league affiliate of the Cleveland Guardians baseball team, have been sold. The new owners are Prospector Baseball Group. Co-founders John Abbamondi and Ben Boyer also purchased the Jacksonville Jumbo Shrimp, an affiliate of the Miami Marlins and the other minor league baseball team owned by previous RubberDucks owner Ken Babby and his Fast Forward Sports Group.

Ending nonprofit era in Akron: For-profit firm buys Summa Health for $515M, promises transformation

The nonprofit hospital system Summa Health has officially been acquired by a venture-capital-funded, for-profit company.

The $515 million sale to General Catalyst’s Health Assurance Transformation Company, known as HATCo, will mean more artificial intelligence and other technology will be used at Summa, as General Catalyst plans to use the hospital as a “test kitchen” for the more than 100 healthcare companies it’s invested in.

It means the end of Summa’s $850 million in debt, the end of a foundation that supported Summa and the beginning of the Trailhead Community Health Foundation. That foundation will be funded with an additional $15 million on top of the purchase price and with leftover proceeds from the sale after Summa’s debt has been retired — a total figure that is not yet known.

Akron’s Firestone Plant #1, and its clock tower, will be demolished, city confirms

The City of Akron has confirmed it intends to demolish Firestone Plant #1 in its entirety after rejecting a proposal to turn it into the new police headquarters.

The police headquarters proposal was the only one the city received in a last-ditch effort to find someone willing to redevelop the 115-year-old building. That idea came in after the deadline city officials set for proposals to be received, Stephanie Marsh, a spokesperson for Akron, said in an email.

The rejection means demolition of the building will continue to the front bay around March, with the entire building razed in April, although Akron City Council passed a new resolution mid-December asking the mayor to save at least the clock face.

Akron’s Quaker Square redevelopment: gelato, cigars, pickleball?

On a sunny Tuesday afternoon, the new owners of Quaker Square stood on the roof of the onetime grain silos, surveying Akron below.

From the top, unfinished floor of the silos-turned-hotel, they had climbed up a worn stepladder, through a rooftop hatch, to the building’s summit. With the owners were representatives from WRT, the Philadelphia planning and design firm hired to help design the master plan for the sprawling complex.

On the roof, John Keene, a principal and architect with the firm, held up his phone to capture Akron’s skyline. Inside, Jared McKnight, a senior associate with the firm, said he thought the building was incredible.

“There’s so much history layered in here,” McKnight said, standing on the unfinished floor. “I think anything is possible.”

Visitors enjoy first look inside Akron History Center

Nuggets of local history are among those now on display at the Akron History Center. On April 5, the long-awaited attraction in downtown Akron opened to visitors following the cutting of a “Ribbon of Rubber.”

Hundreds showed up for the grand opening. Nestled next to the Akron Civic Theatre and adjacent to Lock 3, the free museum doesn’t have an inch of space that isn’t thoughtfully covered by displays and homages to the Rubber City’s storied past.

The three-floor building on South Main Street houses more than 60 exhibits and 150 artifacts, accompanied by 30 flat screens with video presentations of historical figures and moments.

Police, fire, non-union and ‘white collar’ unionized City of Akron employees receive pay raises

The members of Akron’s police union and non-union City of Akron employees received retroactive and future pay raises, along with more than 500 additional city employees. Pay raises for the employees in unions representing Akron firefighters and many of the city’s “white collar” workers also received substantial raises.

The significant raises in the three collective bargaining agreements finalized this fall, and the legislation for slightly smaller raises for non-unionized city employees, were enacted months after City of Akron Director of Finance Steve Fricker told City Council that the police union contract raises alone would mean the city “would be facing fiscal caution by 2027 with less than 30 days cash on hand and, by 2029, would need to cut between 100-180 city jobs.”

Akron is adding more than 2,000 trees to its urban canopy

More than 2,000 new trees are taking root across Akron this year, marking one of the city’s most significant canopy gains in recent years. The growth comes through two complementary efforts: a large-scale street tree initiative led by the City of Akron and a federally funded neighborhood-based project known as Project ACORN.

Together, these investments are helping bring shade to low-canopy neighborhoods, improve air quality and begin addressing long-standing disparities in tree coverage across the city.

The biggest impact comes from Akron’s 2025 street tree planting plan, announced by Mayor Shammas Malik in February. The administration committed to planting 1,800 new trees in devil strips, focusing on South and Southwest Akron, where canopy levels have historically been lowest.

Akron sewer project nears completion, may save $230 million

Akron may be one step closer to saving nearly $230 million while still fulfilling the requirements of its water treatment consent decree.

The city presented a plan to the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency to update its Cuyahoga Street Storage Facility for about $30 million rather than build a new $265 million “enhanced high-rate treatment” facility (EHRT), the last step in the massive, $1 billion Akron sewer project.

Akron has made substantial progress in meeting the consent decree requirements, completing 24 of 26 mandated projects, with the Northside Interceptor Tunnel slated to be in use by the end of 2026. The $265 million treatment plant is the final project, which Akron has been trying to remove the city from the decree for years.

Cameras up! Three Goodyear blimps fly over Akron to celebrate 100th anniversary

In honor of the 100th anniversary of the first Goodyear blimp flight, three airships flew over the city June 3 during Akron Mayor Shammas Malik’s State of the City address at Lock 3 park as well the Akron RubberDucks game later.

Attendees at the mayor’s speech witnessed the three blimps circle downtown for hours, with the classic black and gray Wingfoot One, based in Akron, in the lead throughout. It was joined by its blimp brethren, the Florida-based Wingfoot Two and the California-based Wingfoot Three.

One of the most significant changes impacts bars and restaurants that serve alcohol, following years of concern from business owners about rising insurance costs.

A new law changing liquor liability and insurance requirements takes effect Thursday. Under a 2017 statute, bars and restaurants serving alcohol after 5 p.m. were required to carry a $1 million liability insurance policy to cover damages in civil lawsuits. Many owners said the cost of that coverage became unaffordable, forcing some businesses to close.

The new law allows businesses to carry lower insurance limits if they adopt certain risk-reduction measures, like stopping alcohol service at midnight or requiring alcohol server training for employees. They can get their requirement reduced as low as $300,000.

Even with the changes, it remains unclear whether the new requirements will lead to fewer lawsuits or lower premiums.

“Many people will actually believe the savings are simply based on the fact that you can purchase less insurance. But that actually should come secondary, secondary to what we would all hope would be fewer accidents, injuries and deaths involving intoxicated drivers,” said Robert Hartwig, a professor at the University of South Carolina’s Darla Moore School of Business.

As businesses decide whether to adopt the new risk-reduction measures, Hartwig said it could take time to see any real changes in insurance costs, including whether more companies are willing to offer coverage.

Another law taking effect Jan. 1 expands privacy protections for active and former law enforcement officers and judges. The change limits public access to their personal contact information in government records, particularly on publicly searchable government websites.

Some laws passed during the last legislative session will take effect later in the year. Part of a teacher reform package known as the Educator Assistance Act is scheduled to begin in July 2026, after the majority of the bill took effect in July 2025.

Under that law, school districts will be required to notify teachers in advance of the next school year whether they will have a job the following year. Districts must also provide teachers with their assignments at least 14 days before the start of the school year and limit certain reassignments without prior notice and a demonstrated need.

While Revolution Wind continues to seek to work constructively with the Administration and other stakeholders towards an expeditious and durable resolution of this matter, it believes that the lease suspension order violates applicable law. As was the case with the August 2025 stop-work order, the Revolution Wind Project (“Project”) faces substantial harm from a continuation of the lease suspension order. As a result, litigation is a necessary step to protect the rights of the Project.

Revolution Wind secured all required federal and state permits in 2023, following extensive reviews that began more than nine years ago. As a requirement of the permitting process, the Project engaged in years-long consultation with the U.S Department of Defense [War] Military Aviation and Installation Assurance Siting Clearinghouse to address potential impacts to national security and defense capabilities from construction through to operation of the Project. Those consultations resulted in a fully executed formal agreement between the Department of War, the Department of the Air Force, and Revolution Wind outlining mitigation measures by the Project.

Revolution Wind has spent and committed billions of dollars in reliance upon, and has met the requests of, a thorough review process. Additional federal reviews and approvals included the U.S. Coast Guard, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, National Marine Fisheries Service, and many other agencies.

Revolution Wind is in advanced stages of construction and is expected to be ready to deliver reliable, affordable power to American homes in 2026. The Project, now approximately 87 percent complete, has already installed all offshore foundations and 58 of 65 wind turbines. Export cable installation is complete, and both offshore substations have been installed. At the time of the lease suspension order, the Project was expected to begin generating power as soon as January 2026.

The Project will strengthen electric grid reliability as a critical part of the Northeast energy supply, which is crucial to meeting growing energy demand. The Project is set to provide affordable power to more than 350,000 homes in 2026 under 20-year power purchase agreements with utilities in Connecticut and Rhode Island. This includes supporting the growing power needs of data centers and AI, with experts including ISO-NE, the independent grid operator, warning that halting the Project may increase electricity costs and lower reliability for the region.

Revolution Wind has supported thousands of American jobs across construction, operations, shipbuilding, and manufacturing, including more than 1,000 union jobs that have already contributed 2 million union work hours to this Project. The Project is a part of Ørsted’s investment into American energy generation, grid upgrades, and port infrastructure, as well as a supply chain, including U.S. shipbuilding and manufacturing extending to more than 40 states.

Sunrise Wind LLC, a separate project and wholly owned subsidiary of Ørsted that also received a lease suspension order on December 22 continues to evaluate all options to resolve the matter, including engagement with relevant agencies and stakeholders and considering legal proceedings.

Oklo's technology is still a few years away from commercial deployment

Oklo develops advanced fission power plants known as Aurora powerhouses, but does not currently have a commercially operating business. Instead, it is investing heavily in research and development, obtaining Nuclear Regulatory Commission certifications, and securing customers for its next-generation nuclear plant technology.

Its Aurora powerhouses use metal-fueled fast-reactor technology based on the Experimental Breeder Reactor-II, which operated for 30 years at the Argonne National Laboratory until it was shut down in 1994. These reactors can run on recycled fuel, with the Aurora powerhouse designed to operate for over 10 years before refueling.

Oklo's Aurora powerhouses could address the biggest hurdle to AI expansion: the power grid connection gap. There is a growing mismatch between the speed at which data centers require power and the pace at which utilities can approve and build new grid connections to supply it.

Like Bloom's servers, its powerhouses could help meet energy needs quickly. However, the company doesn't expect its first commercial powerhouse to come online until 2027 or 2028.

The better stock to buy today

Oklo has its work cut out for it and won't be earning meaningful revenue until 2028 at the earliest. Its powerhouses are promising advanced nuclear technology that could help address future energy demand. Still, they won't be operational for a few years, leaving investors vulnerable to significant price swings at this early stage of the business.

Absolutely not! So in today’s Prognostications, we’ll try to avoid getting unhorsed as we delve into some of the most important and interesting developments we see ahead in 2026.

We’ll start at #10 and work our way up to #1.

10. Permian Gas Prices Stay Depressed Until the Late-2026 Pipeline Egress Overbuild.

With Permian natural gas production continuing to grow and pipeline egress constrained, gas prices at the Waha hub have been depressed for most of the past two years, with Waha below zero 42% of the time in 2024 and 24% of the time last year. Waha averaged $2.80/MMBtu below Henry Hub last year and hit $12/MMBtu under in late October. The good news? Relief is in sight. But it won’t be coming until the second half of 2026 when three pipeline projects are scheduled to come online: Kinder’s Gulf Coast Express expansion, Whitewater’s Blackcomb and the first part of Energy Transfer’s Hugh Brinson. Those projects total 4.5 Bcf/d of new capacity — more than enough to relieve the basin’s capacity constraints. At that time, the Permian discount (basis) to Henry Hub will shrink to less than $1/MMBtu and stay there for the next eight years. That’s because there is another 6 Bcf/d of new egress projects scheduled for 2027-29: Phase 2 of Hugh Brinson, Whitewater’s Eiger Express and Energy Transfer’s TransWestern expansion. That’s great news for producers. Maybe not so great for marketers holding capacity on egress pipelines.

9. More Canadian Oil Exports Headed to the U.S.

For the past five years, Canadian crude production has grown at a healthy 4% compound average growth rate (CAGR), and we project a continuation of that growth, albeit at about half the historical rate. Most of those incremental barrels will be coming to the U.S. Until the spring of 2024, all of Canada’s crude not consumed in the country (~15%) moved to the U.S. (mostly to refineries; some to re-export markets), but startup of the Trans Mountain Expansion (TMX) project pulled more barrels to British Columbia for export. Even though some of those exports ended up on the U.S. West Coast, total flows to the U.S. were down by about 100 Mb/d in 2025. In 2026, Canadian production growth will reverse that decline, and more Canadian barrels will flow to the U.S. on projects from Enbridge (a 30-Mb/d Express expansion into Montana in 2026 and a 150-Mb/d Mainline expansion in 2027) and various under-the-radar projects by other pipeline companies.

8. Good Times Roll for Natural Gas Storage.

In one of our prognostications two years ago, we asserted that U.S. natural gas storage was finally emerging from the economic wilderness. For much of the prior decade, storage values had been deeply depressed, the result of an overbuild following the late-2000s Shale Boom. By 2023, however, storage economics began to recover, driven by rapid LNG export growth, the need for gas to backstop intermittent wind and solar generation, and several disruptive weather events. At the time, we cautioned that this recovery would be uneven: mostly “brownfield” projects along the Gulf Coast, and mostly salt caverns, reflecting the rising value of high-deliverability injection and withdrawal capability rather than sheer working-gas volume. And that’s pretty much how it has played out — so far. But now, looking into 2026 and beyond, it appears a new wave of gas storage is coming. Rising demand for natural gas in power generation — driven by broader electrification, the rapid buildout of AI-driven data centers, and efforts to better coordinate gas and power markets — is boosting the need for additional storage. Unlike the recent cycle, this next phase is likely to include more greenfield developments, not only along the Gulf Coast but also in other regions of the U.S. and Canada.

7. Gas-Electric Coordination Will Finally Get Traction.

This one has seen only incremental improvements over the past 20 years but now looks poised to see some real progress. At least we hope so. The problem? Suffice to say that daily-scheduled gas pipelines and real-time-scheduled power generators don’t play well together. The problem keeps getting worse. Electric and gas folks have tried to harmonize their processes, but there have been few significant improvements. Until now. New demand for power — especially from data centers for AI — have both the electricity and gas markets fired up, so to speak. Natural gas now dominates U.S. power generation, supplying more than 40% of electricity, and the power sector has become the largest single consumer of gas. Yet pipelines originally built for steady local distribution company (LDC) loads are increasingly serving generators that ramp hard and fast whenever needed, often relying on interruptible natural gas service (versus more expensive firm service). At the same time, pipeline and storage capacity growth in the most vulnerable parts of the U.S. have lagged gas demand growth, reducing system flexibility. Add growing winter peaks, renewable intermittency and looming data-center load and the message is clear: Relying on interruptible gas is an unsustainable reliability risk. Those realities are driving a renewed push for real gas-electric coordination, led by Energy Secretary Chris Wright and a new National Petroleum Council (NPC) report (see Happy Together). We believe those initiatives will result in tangible progress, both on the regulatory and commercial fronts, starting in 2026.

6. A Lot More NGL Production Growth Is Coming.

Over the past 10 years, U.S. NGL production has grown at an 8.5% CAGR. That’s more than double the ~4% rate for crude oil and natural gas. Even though U.S. NGLs were up to 7.5 MMb/d in 2025, the growth rate was still near that elevated level, with production up about 500 Mb/d for the year, or about 30% more than U.S. crude oil. We’ve touted the NGL complex many times in the RBN blogosphere, attributing the high growth rate to gassier wells in the big NGL basins (more gas per barrel of oil), more NGLs per Mcf (thousand cubic feet) of gas produced, and a lot more new, high-efficiency gas processing plants. Of course, in 2025 about three-quarters of that volume growth came from the Permian, the undisputed king of NGL production. And that’s with gas production constrained by pipeline egress capacity. What would happen if pipeline egress were not constrained? Well, as we discussed in Prognostication #10, that’s exactly what is going to happen in H2 2026 and 2027. So, with more gas pipelines out of the basin and strong natural gas prices thanks to rising LNG exports and power-gen demand, it should look really good for NGLs over the next two years. Like another 500 Mb/d in 2026 while Permian gas remains constrained for half the year and blasting up to an 800-Mb/d gain in 2027 when gas is flowing freely — considerably more incremental barrels than crude oil.

5. Dry-Gas Islands Will Increasingly Impact Supply.

Lately there’s been a lot of market buzz around a handful of niche gas plays that share a common profile: the gas is dry, wells are deeper than legacy development in the area, reservoirs are often overpressured, initial production (IP) rates are high, and economics look compelling — especially with gas prices north of $4/MMBtu. One example is the Western Haynesville (primarily East Texas’s Leon and Freestone counties), where some wells can post eye-popping IPs approaching 40 MMcf/d, albeit from very deep, hot, long-lateral wells that are expensive to drill. A comparable story has been unfolding in the Eagle Ford Shale in South Texas’s Webb County, which over the past few years has emerged as a bona fide dry-gas play. Development there, most notably EOG Resources’ Dorado play, has gained enough momentum to justify dedicated takeaway, in particular an EOG-backed pipe to move gas to the Agua Dulce hub. Another example is the San Juan Basin (northwestern New Mexico and southwestern Colorado), where operators are ignoring legacy coalbed methane and targeting the deeper, horizontally drilled Mancos Shale. Our prognostication? These smaller “dry-gas islands,” alongside the core Louisiana/Texas dry-gas Haynesville, are likely to command much more attention in 2026, driven by stronger gas-price signals tied to LNG exports and power demand, and by a crude-price environment that’s looking a bit less supportive of oil-focused drilling.

4. The Crude Oil Drill Rig Efficiency Trend Will Continue.

Since 2022, the number of rigs drilling for oil in the U.S. has been on a steady decline, falling by roughly 8% per year. Over that same period, oil production has moved the other way, rising from about 12 MMb/d to 13.5 MMb/d, or roughly 4% annually. Said another way, in 2022, an average of 575 crude rigs were running (per Baker Hughes) when production was 12 MMb/d. By 2025, the average rig count had fallen to about 445, even as production climbed to an annual average of 13.5 MMb/d. Today, the oil-directed rig count is down to just over 400 and production is at 13.8 MMb/d. This isn’t a new story. More efficient rigs, longer laterals, faster cycle times, enhanced pad drilling, and improved completion designs have all driven sharply higher output per rig. Add in improved geosteering and tighter spacing optimization, and each rig now delivers far more barrels than it once did. Many pundits have expected this efficiency trend to fade as prime acreage is drilled up, but that slowdown hasn’t shown up yet — and we think it still has room to run. Producers are under constant pressure to do more with less, especially when crude prices soften. Furthermore, an aging well base means more production is coming from flatter parts of the decline curve — fewer new wells are needed to make up for legacy well declines. So forget the old 1:1 link between rigs and production. Our prognostication for 2026? Fewer rigs will support more crude oil output — a trend likely to continue for several more years.

3. Still More Hype Than Mcfs in Natural Gas for Data Centers.

We are going to stay contrarian on this one until proved wrong by the data. Last year we asserted that the hype around gas-fired power for data centers was getting way ahead of itself. Yep, natural gas demand for power generation actually fell by a couple of percent in 2025, with renewables displacing gas. But the hype continued to intensify during 2025, with some forecasts suggesting data centers could drive domestic gas demand for power higher on the order of 10-12 Bcf/d by 2030. Could that happen? We don’t think so. Optimistically, maybe half of those numbers will happen. We lump the obstacles to astronomical growth into four buckets. First, gas is likely to supply only about half of new data-center power demand, with the rest coming from renewables and the existing grid (including coal, nuclear and hydro). Second, data-center construction itself will likely fall short of projections due to constraints on hardware, labor, pipeline capacity and permitting. Third, data-center utilization will not run at full capacity 24/7 for several reasons, including uneven workloads, power and cooling constraints, and active load management. In addition, energy use per server is likely to decline as AI shifts from being dominated by energy-intensive training to less-intensive usage (what techies call “inference,” meaning asking questions and getting answers). Finally, maybe some of AI really is a bubble, and will struggle to recover the hundreds of billions in investment dollars. Don’t read this wrong. There will definitely be a significant increase in natural gas consumption coming from AI and other power-sector demand. Just not enough to singlehandedly blow the socks off the gas market.

2. Natural Gas Will Support Another Good Year for Ethane.

The price of ethane in 2025 was the highest since 2022 at 25.3 c/gal, mostly due to higher natural gas prices, which support ethane due to rejection economics. (Ethane not needed by U.S. crackers or the export market is rejected and sold as gas on a Btu-equivalent basis, so ethane should not fall below the price of gas — at least most of the time.) But compared to natural gas on a Btu basis, in 2025 ethane was the cheapest in 10 years, only 1.1X versus 1.4X in 2023, and 1.6X in 2018. In 2026, ethane should enjoy more support from natural gas, while the ratio of ethane to gas should stay about the same. Increasing production should push ethane lower relative to gas, but increasing exports and the startup of CPChem/QatarEnergy’s Golden Triangle Polymers ethane cracker (late 2026 or early 2027) will keep the ethane-to-gas ratio about the same as 2025 (1.1X). So if 2026 natural gas turns out to average $4.25/MMBtu (RBN’s MID scenario), then ethane would average 30.9 c/gal, a 22% year-on-year increase (based on ethane at 65,897 Btu/gal). There’s your 2026 price prognostication for the year: Ethane prices will see a 5.5 c/gal increase over 2025!",https://rbnenergy.com/sites/default/files/styles/social_image/public/single-use/2026-01/2026%20Year%20of%20the%20Horse.png?itok=vDxvjwJm,N,,2026-01-01 22:12:41.235364

CHENNAI: Battery electric vehicle penetration in India's two-wheeler and passenger vehicle segments lost momentum in 2025 after the reduction in GST rates for petrol- and diesel-powered vehicles from Oct, even as EV volumes saw healthy growth for the year. The narrowed price gap between internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles and EVs after GST reduction led to a spike in ICE sales in the Dec quarter, weighing on EV market share. The three-wheeler (3W) segment, however, stood out as an exception, recording an improvement in penetration levels during the year. In the two-wheeler (2W) segment, penetration of battery-powered vehicles rose from 6% in 2024 to a peak of 8.1% during the Jan-Sept 2025 period. However, a lower EV share in the Dec quarter, which was the first post-GST rate-cut quarter led to overall E2W penetration for 2025 to be 6.3%. Similarly, EV penetration (excluding hybrid models) in the passenger vehicle (PV) segment, including cars and SUVs, improved from 2.5% in 2024 to nearly 4% for the year. In contrast, electric three-wheeler penetration (excluding e-rickshaws) increased sharply from 12% in 2024 to 18% in 2025. Despite the pressure on penetration, EV sales growth remained robust across segments. Total registrations of battery-powered EVs-including 2W, 3W, cars and SUVs-rose 16% year-on-year to 22.7 lakh units in 2025, up from 19.5 lakh units in 2024, Vahan data showed. The electric two-wheeler segment reported an 11% increase in volumes to 12.8 lakh units in 2025, up from 11.5 lakh units a year earlier. The electric PV segment (excluding hybrids) delivered the strongest performance, with registrations surging 77% to 1.8 lakh units from about 99,500 units in 2024, aided by aggressive expansion by existing players and the entry of new manufacturers. Electric three-wheeler volumes grew 15% year-on-year to 8 lakh units, compared with 6.9 lakh units in 2024, with e-rickshaws accounting for around 70% of total E3W sales during the year.

It was five decades ago when they began their labours here amid the endless swaths of sweet clover, alfalfa and the variety of other plant life that bees thrive on.

North Dakota has long been a top honey producer, churning out 40 million pounds every year and bringing in close to US$67 million. All of it courtesy of these undulating fields of wild grasses, and the buzzing insects who return to them each year.

“It was bee paradise,” said Jason Miller.

But not anymore. That paradise is slowly being transformed into a heaving ocean of corn and soybeans. Corn production in North Dakota alone has quadrupled to 16.5 million acres since the turn of the century, crowding out the diverse vegetation bees depend on.

Part of the reason has been the growing use of corn and soybean ethanol in biofuel, which mixes agricultural and waste feedstocks with fossil fuels for use in combustion engines. But more recently, it’s the promise of a newer biofuel that agricultural lobbyists and some environmentalists hope may someday supplant an intractable source of greenhouse gas emissions: jet fuel.

The Energy Policy Act of 2005 created a US renewable fuel standard in part to decrease dependence on foreign oil. In 2021, president Joe Biden’s “Sustainable Airline Fuel Grand Challenge” turbocharged interest in jet biofuel, offering tax breaks to encourage production of three billion gallons of it by decade’s end. The aim was to help shrink the carbon footprint of air travel while locking in demand for US corn and soybeans, especially as the rise of electric vehicles (EVs) shrinks traditional ethanol use in cars.

Biofuels also can be made from animal fats, algae, waste cooking oils or agricultural waste such as wood chips and straw. While the US Environmental Protection Agency is to evaluate all of the pathways for corn or soybeans to produce sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), the agricultural industry and its lobbyists continue to prepare for what they hope is a fait accompli.

In the last year, US production capacity of SAF jumped from 5,000 to 30,000 barrels per day, according to government estimates, with much of the increase tied to new facilities coming online. And despite conflicting signals from the White House, the Trump administration just unfroze a US$1.67 billion Biden-era loan for biofuel processing plants.

The downside of making jet biofuel from corn or soybean production is that it will likely fuel significant land transformation, according to several expert analyses, including one by Braden Limb, a research scientist at Colorado State University. According to his study, about 50 per cent more cropland is needed for corn and soybeans to meet the 2050 SAF production goals.

“The maximum amount of land that we have converted to cropland in a single year (roughly 1.8 million acres), would have to be quadrupled every year for the next 30 years,” said Limb. And while collateral damage from efforts to slow global warming is not a new phenomenon, the expanded use of undeveloped land for biofuel-friendly monocultures and its destructive effect on bee populations could be especially significant for food production, the broader environment-and people such as Jason Miller.

“We used to make 140 pounds of honey per beehive,” he said. But these days, Miller’s bee colonies appear to be weakening. This year, he averaged only 33 pounds.

The bees that once thrived in North Dakota and places like it are the backbone of a US$400 million paid US pollination industry. Miller’s bees follow a pollination circuit in the spring, from almonds to apple and stone fruit orchards throughout the West. By late summer, they return to North Dakota to produce honey.

Honeybees populations already face a number of stressors-disease, pesticides and poor nutrition. Stressed bees are vulnerable to colony collapses: only a year ago US beekeepers lost more than half of their hives, according to an industry study. Katrina Klett, a doctoral student at the University of Minnesota who studies land use change and honeybee health, has seen up close the negative effects of grasslands giving way to to corn.

“What I fear is that we are not going to attach the environmental ethics to sustainable aviation fuel,” Klett said. “If we properly attach environmental metrics and outcomes to tax credit payments, we could move the needle to support farmers to adopt practices that increase diversity on the landscape.”

But as demand for air travel soars, so does aviation’s climate impact. According to the International Air Travel Association, air traffic rose more than 10 per cent between 2023 and 2024, making it one of the fastest-growing sources of greenhouse gas emissions. Aviation contributes roughly 2.5 per cent of global carbon dioxide emissions but is responsible for at least 3.5 per cent of human-caused climate change.

Airlines have been exploring the few options available to lower emissions, including SAF. The industry has committed to biofuel use and the International Civil Aviation Organization adopted an ambitious target of achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, which would require significant biofuel inputs. Researchers such as Limb point to crops other than corn or soybeans, like sorghum and miscanthus, that can be used for biofuel but aren’t as damaging to ecosystems.

“All of our optimisation work,” Limb said, “says corn and soybeans are not the answer.”

There are forces at work that may yet forestall the mass repurposing of grasslands for biofuel. In 2022, the 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit, created by Biden’s landmark Inflation Reduction Act, crafted more incentives for domestic production and sale of low-carbon transportation fuels. But the Republican tax and spending bill passed this summer, while extending the credit, decreased the US$1.75 per gallon credit for SAF to US$1. Without that added subsidy, it may be difficult for SAF to be cost-competitive with regular jet fuel. (The bill did, however, change how biofuel sustainability is calculated in a way that makes it easier for producers to qualify while still clear-cutting forests or eliminating grasslands).

“Existing policy incentives make renewable diesel more profitable for most biofuel producers.”

There are other reasons SAF may still be too expensive to justify the investment. Jet fuel purity standards require complex processing and specialised equipment, and current feedstocks for SAF-including virgin vegetable oils-are typically more expensive than other biofuels. “Existing policy incentives make renewable diesel more profitable for most biofuel producers,” said Andrew Swanson, an agricultural economist at Montana State University.

Still, agricultural lobbies continue to express eagerness when it comes to jet biofuel given the effect EV use is having on corn and soybean ethanol markets. While pushing for a higher percentage of ethanol in petrol blends used in land transportation, organisations such as the National Corn Growers Association and state-based trade groups are seeking more government incentives to use corn and soybeans for SAF.

Another driver of aviation biofuel is the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (Corsia), an initiative that aims to stabilise greenhouse gas emissions from international flights. Corsia is a three-phase international agreement-the first two phases were voluntary, but beginning in 2027, Corsia becomes mandatory for most of international aviation, with some exceptions. Under the agreement, airlines must measure, report, verify and offset emissions that exceed the 2019 baseline.

For environmentalists, just the threat of SAF-directed agriculture in places such as North Dakota is a sobering thought, especially given what’s happened elsewhere. A new study by researchers at the University of California, Davis, found biofuel demand drove the conversion of 1.7 million hectares of forest to oil palm production in Indonesia and Malaysia between 2002 and 2018.

Turning wild grasslands into homogenous fields of corn and soybeans remains a “very real problem for biofuels”, said Jeremy Martin, director of fuels policy at the non-profit Union of Concerned Scientists, in a Nov 5 blog post. But there are other troubling consequences of the US biofuels push. Proposals for its production far exceed current domestic availability, meaning current mandates can only be met with imports and diverting vegetable oil from food to fuel, which will raise the cost of both while accelerating deforestation.

Swanson said the wild card in the SAF debate is trade, noting that the US exported almost two billion gallons of corn ethanol last year. “If US exports decline,” he said, “then we will need to find ways to increase domestic consumption-increasing land use change pressure”.

SAF advocates such as Veronica Bradley, director of environmental science for the industry lobby Clean Fuels Alliance America, counter that existing biofuel sources-used vegetable oil, beef tallow and forestry wastes-could satisfy near-term demand, as could shifting uses for corn ethanol amid the EV boom. For now, it appears the uncertainty over regulatory policies and incentives has put both the threat and promise of SAF, and in some respects the expanded use of biofuels in general, on hold.

“There is no real indication that we will move towards a clear, widely applicable standard for assessing land-use change and biodiversity impacts,” said Swanson. “This puts the SAF industry in a difficult position. Contradictory policy standards will mean that by catering to one market, you are cutting off the opportunity to produce for a different market.”

Back in North Dakota, Klett said beekeeping families such as hers and the Millers remain worried about what comes after that uncertainty lifts. “Folks are concerned about how sustainable aviation fuel production could change the landscape,” she said, “unless we get the rules right”.

BEIJING — Chinese auto giant BYD sold 2.26 million electric vehicles last year, a company statement showed Thursday, setting a new record for any firm globally.

The figure puts BYD in pole position to outstrip Elon Musk's Tesla in the annual category for the first time, with the lagging Texas-based firm having previously announced 1.22 million in 2025 EV sales by the end of September.

Tesla is expected to announce its total EV sales for last year on Friday.

Shenzhen-based BYD, which also produces hybrid cars, announced the data in a statement published to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, where it is listed.

Known as ""Biyadi"" in Chinese, or by the English slogan ""Build Your Dreams"", BYD was founded in 1995, originally specialising in battery manufacturing.

The automotive juggernaut has come to dominate China's highly competitive new energy vehicle market, the world's largest.

Now it is seeking to expand its presence overseas, as increasingly price-wary consumption patterns in China weigh on profitability.

BYD and its Chinese competitors face hefty tariffs in the United States.

But its success is growing in Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and even Europe, to the consternation of traditional industry heavyweights from the continent.

Tesla narrowly beat BYD in annual EV sales in 2024, with US company's 1.79 million just outpacing the latter's 1.76 million.

This year, Musk's firm has seen sales struggle in key markets over the CEO's political support of US President Donald Trump and far-right politicians.

Tesla has also faced rising EV competition from BYD and other Chinese companies, as well as from European giants.",https://newvision-media.s3.amazonaws.com/cms/661aac96-7614-4898-960b-98a6ebe82651.jpg,N,,2026-01-01 17:57:21.577642

2025 was a year of turmoil for many scientists — particularly in the United States, where job cuts and budget slashing have left many reeling. But it was also a year of promising advances in fields from gene therapy to quantum computing.

In the U.S., executive orders by President Donald Trump led to the loss of thousands of jobs in government agencies, including NASA, which oversees space exploration, and NOAA, which runs the National Weather Service, among other vital activities. Thousands of health-related research grants — especially those with any perceived link to diversity, equity and inclusion — were canceled or withheld. And Harvard and other universities saw billions of dollars held back, at least temporarily.

Trump’s budget proposal for 2026 (the U.S. budget had not been finalized as Knowable Magazine went to press) features huge cuts to science funding, including slicing the budget for the National Science Foundation, the main granting agency for basic science research, in half. And cuts that have already been made spell bad news for global efforts to quash diseases and keep climate change in check.

Amid all the bad news, there have also been lives saved, technologies advanced and some very weird science conducted. Here are some of the things that captured Knowable’s attention in 2025.

Vaccine hits and misses

Public health faced big challenges this year. “There have been enormous changes in 2025, really driven by the current [U.S.] administration and their attitude towards both foreign aid and domestic vaccine policy,” says epidemiologist William Moss at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and coauthor of an Annual Review of Public Health article on global vaccinations. The U.S. withdrew from the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2025, for example, and said it would pull funding from Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance.

Experts are worried that increasing gaps in vaccination coverage will contribute to further outbreaks of infectious diseases previously thought to be under control. This year, for example, measles surged in North America: Canada lost its “measles elimination” status in November, with cases much higher than anything seen in decades, and the U.S. may follow in 2026. Whooping cough is also on the rise.

Over the past 50 years, immunization has saved an estimated 154 million lives globally. Maintaining that is proving hard. The 2020 pandemic caused disruptions to vaccination campaigns, and many have not yet recovered to pre-pandemic levels. Part of the problem is growing anti-vax sentiments. In the United States, vaccine coverage in kindergartners has crept downward from around 95% to 92% over the past dozen years, with exemptions from one or more recommended vaccines reaching a record high of 3.6% in the 2024-25 school year. These trends could signal trouble ahead.

There is some good news. After three years of negotiation, delegates to the WHO (not including the U.S.) adopted a Pandemic Agreement with a better system for equitably sharing vaccines and drugs. Coverage with the HPV (human papillomavirus) vaccine, which protects against the sexually transmitted virus that causes cervical cancer in women and some throat cancers in men, continues to increase. And despite the cancellation of $500 million in funding for messenger RNA (mRNA) research in the United States, researchers are increasingly enthusiastic about mRNA vaccines, following on their success during the COVID-19 pandemic. Early research suggests that mRNA vaccines could be particularly promising in the fight against cancer.

HIV hope — and setbacks

This year saw some good news on the HIV front. Experimental infusions of neutralizing antibodies allowed some people with HIV to achieve remissions lasting months or years without the usual daily doses of antiretroviral drugs. And in July, the WHO endorsed twice-a-year injections of a long-lasting, highly effective injectable drug called lenacapavir for HIV prevention, following on the heels of U.S. approval for that use. Experts say this marks a momentous shift for people at risk of HIV. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said: “While an HIV vaccine remains elusive, lenacapavir is the next best thing.”

These new treatments may be especially valuable given the Trump administration’s decision this year to dismantle programs run by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). This includes the disruptions to the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) that delivered a huge and shocking blow to the global HIV/AIDS effort this year. As a result, the United Nations effort UNAIDS — to which USAID used to be the largest donor — could be shuttered in 2026, four years ahead of schedule.

All this has left experts and advocates reeling, as the number of people living with HIV — still one of the world’s most deadly viruses — continues to climb. UNAIDS predicts that if the PEPFAR funds permanently disappear, there could be over 6 million additional HIV infections and an additional 4 million AIDS-related deaths by 2029. “The sudden withdrawal of lifesaving support is having a devastating impact,” said UNAIDS Executive Director Winnie Byanyima at a press briefing in March. “It is very serious.”

Spectacular space advances

Astronomers rejoiced as the new Vera C. Rubin Observatory, built atop a mountain in Chile, came online this year. The telescope hosts the world’s biggest camera, at 3.2 billion pixels, and is expected to gather more data in its first year than all previous optical telescopes combined. The project aims to catalog some 5 million asteroids, including 100,000 near-Earth objects, over the next decade. It will also help to study dark matter and objects such as supernovae, and pursue new discoveries, including optical signals of gravitational waves. “The Rubin Observatory promises to impact virtually every area of astronomy and astrophysics, often profoundly,” says astronomer Robert Kennicutt at the University of Arizona, coeditor of the Annual Review of Astronomy and Astrophysics.

Among the more unusual targets that Rubin will help to spot are interstellar objects — hunks of rock or ice blasting through our solar system from elsewhere. So far, astronomers have only detected three such objects, including 3I/ATLAS, which made its closest approach to Earth in December. It is suspected that there are many more to find; Rubin could spot dozens over the next decade.

Personalized gene editing gets started

Since the first gene therapy treatment based on CRISPR — which uses molecular scissors to precisely cut and modify DNA — was approved in 2023 for sickle cell disease, efforts to develop other treatments have ramped up. Therapies are under investigation for a host of conditions including type 1 diabetes, various cancers and even high cholesterol.

But the big headline this year was the first personalized gene therapy: A baby boy with a life-threatening genetic condition became the first to receive a customized therapy, using a CRISPR-based technique that can precisely edit individual DNA letters. Personalized CRISPR treatments could allow doctors to effectively treat people suffering from rare or even unique life-threatening conditions. Such diseases collectively affect hundreds of millions of people worldwide.

The team behind the baby boy’s successful procedure announced this October their intention to try similar treatments in more children starting in 2026, and in November, the Food and Drug Administration launched a new pathway to market for these procedures. A Center for Pediatric CRISPR Cures in California was also created in July to help families facing ultra-rare diseases. Funded by the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, the center will be led by researchers at UC Berkeley and UC San Francisco. “I know firsthand the heartbreak of telling parents that we don’t understand their child’s illness or that we don’t know how to treat them,” Priscilla Chan, pediatrician and co-CEO of the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, said in a press release about the new center.

Hopes raised for more transplants

This year brought important progress for xenotransplantation, the practice of using donor organs from pigs or other animals for people who need transplants. While only a handful of people have so far received pig hearts or kidneys — in special cases where they had no other options — those cases are blazing a trail toward making this technique a clinical reality. “The numbers are small but mighty,” says Joseph Ladowski, a surgeon and researcher in transplant immunology at Duke University.

This year brought several experimental transplants of pig organs (including the first lung), with one pig kidney lasting nearly nine months, a new record, before failing. Most importantly, in February the FDA green-lit the first multiperson trials of pig kidney transplants, which will allow doctors to standardize and optimize the technique. We should see half a dozen more transplants of animal organs in 2026, says Ladowski, with numbers ramping up steeply after that.

Another exciting development happening in parallel may also help ease the global shortage of donor organs: using an enzyme to convert the blood type of donated organs, removing antigens that can result in rejection in both human and animal transplants. In October, a team reported the first transplant of a human kidney that had its blood type converted from type A to universal donor type O.

Potential treatment for Huntington’s disease

This year, researchers reported a small but promising study in which they slowed the progression of Huntington’s disease, an inherited disorder that gradually breaks down neurons, causing uncontrollable movements and a progressive degradation of behavior and thought. The treatment, by the Amsterdam-based company uniQure, is the first to address the disease itself rather than simply easing its symptoms.

Researchers engineered a harmless virus to deliver small molecules called microRNAs designed to block the action of the defective gene that causes Huntington’s. Then they infused the virus into targeted regions of the brains of 29 patients. In those who got the higher of two doses, the treatment slowed the progression of the disease by 75%, the team found. The result is “a remarkable step forward for patients and families,” says Andreas Keller, a bioinformatician at Saarland University in Germany who studies potential clinical applications of microRNAs. “This is a convincing proof-of-concept.”

As the climate crisis deepens, renewables get energized

This year continued the growing momentum of the renewable energy transition, thanks in large part to the plummeting cost of solar power. According to an October report from the think tank Ember, the first half of 2025 saw renewable energy provide more than a third of global electricity, squeaking ahead of coal for the first time.

But that’s rare good news in a grim climate picture. U.S. policy, notably, is generally moving against renewable energy: In a speech to the United Nations in September, President Donald Trump said, “If you don’t get away from the green energy scam, your country is going to fail.”

Worldwide efforts to fight climate change are seriously off target, according to the UN Environment Programme. Global emissions of carbon dioxide may have declined slightly in 2025, but they need to be falling much faster if we are to hit our climate targets. Experts now say we will miss the goal of limiting the warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, but action can still help to stave off catastrophic consequences to ecology and humankind. “Every small fraction of a degree matters,” says Diana Ürge-Vorsatz, an environmental scientist and climate expert at Central European University and vice chair of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The latest data put 2025 as the second- or third-hottest year on record, after record-breaking 2024, with an annual average temperature about 1.48 degrees Celsius above the pre-industrial average.

Porous metals come of age

A class of materials called metal organic frameworks (MOFs) hit the headlines this year with Nobel Prize recognition, along with the first signs of commercial applications. MOFs are the world’s most porous materials: crystals of metal ions linked by long organic molecules. Their porosity could make these molecular sponges useful as storage containers for gases or drugs.

“MOFs are very elegant, scientifically, and highly versatile,” says Ram Seshadri, a chemist and materials scientist at UC Santa Barbara and editor of the Annual Review of Materials Research.

Although they have been a scientific curiosity for decades, MOFs are now starting to gain traction in applications — in part because artificial intelligence has massively sped up the hunt for new MOF formulations with desired properties, and in part because of increased interest in sucking carbon dioxide out of the air to fight climate change. This May, a company launched a new factory for making MOF sponges to capture carbon dioxide from ambient air. Others are investigating using MOFs to harvest water from the air in desert regions, store hydrogen gas to use as a zero-carbon fuel, and even deliver drugs within the body.

Quantum computing gears up

Quantum computing made significant progress this year. Quantum computers are built from qubits, which exploit quantum behaviors to offer faster computation but are also inherently unstable and error-prone. To make a practically useful quantum computer, designers have to create a multi-qubit system that produces a lower overall error rate than seen in the individual bits. There have been a few recent practical demonstrations of this “quantum error correction” process. And then in October, Google announced that its “quantum echoes” algorithm proved 13,000 times faster than a classical computer at predicting molecular structures — one of the first potentially practical applications.

That’s not the only quantum computing news this year. The 2025 Nobel Prize in physics went to some of the foundational research for quantum computing (fittingly, given that 2025 was also UNESCO’s International Year of Quantum Science and Technology). “Quantum computing is definitely accelerating,” says William Oliver, a quantum engineer at MIT. “It’s pretty exciting.”

Pollution perils stack up

The global effort to manage pollution faced big setbacks this year. In March, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced more than 30 acts of deregulation, many aiming to remove controls it claims were “throttling” the oil and gas industries. In August, the EPA proposed rescinding its foundational 2009 Endangerment Finding, which concluded that greenhouse gas emissions are air pollutants that endanger public welfare. Rescinding the finding would eliminate the legal basis for the EPA’s climate-based regulations. A long list of rules being rolled back is being compiled by Harvard University’s environmental and energy law program, while the Natural Resources Defense Council is tracking canceled and frozen environmental funding.

On the international stage, a hoped-for treaty to end plastic pollution fell apart this summer as participants fought over the scope of what the treaty could reasonably cover and the strength of its promises. While negotiations are expected to resume at some point in the future, for now it is up to individual governments to set their own rules for reducing plastic pollution.

Meanwhile, controversial efforts to mine the ocean bottom for minerals took a step forward despite studies showing negative impacts of test mining on seafloor life. Mining in international waters falls under the purview of the International Seabed Authority, which is developing a Mining Code to regulate this activity. But in April, the Metals Company sidestepped this process by seeking a permit directly from the United States, which has not ratified the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea that governs the seabed authority. Trump issued an executive order in April to fast-track such mining applications. A final decision is still pending.

Mighty mitochondria: More than just powerhouses

The term “mitochondrial dysfunction” featured heavily in headlines this year as politicians and researchers alike leaned in to the idea that malfunctions of this subcellular structure may underlie chronic diseases ranging from Parkinson’s to cancer, diabetes and more. “It’s becoming more and more recognized that once you perturb mitochondria, a whole bunch of diseases can occur,” says Andrew Dillin, a molecular and cell biologist at the University of California, Berkeley.

Mitochondria, long called “the powerhouses of cells” because they convert nutrients into chemical fuel, turn out to do much more than that. In particular, these little structures inside our cells — which probably evolved from ancient bacteria — have retained their ancient abilities to communicate, making them a major hub for cell signaling and a big player in regulating stress, immunity and metabolism.

Work this year showed that they can, for example, act as a “watchtower” against bacterial infection, detecting invading pathogens and helping the immune system mount a response. Mitochondria seem to be critical for memory formation in immune T cells, have an unexpected role in tissue healing, and might be targeted to help us live healthier for longer in old age.

And finally …

A couple of fun science stories that captured the world’s attention early this year are worth noting, even though some observers have poured cold water on the findings.

In April, Texas-based Colossal Biosciences announced it had genetically re-created dire wolves, a large-bodied wolf species that last roamed North America more than 11,000 years ago. To be precise, the company made 20 genetic tweaks to 14 locations in the genome of gray wolves. Debate erupted about whether this really amounts to re-creating dire wolves, which are thought to differ from gray wolves by about 12 million letters of DNA. (Most experts say no.)

The work “marks a technical achievement in genome editing and synthetic embryology,” wrote stem cell biologist Dusko Ilic from King’s College London in a commentary. But, he adds, “what has been achieved is not resurrection, but simulation.” Work continues to “de-extinct” other animals, from the dodo to the woolly mammoth. Whether this is achievable or desirable is a matter of opinion. Other genetic techniques are also being used to try to save living species on the brink of extinction, such as the northern white rhino.

Another quirky headline-grabbing story came when scientists made people see a color no one had ever experienced before. Researchers used a laser to directly stimulate just one of the three types of color-sensitive cone cells in the retina: the M cone, which is most sensitive to medium-wavelength light. That never happens in the real world, because any light that stimulates the M cone would also stimulate the neighboring S (short) and L (long) cones to some degree. The five people who experienced this odd light show said the result looked “green-blue,” a color dubbed “olo” by the researchers. The work is a fun exploration of the weird and wonderful world of color perception.",https://www.edhat.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/knowable-top-science-stories-of-2025.jpg,N,,2026-01-01 18:58:10.356408

Oklo Inc. (NYSE: OKLO) remains the champion of the ""Next.""","As the sun rises on 2026, the global financial markets remain fixated on a singular, insatiable demand: power. The ""AI Power Rush"" of 2025 has fundamentally reshaped the energy sector, transforming once-niche clean energy companies into the backbones of the modern economy. For investors, the debate has narrowed down to two primary contenders for the 2026 crown: the proven scalability of fuel cells versus the disruptive promise of next-generation nuclear energy.

The previous year saw an unprecedented surge in capital expenditure from Big Tech, as the ""Grid Gap""—the growing disparity between utility-scale electricity supply and the power requirements of massive AI clusters—forced a shift toward ""behind-the-meter"" solutions. Bloom Energy (NYSE: BE) and Oklo Inc. (NYSE: OKLO) emerged as the primary beneficiaries of this shift, each offering a distinct pathway to energy independence for data center operators. As we enter 2026, the choice between these two stocks defines the broader tension between immediate reliability and long-term exponential growth.

The Year of the ""Grid Gap"": A 2025 Retrospective

The year 2025 was marked by a series of landmark agreements that validated the decentralization of the American power grid. Bloom Energy (NYSE: BE) transitioned from a clean-energy alternative to a critical infrastructure provider, capped by a massive $5 billion partnership with Brookfield Asset Management. This deal, announced in late 2025, positioned Bloom as the preferred on-site power provider for Brookfield’s global network of AI factories. Throughout the year, Bloom’s ability to deploy fuel cell capacity in as little as 90 days allowed it to bypass the multi-year interconnection queues that have crippled traditional utility expansion.

Meanwhile, Oklo Inc. (NYSE: OKLO) spent 2025 shattering regulatory expectations. Despite being a pre-revenue company, Oklo’s valuation soared as the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) adopted an ""accelerated timeline"" for its licensing process. In September 2025, the NRC accepted Oklo’s Principal Design Criteria (PDC) report in just 15 days—a process that historically took months. This regulatory tailwind, combined with the benefits of the ADVANCE Act which slashed licensing fees by over 50%, moved Oklo’s 2027 commercial deployment target from a speculative dream to a tangible project timeline.

The market reaction was nothing short of explosive. Bloom Energy’s stock finished 2025 up nearly 300%, trading in the $85 to $90 range by year-end, while Oklo saw a 250% gain, peaking at $120 before consolidating around $60. These moves were supported by a broader industry realization: the traditional grid is no longer sufficient for the AI era. Key players like American Electric Power (NASDAQ: AEP) and Equinix (NASDAQ: EQIX) became central to this narrative, signing massive master service agreements to integrate these non-traditional power sources directly into their infrastructure.

Winners, Losers, and the Battle for the Data Center

In this evolving landscape, Bloom Energy (NYSE: BE) enters 2026 as the ""safe"" play for investors seeking immediate cash flow. Having reported four consecutive quarters of record revenue and positive free cash flow in 2025, Bloom has silenced critics who long questioned its path to profitability. The company is currently on track to double its manufacturing capacity to 2 gigawatts (GW) by the end of 2026. For data center giants like Oracle (NYSE: ORCL), Bloom offers a ""plug-and-play"" solution that provides immediate relief from the power shortages currently stalling GPU cluster expansions.

Oklo Inc. (NYSE: OKLO), conversely, represents the ""high-beta"" bet on the future of energy. With a customer pipeline that ballooned to over 14 GW by the end of 2025, the company’s potential is vast, but its risks remain tied to the bureaucratic gears of the NRC. The winners in the Oklo story are the long-term visionaries—companies like Liberty Energy (NYSE: LBRT) and Vertiv (NYSE: VRT) that have partnered with Oklo to secure future energy density that fuel cells simply cannot match at scale.

The primary ""losers"" in this scenario are the legacy utilities that failed to modernize. As major industrial customers move ""behind-the-meter"" with Bloom or Oklo, traditional power providers face a ""utility death spiral"" where their most profitable customers exit the grid, leaving a smaller base to pay for aging infrastructure. Investors have begun rotating out of slow-growth utility ETFs and into the ""Power Infrastructure"" cohort, where Bloom and Oklo sit at the very top.

The Broader Significance: Decoupling from the Grid

The rise of BE and OKLO is not just a story of two successful stocks; it is a symptom of a broader industrial decoupling. The 2025 energy crisis proved that the centralized grid is a single point of failure for the AI economy. This has led to a policy shift in Washington, where the 2025 Executive Orders streamlined permitting for reactors on federal land and provided tax credits for hydrogen-ready fuel cells. These regulatory shifts have created a permanent floor for the valuations of companies that can provide ""islanded"" power solutions.

Historically, this shift mirrors the transition from mainframe computing to distributed PC networks. Just as computing moved from centralized rooms to every desk, power is moving from centralized plants to every data center campus. This trend has significant ripple effects on the supply chain. Companies specializing in cooling technology and power management, such as Vertiv (NYSE: VRT), have seen their fortunes rise in tandem with Bloom and Oklo, as the complexity of managing on-site power plants requires advanced digital infrastructure.

Furthermore, the competition between fuel cells and Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) is driving rapid innovation. In 2025, Bloom Energy successfully demonstrated 100% hydrogen-ready fuel cells at scale, while Oklo finalized its fuel fabrication plans using recycled nuclear waste. This technological arms race is accelerating the global transition to carbon-free energy, not because of environmental mandates, but because of the sheer economic necessity of the AI revolution.

What Comes Next: The 2026 Catalysts

Looking ahead at the remainder of 2026, several key catalysts will determine if these stocks can maintain their momentum. For Bloom Energy (NYSE: BE), the focus is entirely on execution and margin expansion. Investors will be watching the completion of the 2 GW manufacturing expansion; any delays in scaling could hurt the stock’s premium valuation. The conversion of the $5 billion Brookfield backlog into recognized revenue will be the primary metric for success in the first half of the year.

For Oklo Inc. (NYSE: OKLO), 2026 is a ""make-or-break"" regulatory year. The market is currently pricing in a successful Draft Safety Evaluation from the NRC, expected in the second quarter. If Oklo receives a favorable report, it will de-risk the 2027 deployment of its first Aurora powerhouse in Idaho, potentially sending the stock toward the $100 mark again. However, any regulatory ""hiccup"" or request for additional data could lead to significant volatility, as the company remains pre-revenue and dependent on investor sentiment.

Strategic pivots may also be on the horizon. We may see Bloom Energy move more aggressively into the hydrogen economy as infrastructure for the fuel matures, while Oklo could announce further partnerships with sovereign wealth funds looking to power national AI initiatives. The emergence of ""Energy-as-a-Service"" (EaaS) models will likely become the standard for how these companies contract with Big Tech, moving away from capital-heavy sales to long-term, high-margin power purchase agreements.

Investor Takeaway: Scaling vs. Speculation

As of January 1, 2026, the energy sector has been permanently bifurcated. Bloom Energy (NYSE: BE) stands as the champion of the ""Now,"" providing the essential power that is currently keeping the AI revolution from hitting a wall. With a consensus ""Buy"" rating and a price target of $117.50, it is the preferred choice for institutional investors seeking exposure to the AI infrastructure trade with the safety of proven earnings.

Oklo Inc. (NYSE: OKLO) remains the champion of the ""Next."" It is a speculative powerhouse that offers the only realistic solution for the massive energy requirements of 2030 and beyond. While its $85.00 median price target suggests significant upside, it is a stock for those with a high risk tolerance and a long-term horizon. The ""AI Power Rush"" is far from over, and in 2026, the winners will be those who can provide the most electrons in the shortest amount of time.

Investors should closely monitor monthly NRC filings for Oklo and quarterly backlog conversion rates for Bloom. In a world where ""compute is the new oil,"" these two companies are the new refineries. The transition to decentralized, high-density power is the defining investment theme of the decade, and the 2025 performance of BE and OKLO was merely the opening act.

The Pettit National Ice Center is an official training site for U.S. Speedskating.","The Pettit National Ice Center has made Milwaukee a destination for the Olympic speedskating world. Now, the first indoor speedskating oval built in the U.S. is going solar.

The arena contains enough ice to fill more than five National Hockey League rinks. Like most ice centers, it requires a significant amount of energy to keep its skating surface frozen and dry.

The solar project will cut the 200,000-square-foot facility’s energy use by at least 20 percent and power the building during summer months.

It’s funded by a large donation gifted to the nonprofit by the climate-focused VoLo Foundation.

Paul Golomski is the Pettit Ice Center’s general manager. He believes the project will help the facility use energy more responsibly.

“There’s only five (indoor speedskating ovals) in North America, and there’s only 40 operating in the entire world,” Golomski said. “So I think it’s a really smart thing for us to invest in and to ensure that we’re being responsible stewards of our energy consumption.”

He says over a 20-year period, the system will have the impact of reducing the center’s CO2 emissions by 12,778 tons. That’s equal to 191,000 trees planted, or 29,053,530 miles driven by cars.

Milwaukee-based renewable energy company Arch Solar is leading the project — a 690 kilowatt system consisting of 1,200 bifacial solar panels. This allows each panel to absorb sunlight from its front and back sides, producing more energy.

Andrew Holmstrom is the business development supervisor at Arch Solar. He said the panels will generate enough energy to power a string of Christmas lights from Milwaukee to North Carolina.

“It’s going to be a clean, green rooftop power plant,” Holmstrom said.

Holmstrom previously lived across the highway from the ice center.

“I’ve been able to skate on the ice there, run inside there, and so to be able to be a part of this project and kind of leave our fingerprint on the building, it means so much,” Holmstrom said.

Arch Solar has been on the roof since late November. They hope to have it ready by early April.

,Congress,2026-01-01 20:22:35+00:00,The Sun-Sentinel,Salter: Sen. Wicker chairs a vastly different SASC in a very different Congress than did Stennis,Not Available,,,,,https://www.tallahatchienews.ms/sen-wicker-chairs-vastly-different-sasc-very-different-congress-did-stennis-6956d76b51db6,"Two men, more than any others, shaped that reality: the late Democratic U.S. Sen. John C. Stennis and the current GOP U.S. Sen. Roger Wicker.
Both chaired the Senate Armed Services Committee (SASC).
Both left fingerprints all over Mississippi’s defense economy.
As Armed Services chairman, Wicker is not building entirely new federal cities, as Stennis once did.
Under Wicker, Mississippi installations have secured hundreds of millions of dollars in military construction, infrastructure resilience, and readiness upgrades.","Below is an opinion column by Sid Salter:

Columnist Sid Salter says in both eras, Mississippi benefited from a senator who understood defense not just as policy, but as economic reality.

Mississippi has enjoyed an outsized role in national defense for most of the modern era. From World War II airfields to Cold War shipyards to today’s cyber, space, and naval missions, the Magnolia State has long punched above its weight in the Pentagon’s ledger.

Two men, more than any others, shaped that reality: the late Democratic U.S. Sen. John C. Stennis and the current GOP U.S. Sen. Roger Wicker. Both chaired the Senate Armed Services Committee (SASC). Both left fingerprints all over Mississippi’s defense economy. But they did so in very different ways, in very different Washingtons, under vastly different political rules in a wildly different Congress.

The question Mississippi taxpayers ought to ask isn’t which man was “better,” but whether the state is faring about as well under Wicker as it did under Stennis—given the times and circumstances in which each man served.

John Stennis was a creature of the old Senate. He rose through seniority, mastered the committee system, and exercised power quietly. When Stennis spoke, people leaned in. When he nodded, budgets moved. He didn’t give fiery speeches. He didn’t chase headlines. He worked behind closed doors and let results speak for themselves.

Those results were substantial. During Stennis’ tenure—especially as Armed Services chairman from 1969 to 1981—Mississippi saw foundational federal investments that still anchor the state’s economy today. The Mississippi Test Facility, later renamed the John C. Stennis Space Center, was among the most significant federal construction projects in state history. Keesler Air Force Base, Columbus Air Force Base, Camp Shelby, the Seabee base in Gulfport, and the Meridian Naval Air Station all grew and stabilized during the Cold War years when defense dollars flowed freely.

That era favored big footprints: more troops, more ships, more bases. Mississippi benefited because Stennis sat at the choke point of authorization and appropriations in a Congress where committee chairmen were kings. If you were a Mississippi taxpayer, you were getting a solid return on your federal tax dollar — especially if you lived near a base or shipyard.

Roger Wicker operates in a different universe entirely.

Today’s Senate is fragmented. Power is shared among leadership, committees, factions, and cable news. No chairman can simply dictate outcomes. Every defense bill requires coalition-building, messaging, and annual survival. In that environment, Wicker’s style is necessarily more public, more strategic, and more overtly national in scope.

As Armed Services chairman, Wicker is not building entirely new federal cities, as Stennis once did. Instead, he is protecting, modernizing, and integrating Mississippi’s existing defense assets to align with 21st-century military priorities. Under Wicker, Mississippi installations have secured hundreds of millions of dollars in military construction, infrastructure resilience, and readiness upgrades.

Stennis Space Center has been reaffirmed not just as a NASA asset, but as a joint federal campus supporting naval, maritime, and research missions. Shipbuilding and naval systems on the Gulf Coast are tied directly to national priorities for submarines, destroyers, and special operations craft.

The money flows differently now. It’s less dramatic, more incremental. But it is also more targeted and, arguably, more durable.

Mississippi’s defense industries have also changed. Under Stennis, the focus was on heavy construction, manpower, and large platforms. Under Wicker, the emphasis is on advanced manufacturing, autonomous systems, cyber operations, and technologies — industries that may employ fewer people directly but generate higher-skill jobs and longer-term relevance.

Adjusted for inflation, politics, and the global threat environment, Mississippi has fared well under both SASC chairmen—though it looks different. Stennis delivered expansion. Wicker delivers sustainment and modernization. Stennis brought Mississippi into the big leagues of defense. Wicker is keeping it there while both the rules and the game itself change.

Wicker has challenged Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth over the recent alleged drug boat bombings off the coast of Venezuela – something Stennis did to Defense Secretary Melvin Laird after U.S. incursions into Cambodia in 1970.

What hasn’t changed is Mississippi’s dependence on strong representation at the Armed Services table. In both eras, the state benefited from a senator who understood defense not just as policy, but as economic reality.",https://www.tallahatchienews.ms/sites/default/files/styles/facebook_post/public/02-03-2021%20Sid%20Salter_117_1.jpg,N,,2026-01-01 16:12:39.261560

North Dakota has long been a top honey producer, churning out 40 million pounds every year and bringing in close to $67 million.

By late summer, they return to North Dakota to produce honey.
For environmentalists, just the threat of SAF-directed agriculture in places like North Dakota is a sobering thought, especially given what’s happened elsewhere.","The Millers are a family of beekeepers in Gackle, North Dakota, a tiny farming town about 70 miles east of Bismarck. It was five decades ago when they began their labors here amid the endless swaths of sweet clover, alfalfa and the variety of other plant life that bees thrive on.

North Dakota has long been a top honey producer, churning out 40 million pounds every year and bringing in close to $67 million. All of it courtesy of these undulating fields of wild grasses, and the buzzing insects who return to them each year.

“It was bee paradise,” said Jason Miller.

But not anymore. That paradise is slowly being transformed into a heaving ocean of corn and soybeans. Corn production in North Dakota alone has quadrupled to 16.5 million acres since the turn of the century, crowding out the diverse vegetation bees depend on.

Part of the reason has been the growing use of corn and soybean ethanol in biofuel, which mixes agricultural and waste feedstocks with fossil fuels for use in combustion engines. But more recently, it’s the promise of a newer biofuel that agricultural lobbyists and some environmentalists hope may someday supplant an intractable source of greenhouse gas emissions: jet fuel.

In 2021, President Joe Biden’s “Sustainable Airline Fuel Grand Challenge” turbocharged interest in jet biofuel, offering tax breaks to encourage production of 3 billion gallons of it by decade’s end. The aim was to help shrink the carbon footprint of air travel while locking in demand for US corn and soybeans, especially as the rise of electric vehicles shrinks traditional ethanol use in cars.

While the US Environmental Protection Agency is to evaluate all of the pathways for corn or soybeans to produce SAF, the agricultural industry and its lobbyists continue to prepare for what they hope

In the last year, US production capacity of SAF jumped from 5,000 to 30,000 barrels per day, according to government estimates, with much of the increase tied to new facilities coming online. And despite conflicting signals from the White House

According to his study, about 50% more cropland is needed for corn and soybeans to meet 2050 SAF production goals.

“The maximum amount of land that we’ve converted to cropland in a single year (roughly 1.8 million acres), would have to be quadrupled every year for the next 30 years,” said Limb.

And while collateral damage from efforts to slow global warming is not a new phenomenon, the expanded use of undeveloped land for biofuel-friendly monocultures and its destructive effect on bee populations could be especially significant for food production, the broader environment—and people like Jason Miller.

“We used to make 140 pounds of honey per beehive,” he said. But these days, Miller’s bee colonies appear to be weakening. This year, he averaged only 33 pounds.

The bees that once thrived in North Dakota and places like it are the backbone of a $400 million paid US pollination industry. Miller’s bees follow a pollination circuit in the spring, from almonds to apple and stone fruit orchards throughout the West. By late summer, they return to North Dakota to produce honey.

Honeybee populations already face a number of stressors—disease, pesticides and poor nutrition. Stressed bees are vulnerable to colony collapses: just one year ago US beekeepers lost more than half of their hives, according to an industry study. Katrina Klett, a doctoral student at the University of Minnesota who studies land use change and honeybee health, has seen up close the negative effects of grasslands giving way to corn.

“What I fear is that we’re not going to attach the environmental ethics to sustainable aviation fuel,” Klett said. “If we properly attach environmental metrics and outcomes to tax credit payments, we could move the needle to support farmers to adopt practices that increase diversity on the landscape.”

Without that added subsidy, it may be difficult for SAF to be cost-competitive with regular jet fuel. (The bill did, however, change how biofuel sustainability is calculated in a way that makes it easier for producers to qualify while still clearcutting forests or eliminating grasslands).

“Existing policy incentives make renewable diesel more profitable for most biofuel producers.”

There are other reasons SAF may still be too expensive to justify the investment. Jet fuel purity standards require complex processing and specialized equipment, and current feedstocks for SAF—including virgin vegetable oils—are typically more expensive than other biofuels. “Existing policy incentives make renewable diesel more profitable for most biofuel producers,” said Andrew Swanson, an agricultural economist at Montana State University.

Still, agricultural lobbies express eagerness when it comes to jet biofuel, given the effect EV use is having on corn and soybean ethanol markets. While pushing for a higher percentage of ethanol in gasoline blends used in land transportation, organizations such as the National Corn Growers Association and state-based trade groups are seeking more government incentives to use corn and soybeans for SAF.

For environmentalists, just the threat of SAF-directed agriculture in places like North Dakota is a sobering thought, especially given what’s happened elsewhere. A new study by researchers at the University of California, Davis, found biofuel demand drove the conversion of 1.7 million hectares of forest to oil palm production in Indonesia and Malaysia between 2002 and 2018.Turning wild grasslands into homogenous fields of corn and soybeans remains a “very real problem for biofuels,” said Jeremy Martin, director of fuels policy at the nonprofit Union of Concerned Scientists, in a Nov. 5 blog post. But there are other troubling consequences of the US biofuels push. Proposals for its production far exceed current domestic availability, meaning current mandates can only be met with imports and diverting vegetable oil from food to fuel, which will raise the cost of both while accelerating deforestation.

Swanson said the wild card in the SAF debate is trade, noting that

SAF advocates such as Veronica Bradley, director of environmental science for the industry lobby Clean Fuels Alliance America, counter that existing biofuel sources—used vegetable oil, beef tallow and forestry wastes—could satisfy near-term demand, as could shifting uses for corn ethanol amid the EV boom. For now, it appears the uncertainty over regulatory policies and incentives has put both the threat and promise of SAF, and in some respects the expanded use of biofuels in general, on hold.

“There is no real indication that we will move towards a clear, widely applicable standard for assessing land-use change and biodiversity impacts,” said Swanson. “This puts the SAF industry in a difficult position. Contradictory policy standards will mean that by catering to one market you are cutting off the opportunity to produce for a different market.”

how sustainable aviation fuel production could change the landscape,” she said, “unless we get the rules right.”

According to the European Commission, geothermal energy is a renewable energy source harnessed from the thermal energy stored in rocks and fluids deep within the Earth’s crust.
Unlike solar and wind that depend on the weather, geothermal power can run at all hours of the day, making it a highly attractive renewable energy source.
In May, the U.S. Department of the Interior announced plans to implement emergency permitting procedures to accelerate assessments of geothermal energy projects across the country, in line with President Trump’s energy agenda.
“Geothermal energy is a reliable energy source that can power critical infrastructure for national security and help advance energy independence,” Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said at the time.","Geothermal is one of the few renewable energy sectors that President Donald Trump has not tried to quash in favour of fossil fuels in the United States. There is significant promise for the future of geothermal power in the United States, even though most projects are still in the nascent stage of development. Both public and private funding are expected to bolster the sector in the coming years.

According to the European Commission, geothermal energy is a renewable energy source harnessed from the thermal energy stored in rocks and fluids deep within the Earth’s crust. Drilled wells connect the fluid to the earth’s surface, allowing it to be used for a range of purposes such as to generate electricity or provide direct heat for district heating, water heating or industrial processes.

Countries with easily accessible geothermal reserves have been harvesting power from these sources for centuries. Meanwhile, countries with harder-to-reach reserves can now use enhanced geothermal systems (EGS) to access vast, clean power sources. EGS is based on technology used in fracking operations, which emerged over the last century. Unlike solar and wind that depend on the weather, geothermal power can run at all hours of the day, making it a highly attractive renewable energy source.

In May, the U.S. Department of the Interior announced plans to implement emergency permitting procedures to accelerate assessments of geothermal energy projects across the country, in line with President Trump’s energy agenda. Projects selected for fast-tracking included three in Nevada, operated by Ormat, which received funding during President Trump’s first term in office in 2020. The move is expected to reduce approval times from months or even years to a maximum of just 28 days for energy or mining projects on federal lands that are deemed urgent.

“Geothermal energy is a reliable energy source that can power critical infrastructure for national security and help advance energy independence,” Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said at the time. “We’re fast-tracking reliable energy projects while strengthening national security and supporting American workers.”

In December, U.S. geothermal energy leader Fervo Energy announced it had raised $462 million in its Series E funding round to accelerate growth and support the ongoing construction of Cape Station and early development of several other projects. Cape Station in Utah is expected to deliver 100 MW of geothermal power to the grid starting in 2026, before expanding to 500 MW by 2028.

“Fervo is setting the pace for the next era of clean, affordable, and reliable power in the U.S.,” said Jeff Johnson, General Partner at B Capital. “With surging demand from AI and electrification, the grid urgently needs scalable, always-on solutions, and we believe enhanced geothermal energy is uniquely positioned to deliver.”

In New Haven, Connecticut, works have commenced on a geothermal energy network that will offer clean heating and cooling to the city’s Union Station and a new public housing development. It is the start of a project aimed at decarbonising all municipal buildings and transportation by the end of 2030.

“At the end of the day, you’re going to have the most efficient heating and cooling system available for our historic train station as well as roughly 1,000 units of housing,” said New Haven’s executive director of climate and sustainability, Steven Winter. ?“Anything we can help do to improve health outcomes and reduce climate change–causing emissions is really valuable.”

Nearby, at Yale University, development has started on a geothermal loop serving several science buildings. An energy bill that passed earlier this year and established a grant and loan programme is expected to spur the development of more thermal energy networks in the state.

However, it was in Framingham, Massachusetts, where the first utility-owned geothermal network in the United States came online in June 2024. In December, the Boston-based non-profit, the Home Energy Efficiency Team (HEET), announced that it had been awarded an $8.6 million grant by the U.S. Department of Energy’s Geothermal Technologies Office. The funding will contribute to the expansion of an existing networked geothermal system. HEET’s existing project provides clean heating and cooling to around 140 residential and commercial customers.

“This award is an opportunity and a responsibility to clearly demonstrate and quantify the growth potential of geothermal network technology,” said HEET’s Executive Director Zeyneb Magavi, “Which we will do, together with our partners and colleagues on the project team and at GTO. This project also represents the continuation of a collaboration that began when HEET first pitched our idea of geothermal networks to gas utilities in 2017.”

There are high hopes for the United States geothermal energy industry, particularly as it is continuing to garner federal support under the Trump administration. The expansion of geothermal power projects across the country are expected to support decarbonisation aims and help reduce reliance on fossil fuels in the coming years.

With a dismal political environment for Republicans, 2026 will prove to be a good year for Democrats in North Carolina.
The GOP Congress will continue to be inept and ineffective.
It’s a largely reactionary election and Democrats should avoid making it about big ideas that they lack the power to carry out.","Happy New Year and good riddance to 2025. What a nasty year it was. I hope 2026 brings a bit of relief, though I suspect it will bring additional frustrations.

The country enters its 250th year at odds with itself. The high ideals that Thomas Jefferson articulated and that representatives of the thirteen original colonies ratified in the Declaration of Independence are being trampled. Those high-minded men would be appalled at the grifter in the White House and depressed to know that so many Americans support him.

Last year, I didn’t make any predictions. Instead, I wrote a post about our broken political system. The closest I made to predictions were warnings. I wrote:

“As 2024 draws to a close, we’re about start a new cycle of Republican incompetence. The GOP controls Congress by an even narrower majority and Trump’s only clear agenda is self-enrichment for his family and friends. Without another election in the offing, Trump is tossing MAGA overboard and lining up with the billionaires as open warfare breaks out between the racist and grifter wings of the GOP. He’s suddenly pro-immigration as long as it’s the immigrants who benefit people like his new BFF, Elon Musk.

In Congress next week, Mike Johnson may have to fight to keep his role as House Speaker. Another ugly brawl could damage him more even if he keeps his seat and further expose the GOP’s weakness as a governing party. If they can’t govern with the White House and both Houses of Congress, they’re essentially an impotent party.

As for Democrats, they need to figure out to talk to Americans who work for wages again. They no longer have a large, enthusiastic base. Voters support them more as the lesser of evils because Democrats have failed to articulate a clear vision of what they stand for and have failed to communicate what they’ve accomplished.”

Trump’s second term was worse than I imagined. The speed with which he and his arsonists acted shocked Democrats and Republicans alike. The grifters moved in quickly, selling pardons and using foreign policy for business deals, enriching those around the president with little regard for the welfare of the country. Trump’s random and unorthodox use of tariffs rattled the world economy. The isolationists alienated all of our western allies, strengthening Russia and leaving Ukraine more vulnerable.

Elon Musk’s brief tenure as Secretary of Slash and Burn broke much of the federal government. The abrupt end of USAID costs the lives of thousands of children. The dismantling of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention brought back childhood diseases that were almost extinct. DOGE eliminated oversight that prevents fraud and protects Americans while keeping Musk’s government contracts intact. They are plundering the government.

Trump is building paramilitary units under the guise of immigration enforcement. He’s hired a group of thugs to snatch people off the street, out of their homes, and from their jobs to throw them in gulags. The goal is to create fear in communities and scare people into self-deportation. Civil and human rights be damned. Even if you believe we need to deport a lot of people, the methods used by these paramilitary units run contrary to the core values of our nation.

Finally, Trump is attempting to rebrand as much of the country with his name as possible. He’s renamed the Kennedy Center for himself. He’s also taken over municipal golf courses in Washington that he will likely name after himself. As we move toward the July 4th celebration, expect him to make more monuments to himself. He clearly sees the country as his.

That’s my wrap of 2025 at the national level. Now, for my predictions. In 2026, we’ll see a continuation of the worst of Trump’s abuses. He’ll escalate his deportation program and begin trying to strip citizenship away from naturalized citizens. The paramilitary squads will grow and become even more aggressive in their tactics, disappearing citizens and assaulting bystanders and witnesses.

The grift will continue. He’ll sell pardons to fraudsters and corrupt politicians, as long as they’re Republicans or politically pliable. The Trump Organization will see windfall profits as countries cut deals with the administration in exchange for enriching the Trump family and their associates. Republicans in Congress will continue to look the other way.

The economy will remain resilient, but prices will continue to increase, especially energy costs. “Affordability” will remain a catch phrase as people struggle to cover their costs even though unemployment stays relatively low.

Health care costs are going to increasingly dominate the political conversation. Premiums for people reliant on Obamacare are going to cause a lot of economic angst. My premium rose by almost 60%, costing me several thousands of dollars a year. Combined with looming cuts to Medicaid, health care costs are about to become a huge liability for Republicans.

Going into 2026, Republicans will suffer from the same economic problems that plagued Biden and the Democrats. The economy and jobs market will be relatively strong, but prices will leave voters feeling pinched. With control of the White House and Congress, the GOP will be at the receiving end of voters’ wrath this time.

Here in North Carolina, Republicans will suffer from the unpopularity of the Trump administration. Rising costs will leave voters in a foul mood. The legislature’s failure to pass a budget will leave rural communities that are disproportionately dependent on government jobs and money demoralized. They will feel the impact of teachers and state employees whose pay has stagnated as prices rise. Trickle down theory will take on a different meaning as the stores and businesses where they shop see their revenues drop, too.

With a dismal political environment for Republicans, 2026 will prove to be a good year for Democrats in North Carolina. Republican turnout will be down compared to 2022, the last midterm election. Anger at the Trump administration and dissatisfaction with the legislature will drive Democratic turnout higher than normal. Independent voters will break for Democrats.

The Republican primary for US Senate will expose the fighting playing out in the GOP right now. Much of MAGA will line up behind either Michele Morrow or one of the other Republicans running. Trump will come into the state to stump for Michael Whatley. He will prevail but the race will tighter than he wanted.

In the general election, Roy Cooper will maintain a significant lead throughout the year. The race will tighten in the fall but Whatley will never be able to catch the popular former governor. Whatley will be saddled with Trump’s unpopularity and the generally poor political environment. Cooper will win by six.

Senate President Pro-tem Phil Berger is going to lose his primary to Rockingham County Sheriff Sam Page. His loss will be a lesson about not knowing when to go. After his loss, Berger will resign his seat since trying to lead the Senate as a lame-duck would prove difficult with the jockeying among those who would succeed him. Berger and Thom Tillis, the two men who oversaw the 2010 GOP revolution in North Carolina, will exit the political stage at the same time.

In the legislature in general, Democrats will win enough seats in both chambers to sustain Governor Josh Stein’s veto, but will come up short of controlling either the state house or senate. It will give them more power to influence legislation than they have had in years. Stein will be more powerful heading into the second half of his term.

In the Supreme Court race, Justice Anita Earls will hold her seat, drafting off Cooper’s coattails and a favorable political environment for Democrats. The three Democrats running for Court of Appeals will also win.

Representative Don Davis will surprise people and win his seat despite the GOP gerrymandering. The political environment and Davis’ political savvy will pull him through.

In NC-11, Jamie Ager will give Chuck Edwards a fight. He’ll need a few breaks and a really good political environment to win, but Trump’s failures in western NC could be enough to get him over the top, especially if he can tie the lack of FEMA funds to Edwards’ lack of clout.

Republicans will face a tough election cycle in 2026. Donald Trump will remain unpopular. The GOP Congress will continue to be inept and ineffective. Prices on essential goods and services will continue to be high. GOP infighting will plague the party throughout the year, hampering turnout efforts and energy. Republicans will have little to motivate them to vote.

Democrats, for their part, need to beware of infighting. They need to avoid primaries that nominate candidates who do not fit districts or states. They should be reminded that Tea Party candidates in moderate states kept Republicans from controlling the US Senate until 2014 despite the wave in 2010.

This election is a referendum on the party in power. While Democrats should use the cycle to redefine themselves as more pragmatic, voters are thinking more about what the people in power have either offered them or done to them. It’s a largely reactionary election and Democrats should avoid making it about big ideas that they lack the power to carry out.

Dear New Yorkers,

Today is the beginning of a new era in New York City — one with enormous opportunities ahead. Five years since the worst of COVID, our city has come roaring back in countless ways, reasserting ourselves as a global cultural and economic powerhouse. We have defied the skeptics yet again.

But amidst the prosperity of this city — with a soaring stock market and gleaming new office towers — far too many New Yorkers are struggling. The cost of housing is now increasingly beyond the reach of even middle class families. Young people are finding it more and more difficult to break into the job market. Our homelessness crisis has reached painful, unprecedented heights, fueled in part by a broken mental health system.

Our city’s budget, now at over $116 billion, is projected to face multi-billion dollar deficits in the years ahead, even before factoring in the significant economic uncertainty we are facing. Meanwhile, amidst all these challenges, many New Yorkers have lost faith in local government, and are facing a federal government which is more likely to be hostile than helpful. The pressures we face are real and growing.

The Office of the New York City Comptroller will have a pivotal role to play in meeting the challenges of this moment.

The Comptroller is our city’s chief financial officer, our pension fiduciary, and responsible for providing accountability to every agency of City government. The office is critical to the fiscal and economic health of the city at any time. And at moments of great challenges such as this it plays a truly outsized role.

I will make tackling our housing affordability crisis my top priority, in part by investing some of our pension funds — in a prudent way that gets strong returns for retirees — to finance the creation of affordable housing throughout the five boroughs.

I will work to create innovative financing mechanisms to dramatically expand our city’s green infrastructure, so that we win the race to carbon neutrality.

I will fight for a budget which invests in tenant legal services, so that our city at last lives up to the commitments in our first-in-the-nation right to counsel law for those facing eviction. I will push for more funding for in-patient psychiatric services, to help get New Yorkers who are suffering off the street into the care they need and deserve.

And I will use the tools of audit and oversight to ensure that our City government works better — for regular New Yorkers, for small business owners, and for tax-payers. This will in part require pushing City agencies to embrace the technology of the modern era, so that we have a government freed of the worst limitations of bureaucracy. It will require a City government which is nimble enough to move fast during a period of accelerating change, and to capitalize on the promises of new technology while protecting against its perils.

This is not a short to-do list. But I firmly believe we can achieve these things together, and that New York City can be a more affordable, fairer, safer and prosperous city for all. I look forward to working every day, as your new comptroller, to make that a reality.

The administration justified its decision by citing risks to national security. These risks were allegedly identified by the Department of War, but it is unclear exactly what dangers are involved.

It is quite telling that Denmark used the same argument last year to block the construction of new wind farms. There, they feared the impact of wind farms on military radars, which have become particularly important due to the escalating situation between the EU and Russia. However, experts then found that the structures could simply be adjusted and there would be no communication problems. And the US knows this.

This makes the grounds for the suspension appear more than contrived, especially given the lack of new information from officials.

“This silence speaks volumes, especially given the president’s long and well-documented opposition to offshore wind energy,” CNN quotes a joint statement from Virginia Senators Mark Warner and Tim Kaine.

Criticism even from unlikely allies

Unexpectedly, this decision sparked criticism not only from proponents of clean energy, but also from representatives of the oil and gas industries. It turned out that these sectors had also invested significantly in offshore wind development.

“We urge the administration to end this pause and refrain from further actions that could harm jobs and investments,” said Erik Milito, President of the National Ocean Industries Association. “The U.S. needs a comprehensive energy strategy that covers all of the above, rather than a wholesale assault on renewable energy based on personal preference,” emphasized Liz Burdock, President and CEO of the Oceanic Network trade group.

Texas has emerged as a hotbed of green hydrogen activity in the US, supported in part by know-how borrowed from the oil and gas industry. Now another iconic fossil fuel state, Oklahoma, is jockeying for a piece of the action. A case in point is the Oklahoma City startup Tobe Energy, which has earned an investment from the home state fund Hurricane Ventures, along with a $1.8 million seed haul in September. So, what’s all the fuss about?

The Membrane-Free Green Hydrogen Solution

The main attraction is Tobe’s membrane-free electrolysis system for extracting hydrogen gas from water. Membrane-free is an atypical technology in the electrolysis circle, which is largely dependent on specialized membranes, so let’s take a brief look at the big picture.

Plain water could provide the hydrogen users of the world — of which there are many — with a more sustainable alternative to the standard method for procuring hydrogen, which involves squeezing it from natural gas or coal.

To date, investors and policy makers have focused on membrane-dependent electrolysis systems that push hydrogen gas from water with a catalyst and a jolt of electricity, ideally supplied by wind, solar, or other renewables. If that sounds costly, it is. A good deal of the expense comes from the membrane needed to keep the reaction moving (see more electrolysis background here).

Green hydrogen innovators around the world have been working on alternative membrane formulas and other system improvements to reduce the cost of electrolysis. Tobe is among the startups determined to skip to the head of the line by throwing out the membrane altogether, and starting from scratch (check out Tobe’s spec page here).

$1.8 Million For Membrane-Free Electrolysis

The University of Tulsa publicized the Hurricane Ventures commitment on December 26, noting that the two cofounders of Tobe Energy, Colby DeWeese and Caleb Lareau, are alumni of the school. “The funding will accelerate the company’s mission to make clean hydrogen production cheaper, more efficient and widely accessible to accelerate the transition to a low-carbon economy,” UT enthused.

“The company’s novel, membrane-free system simplifies the production process, cutting costs by up to 75% and reducing waste heat. This scalable technology is designed for large-scale use in industries like energy, manufacturing and transportation,” UT added. The transportation angle is somewhat at odds with the emerging consensus regarding the best-case economic scenarios for green hydrogen uptake. However, the manufacturing and energy use cases support a focus on on-site production for on-site or hyperlocal use, paring transportation and storage costs to the bone.

Hurricane Ventures also features in the $1.8 million round of seed funding spearheaded by Cortado Ventures in September. Cortado is keen on clean tech investing in the Mid-Continent region, which it defines as centered on Oklahoma and rippling into states at its borders including Texas as well as New Mexico, Colorado, Kansas, Missouri, and Arkansas.

That may seem somewhat counterintuitive considering that red-state politics dominate the region. However, as amply demonstrated in Texas, vote-getting rhetoric can only do so much against the inevitable march of the decarbonization movement (here’s another example).

“These states are historically the Country’s centers for major legacy industries such as energy, aerospace, manufacturing, healthcare, and agriculture. As more startups innovate within these verticals, founders familiar with them are gaining an edge,” Cortado explains.

Pushing Down The Cost Of Green Hydrogen, With LEDs

CleanTechnica caught up with Tobe Energy briefly last September, so now would be a good time to dig in and see what Cortado and other seed participants see in the startup. Along with several to-be-named angel investors, the list includes the Scissortail and Hurricane branches of 46 VC, Techstars, and former SpaceX engineer Jamie Gull’s Wavefunction VC.

Cortado announced the close of the seed round on September 4, taking note of co-founder DeWeese’s experience in oil, gas, and petrochemical systems management. “Before launching Tobe, DeWeese served as principal process engineer at Hydrogen Technologies, where he led the design and delivery of the first zero-emission hydrogen boiler of its kind,” Cortado noted.

As described by Cortado, capital costs for the system run approximately 75% less than conventional electrolyzers. The news organization Journal Record also posted a long form article on the topic on November 5, offering additional details. As described by JR reporter Chip Minty, the Tobe electrolysis system deploys LEDs (light emitting diodes) as an energy-saver. “LEDs pass electricity through semiconductor chips that generate almost no heat and require at least 75% less energy to operate,” Minty notes.

“All of these other electrolysis companies have this resistant element that’s just like a filament,” DeWeese told JR. “We’re doing it just like an LED, so the secret sauce is a unique configuration, certain voltages, certain frequencies. It’s what causes the water to split.”

The LED angle on electrolysis is new to the CleanTechnica radar, but the idea of membrane-free electrolysis is not. That comes under the heading of photoelectrochemistry. When dunked in water and exposed to light, a PEC (photoelectrochemical cell) can churn out hydrogen gas. The technology, also nicknamed “artificial leaf” is designed to mimic photosynthesis as closely as possible, without relying on external sources of electricity (see more artificial leaf background here).

And, here’s where an interesting coincidence comes into play — or not, as the case may be. In its September 4 announcement, Cortado credits DeWeese’s father with the invention of “the TiVo.” If they mean the digital recording device firm TiVo, that company was founded by Mike Ramsay and Jim Barton in 1997. If you can figure out where a Mr. DeWeese factors in, drop a note in the comment thread.

TiVO4, on the other hand, has been surfacing around the green hydrogen field of late. TiVO4 — titanium vanadium (not vibranium!) oxide — is an emerging semiconductor material that can be applied to photoelectrochemical cells (here’s a recent example). After the holidays I’ll reach out to Tobe to see if any additional clarification is available.

In the meantime, let’s keep an eye on Oklahoma. As with Texas, Oklahoma has two factors going for it: an abundance of legacy expertise from the oil and gas industry, along with a strong and growing renewable energy profile. The state’s solar industry has lagged behind wind power and further obstacles are looming, but the state’s Department of Commerce is determined to make the renewable energy case for attracting new businesses to the state.

Although a long fracking-related earthquakes have dominated the news from Oklahoma, as of December the ODC website noted that Oklahoma is #3 in a 50-state ranking for total renewable energy capacity including solar, hydro, geothermal, and bio-diesel along in addition to wind power. Overall, renewables account for 47% of its electricity generation in the state, and the ODC emphasizes that businesses in search of 100% renewable energy can get that, too (see our Oklahoma archive here).

Partisan politics notwithstanding, it sure looks like Oklahoma is poised to play a significant role in the US energy transition. If you have any thoughts about that, drop a note in the comment thread.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/tobe-energy-green-hydrogen.png,N,,2026-01-01 14:57:48.408426

December 22, 2025

Colorado River water could enable a pumped storage hydropower project intended to make the region’s electric grid more resilient.

KEY POINTS

One of the longest-duration pumped storage hydropower projects in the country is proposed for Navajo Nation land in the Four Corners region.

The project received a $7.1 million Department of Energy grant this year for feasibility studies.

Pumped storage hydropower is the largest form of energy storage in the U.S.

Standing in a breezy parking lot on Navajo land in the state’s far northwest corner, Tom Taylor looked toward the western horizon and then upwards at the furrowed mass of the Carrizo Mountains less than 10 miles away.

If all goes to plan, the infrastructure that could one day spill from the mountain’s flanks and through its core will become an essential piece of the region’s electric grid, able to store surplus electricity from renewable energy and other power sources for when it is needed later.

Fighting the wind that chilly November morning, Taylor used both hands to pin a detailed map against the hood of his Porsche Macan. A jumble of dashed lines and blue splotches representing proposed power lines, reservoirs, a water-supply pipeline, and access roads were printed atop the real-world geography on display in front of us.

“This will be a battery that lasts a long time,” Taylor said, holding tightly to the map.

The project is the $5 billion Carrizo Four Corners Pumped Storage Hydro Center, which is designed to be one of the largest long-duration energy storage projects in the country. Pumped storage moves water between two reservoirs at different elevations. Water is pumped uphill when excess electricity is available and released to generate electricity when power demand warrants it.

Taylor, a former mayor of Farmington and a state House representative from 2000 to 2014, is employed by Kinetic Power, the three-person, Santa Fe-based outfit behind the Carrizo proposal. The company sees the project as a way to make the region’s electric grid more durable and cost-effective, not only by smoothing the intermittent nature of wind and solar but also as a bulwark against energy emergencies like the winter storm in 2021 that caused blackouts and 246 deaths in Texas. The twinned reservoirs, using water sourced from a Colorado River tributary nearby, would have the capacity to generate 1,500 megawatts over 70 hours – a form of battery that could provide the equivalent output of a large nuclear plant for nearly three days.

“We believe that the key is delivering economic value,” said Thomas Conroy, Kinetic Power’s co-founder, who has four decades of experience developing energy projects.

What seems straightforward when placing lines on a map is much less so in three dimensions. Carrizo Four Corners, which is still in the exploratory stage and is at least five years away from breaking ground, has nearly as many questions as answers at this point. What is the geology within the Carrizo Mountains? Will it support a 3,300-foot-deep shaft, a subterranean powerhouse, and dam abutments? How will drought affect the water supply? What cultural sites and wildlife might be at risk from construction? What are the power market dynamics?

Answering those questions is the goal of a $7.1 million, two-and-a-half-year Department of Energy grant that Kinetic and its six university and research partners secured in August. (The state of New Mexico and the research partners are also contributing $7.1 million.) On the political side, will future Navajo administrations feel as favorably toward Carrizo as current president Buu Nygren?

The technical questions are but one piece of an ambitious project that touches many of the most pressing questions about natural resources in the American West today: energy development, water use, and the relationship between federal law and tribal law.

Connecting Water and Energy

Though the details are still to be worked out, the project can be described in broad strokes.

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which oversees federal hydropower licensing, granted Kinetic a preliminary permit in 2021. In February 2025 FERC extended the permit, which allows for site investigations but no construction work, for another four years.

The company envisions two “off-channel” reservoirs that would not dam a flowing river. The lower reservoir will be near Beclabito. The upper, in the high reaches of the Carrizo Mountains. Both are on Navajo land, but on different sides of the Arizona-New Mexico border.

The powerhouse that holds the electricity-generating turbines will be located underground, some 3,300 feet below the upper reservoir. Some of the longest pumped storage tunnels in the country will be required to connect the reservoirs and the powerhouse.

Despite the geotechnical challenges, Conroy is particularly enthused by the site, which he said is the most optimal in Arizona and New Mexico – and possibly the entire country – to locate a pumped storage hydropower project.

The site stands out for four reasons, he said. It is near existing transmission corridors and grid connections due to the region’s legacy of enormous coal-fired power plants. And it will have a comparatively low capital cost for the energy it will produce.

The other two reasons relate to water. Because of the extreme height differential between the upper and lower reservoirs – almost three Empire State Buildings – less water will be required to produce a unit of energy than for reservoirs with a gentler gradient. And because the upper reservoir site is a deep canyon, surface area and thus evaporation will be minimized.

“Water is just top of mind here in the Southwest,” Conroy said. “And our project is as water-efficient as can be made.”

Water to fill the reservoirs would be drawn from the San Juan River, a tributary of the Colorado, via pipeline. The water would come from the Navajo Nation’s San Juan rights, which have been quantified but are not fully used.

How much water? In its FERC permit application, Kinetic estimated that the initial fill, which will take one and a half to two years, would require 38,300 acre-feet. To cover subsequent evaporation losses, the reservoirs would need to be topped up with 2,635 acre-feet per year. Those numbers will be refined in the feasibility studies.

“It’s what, about 1,300 acres of corn?” Taylor said, doing a rough mental calculation of the equivalent water consumption for the annual evaporation loss. “I think this is more valuable than 1,300 acres of corn.”

Saving for Tomorrow

So far the project has threaded the federal government’s fraught energy politics. The Trump administration is hostile to wind and solar, which in their eyes reek of liberal values. Two water-based technologies – hydropower and geothermal – have escaped condemnation and are listed in the administration’s energy dominance documents. The DOE grant that Carrizo secured is a holdover from the Biden administration’s infrastructure bill, which provided up to $10 million for feasibility studies for pumped storage projects that would store renewable energy generated on tribal lands.

Storage is the holy grail of renewable energy. Human civilization has advanced, from the dawn of agriculture to the artificial intelligence revolution today, by being able to carry a surplus from one season and one year to the next. So it is with wind and solar. To maximize their utility and counteract their intermittent nature, engineers have been searching for cost-effective ways to store energy when the sun shines and when the wind blows for the days when neither of those things happen.

“If you want to improve the resiliency of the system, you either build more firm capacity instead of more renewable, or you build longer storage,” said Fengyu Wang, a New Mexico State University assistant professor who is the principal investigator for the DOE grant.

Storage has taken many forms. Some are fantastic mechanical configurations – lifting heavy objects and dropping them, or forcing air into caverns and releasing it. Thermal options use molten salt to trap the sun’s heat. The most familiar are batteries, which leverage chemical energy. But the most common, at least in the U.S., is pumped storage hydropower.

The 43 pumped storage facilities in the U.S. represent the bulk of the country’s utility-scale energy storage. They accounted for 88 percent of the total in 2024, according to Oak Ridge National Laboratory. That is changing quickly, however, as more battery storage comes online. The share for pumped storage was 96 percent in 2022.

Still, long-duration storage is where pumped storage shines. According to Oak Ridge, the median battery storage is two hours. For pumped storage, it is 12 hours. Longer duration provides more buffer, not only from day to day but also season to season.

In that regard, Carrizo would signify a huge leap. The only comparable pumped storage project under consideration in the U.S. is Cat Creek, in Idaho. Even though its duration is 121 hours, its generating capacity is less than half, at 720 megawatts.

Carrizo will have a different use case than other U.S. pumped storage projects, Conroy said. Many facilities have one customer and one generator. A nuclear plant, for instance, might be paired with a pumped storage system so that the nuclear plant can run continuously.

For Carrizo, there might be a consortium of utilities that have multiple generating sources feeding into this project and moving the water uphill. They would take delivery of that power across a large region with different climatic conditions and different needs for when and how they use the stored power. That means operating the facility will be more complicated than a traditional pumped storage project. One thing is certain, Conroy said: the Navajo will have an equity stake.

Tribal Outlook

Caution on the part of the Navajo would be understandable. The tribe’s lands have long been the center of energy developments with environmentally ruinous but economically helpful outcomes.

Uranium mining to fuel the Manhattan Project and then the nation’s reactors polluted rivers and groundwater, as did the coal mines that fed Four Corners Power Plant and the now-shuttered Navajo Generating Station and San Juan Generating Station. On the other hand, these developments provided employment and income. Navajo Mine, which supplies Four Corners Power Plant, accounts for about 35 percent of the Navajo Nation’s general fund.

Navajo and other tribal lands in the Four Corners region have been the target for a handful of pumped storage proposals in recent years. The Navajo Nation opposed three projects proposed for the Little Colorado River watershed, which were either withdrawn by the developer or denied a permit by FERC. Two other projects – Carrizo and Sweetwater, both using San Juan River water – are still in development. Sweetwater, a smaller project with eight hours duration, is being co-developed with the Ute Mountain Ute Tribe. A third project, Western Navajo Pumped Storage, which would be located near the former Navajo Generating Station, received a FERC preliminary permit in August.

Carrizo has not run into the same level of opposition as the other proposals. In part that is due to the proposed use of the San Juan River instead of groundwater, said Erika Pirotte, an assistant attorney general in the Navajo Nation’s water rights unit. Many Navajo communities rely on groundwater, and using it for pumped storage was viewed as unreasonable.

The lack of strong opposition is also because of Kinetic’s engagement with the Navajo Nation. The company has held meetings with the Beclabito, Red Valley, and Teec Nos Pos chapters, in addition to meetings with Navajo Nation agencies and Buu Nygren, the Navajo Nation president. Kinetic has a memorandum of understanding with Nygren, who also signed a letter of support for the project’s DOE grant application.

“We have the support of the council,” Conroy said. “We have a very high level of support from the president, and he is just extraordinarily interested in this project and seeing that it moves forward.”

From the Navajo perspective, what is interesting are the “ancillary benefits” that could come from the water supply pipeline, Pirotte said. Once the reservoirs are filled and the pipeline’s full capacity is not needed, the extra space could be repurposed for tribal water supply uses.

“That’s why the feasibility studies are really important for the Nation, because they help us understand to what extent Navajo Nation resources would be used for the project,” Pirotte said.

None of this is immediately around the corner, Conroy cautions. The DOE grant extends for more than two years. The FERC permitting process could be another two to four years. With Congress and the Trump administration talking about faster permitting and better coordination, that timeline is a best guess.

And then there is the question of tribal authority in the permitting process, not just for the Carrizo project but for other such developments. Will FERC abide by its 2024 stance that preliminary permits for hydropower projects on tribal lands require tribal consent? The Trump administration would like to see that policy scrapped. If FERC approves a project must a tribe assent to all the associated infrastructure? Will the Navajo be allowed to conduct reviews and issue permits?

And then there is construction, the biggest component. That will take four to six years, Conroy said.

Even on an ambitious timeline, Carrizo is not operating until the mid-2030s.

“I’m 77,” Taylor said. “I probably won’t see it.”

From the United States to Australia, renewable energy production is on the rise. One nation that has seen a substantial increase in not only the use of solar power, but also the complicated manufacturing of the panels is India. The iconic Asian nation has for generations been subject to relying on imports of energy resources from the likes of China, which leads the world in solar power component manufacturing; however, with a June 2026 mandate in place, India’s solar manufacturing sector is on the rise.

India’s solar module manufacturing capacity reached new heights in 2025

India’s population is vast, so big in fact that the nation has unwittingly become one of the largest by population density in the world. And those billion or so people need electricity, not just for everyday life, but to drive economic expansion and propel the nation forward. This year, the Indian government has decided to implement a mandate requiring domestic energy projects that use solar power to source their components from local manufacturers.

Wood Mackenzie noted that in 2025, India was on track to surpass 125 GW of domestic solar component manufacturing, which would be approximately triple the domestic market demand of around 40 GW. This astonishing capacity surge is representative of India’s Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme, which has catapulted the nation to compete with the bigger, more influential solar power manufacturing nations.

India may be faced with a challenge to align solar supply with domestic and international demand

While the surge in solar manufacturing is commendable, it may lead to a few challenges for the Indian solar market. The sector will need to contemplate the possibility of not being able to efficiently supply the domestic market due to overcapacity strangling the price for solar power, much like what has occurred in China recently, as noted by Wood Mackenzie.

“India’s government’s PLI scheme has been highly effective in spurring factory announcements, but the industry is now seeing warning signs of rapid overcapacity similar to those that preceded China’s recent price collapse. The challenge has shifted from building capacity to achieving cost-competitiveness and diversifying export markets.” – Yana Hryshko, Head of Solar Supply Chain Research at Wood Mackenzie

India’s Goldi Solar just secured a substantial investment in its solar portfolio

The Indian solar firm recently secured a $171 million investment from serious heavyweight backers, including Havells India, to boost solar power component manufacturing even further than the current levels. This significant investment is one of the largest made by a single company in India’s solar sector and exemplifies the surge of the sector in the nation.

The Indian government has outlined plans to increase non-fossil power generation from the current levels of 186 gigawatts to an astonishing 500 gigawatts. By June of this year, any public projects must source locally manufactured solar power components, marking a milestone in India’s renewable energy dream. With new entries into the global solar market becoming the norm, India is leading the solar-powered charge into the future.

India’s billion-dollar bet on its solar industry is producing results

India’s astonishing surge in solar manufacturing has been a sight for sore eyes in a nation that requires substantial amounts of energy just to keep the population at bay, which most of the time is a challenge on its own. With Rajasthan launching the nation’s first solar park integrated with battery storage, the sentiment over the renewable energy sector in India has never been clearer. The future of the Indian energy sector will be driven forward by the unstoppable force of the solar power industry.",https://energiesmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Depositphotos_676327874_XL-1.jpg,N,,2026-01-01 17:57:29.799301
,EPA,2026-01-01 18:07:16+00:00,Lake Placid News,Four green groups seeking to join howitzer hearing - Lake Placid News,Not Available,,,,,https://www.lakeplacidnews.com/news/local-news/2026/01/01/four-green-groups-seeking-to-join-howitzer-hearing/,"While the public can watch the hearing, only those with party status can actively participate in it.
The deadline to file intervenor petitions — where groups without original party status are subsequently granted it, provided they meet the relevant criteria — was Dec. 19.
One of the project sponsor’s attorneys and authorized representatives, Matthew D. Norfolk, said he would “likely oppose” all of the green groups seeking to join the hearing.
The ALJ’s decision concerning party status, once rendered, can be appealed to the APA at a future meeting.
The green groups had both overlapping and unique reasons for seeking party status, as stated in their individual petitions.","While the public can watch the hearing, only those with party status can actively participate in it. This includes presenting evidence and testimony from experts, as well as cross-examining those of other parties. The four green groups — Adirondack Council, Adirondack Wild: Friends of the Forest Preserve, Protect the Adirondacks! and the Sierra Club’s Atlantic Chapter, which includes the entirety of New York state — are all opposed to the howitzer range. There are no other groups that filed petitions.

The only listed parties, so far, are those that had original status as parties of right: the Adirondack Park Agency, the project sponsor and the administrative law judge (ALJ) presiding over the hearing. The deadline to file intervenor petitions — where groups without original party status are subsequently granted it, provided they meet the relevant criteria — was Dec. 19.

State procedures that govern the APA’s adjudicatory law hearings require the hearing officer, ALJ David N. Greenwood, to make a decision approving or denying the petitions within five business days of the deadline, or ask for more information. In that case, the ruling would be within five business days of the deadline for that additional information.

On Monday, Greenwood wrote to the four green groups seeking party status, as well as the two other original parties, informing them that he would be asking for more information, stating that the applicable state regulations afford other parties “to be heard” as part of the consideration process for potentially granting prospective intervenors’ party status — and he wanted to allow time for that in advance of his ruling, especially given the current timing around the holidays.

One of the project sponsor’s attorneys and authorized representatives, Matthew D. Norfolk, said he would “likely oppose” all of the green groups seeking to join the hearing.

Greenwood asked the current and prospective parties to submit any comments or opposition to the petitions for party status by 5 p.m. on Tuesday, Jan. 6. From there, he wrote that he hoped to issue rulings granting or denying the petitions five business days after that, or Tuesday, Jan. 13. It’s possible, though, that further delays could arise.

In granting a petition, Greenwood could limit the scope in which a certain party can participate. The ALJ’s decision concerning party status, once rendered, can be appealed to the APA at a future meeting.

The green groups had both overlapping and unique reasons for seeking party status, as stated in their individual petitions. The four groups all cited memberships that both reside in and visit the Adirondacks, and would be adversely impacted by the firing of a howitzer artillery cannon. They all point to demonstrated and extensive previous engagement with the APA on land use matters in the Adirondacks, including participation in the last adjudicatory hearing for the proposed Adirondack Club and Resort in Tupper Lake, held in 2011.

–

Adirondack Council

–

The Adirondack Council is represented by the Albany-based law firm Whiteman Osterman & Hanna LLP. One of its three attorneys on the case is Paul Van Cott, of Saranac Lake. He joined the firm in 2019 in an “of counsel” capacity after retiring as an APA attorney, having been with the agency for around 20 years.

In its petition, the Adirondack Council noted that the howitzer range proposal “is unprecedented in the history of the Adirondack Park,” and needs to be treated as such. The Adirondack Council cited 31 past examples of land use matters it has participated in as evidence of its ability to meaningfully and substantively engage in the proceeding.

“The proposed testing of military-grade weapons on the Project Site represents a use that is fundamentally different in character and intensity from activities traditionally permitted in the Adirondack Park, requiring careful expert planning and technical evaluation and analysis of the Applicant’s proposal,” the petition states.

Given how novel the proposal is, the petition further states that if it’s approved, it could set a precedent for similar projects throughout the park, including potential future expansions in weapons testing at the proposed site.

The Adirondack Council highlighted what it views as several deficiencies with the sound analysis that the project sponsor, Michael C. Hopmeier of Unconventional Concepts, Inc., presented as part of his application.

“The Applicant’s analysis relies on a(n approximately) 20-year-old Norwegian Defence Research Establishment (NDRE) study, with unclear landscape and environmental conditions (temperature, vegetation, wind, ambient noise, humidity, device range) — factors that meaningfully affect sound propagation,” the petition states. “Despite these unknowns, the Applicant modeled source levels using a 130.5 dB measurement from the NDRE study to calculate a modeled source level of 180.8 dB for an M109 155 mm howitzer. However, source-to-receiver distances in the NDRE study differ from the (approximately) 675-foot distance between the proposed barrel assembly and target area here, undermining comparability.”

The Adirondack Council also pointed out that field measurements were taken in two days, one day apart, in late December, and if the testing were to take place in warmer months, as the proposal allows the option of, it could have a different noise dispersion effect.

The group also said the study has gaps in peak sound levels for the howitzer that warrant further independent review, and claimed that it failed to take into consideration the cumulative noise effects from a nearby mine, which, if the two sites were to be in operation simultaneously, the Adirondack Council said could have a greater negative ecological and human impact than what’s been modeled for.

The Adirondack Council’s petition did not name any specific witnesses, stating that it was still reviewing application materials and was in the process of identifying qualified experts for testimony.

–

Adirondack Wild: Friends of the Forest Preserve

–

Adirondack Wild dedicated much of its petition to contending that the proposed howitzer testing range, even though it’s on private land, is inconsistent with its zoning classification as “rural use.” The group noted that it submits monthly verbal public comments to the APA, and regularly submits written comments about new land use and development applications on rural-use land.

“Military-style testing of cannons exhibiting sound forces at or exceeding 100 dbA should not be deemed compatible with the stated legislated purposes, policies and objectives or Rural Use,” the petition states. “The (state) legislature was clear about this. Military-style weapons testing is not listed as either a primary or secondary use, meaning it is presumed incompatible in this land use classification.”

Adirondack Wild also took issue with the project being of commercial use, stating it appears to lack a military or commercial sponsor or purpose. It also raised concerns about nearby Forest Preserve land, which, at its closest point, is about 554 feet from the proposed range.

“The military-style testing will introduce new, potentially damaging noise forces within these public wildlands, thus directly affecting our environmental interests,” the petition states.

The petition did not, at this time, name any specific witnesses or evidence it would seek to introduce at the hearing.

–

Protect the Adirondacks!

–

Protect! detailed its history of participation in land use matters before the APA as a demonstration of its capability to meaningfully participate in the hearing, and stated that it would submit testimony on each of the three issues the adjudicatory hearing seeks to address: the project’s compatibility with the Adirondack Park, compatibility with rural use-zoned land and whether it would produce any undue adverse impacts on the resources of the Park.

Protect! included several witnesses in its petition, with the request that the list may be supplemented or modified as the hearing progresses, should the group be granted party status.

“Protect! intends to provide expert testimony regarding the history and characteristics of the Adirondack Park generally, why the proposed Project conflicts with the purposes and policies of the APA Act and whether the howitzer firing range is compatible with the purpose of insuring overall conservation, protection, preservation, development and use of the unique scenic, wildlife, recreational, open space, ecological and natural resources of the Adirondack Park,” the petition states.

Potential witnesses Protect! said it would call include Philip Terrie, Ph.D., one or more retired U.S. military personnel who Proect! said might focus on “alternatives to the proposed project” and former APA Associate Counsel Barbara Rottier, who Protect! said would testify on why the project is inconsistent with rural use-zoned land characteristics and commercial use issues.

Protect! also said it intends to call Kurt Fristrup, Ph.D., on how the proposed project’s noise could pose adverse ecological effects to nearby Forest Preserve land. The group also intends to present testimony from multiple witnesses in the town of Lewis regarding the “characteristics and community character of the area.”

In its petition, Protect! includes several other witnesses who would cumulatively testify on five of the eight sub-issues raised in the undue adverse environmental impact study.

–

Sierra Club Atlantic Chapter

–

The Sierra Club noted that it has 37,000 members in its Atlantic Chapter and, if granted party status, would be represented by Pace University’s Environmental Litigation Clinic. It pointed to the chapter’s past engagement with the APA’s land classification input, public hearings and public comment periods, specifically in relation to a state proposal to build a maximum security prison in Tupper Lake in the late 1990s, the Adirondack Club and Resort adjudicatory hearing, the land classification processes around Little Tupper Lake in Hamilton County and the Boreas Pond Tract in Essex County.

The petition states the Sierra Club Atlantic Chapter would present written testimony pertaining to whether its compatible with the rural use land classification and whether there would be an undue ecological impact or disruption to native or migrating wildlife and their habitats.

“The Sierra Club has both social and environmental interests which are likely to be affected by the agency decision concerning the project,” the petition states. “Sierra Club members who hike, hunt or birdwatch in the (area) will be deterred from doing so by the disruption of solitude caused by the howitzer blasts, and the disruption of opportunities to observe wildlife caused by the howitzer blast and by the potential decline in wild bird populations and breeding disruption caused by the howitzer blasts.”

Paws need claws: Declawing a cat in California is now illegal unless the surgery is medically necessary.","Gov. Gavin Newsom’s office this week described 2025 as “the year that would not end.” But it has, and in its aftermath comes a slew of new laws passed that year that will affect the lives of almost every Californian.

The governor signed nearly 800 bills last year, including legislation that caps the cost of insulin, streamlines California State University admissions and temporarily allows sexual assault claims that are past the statute of limitations. He also approved legislation banning law enforcement officers from wearing masks to hide their identities during operations — a law that’s already being challenged in court by the Trump administration.

Some of the new state laws were passed years ago and are just now taking effect.

“These new laws reflect who we are: a state that protects workers, respects students, puts people before politics, and isn’t afraid to hold powerful interests accountable,” Newsom said in a Tuesday statement.

Most of the laws listed below take effect on New Year’s Day. As in years past, the list mostly reflects the interests of the Democrats who hold a supermajority in both the state Senate and Assembly and hold every statewide office in California, including the governorship.

Here are a few notable laws going into effect:

Health

Fertility treatments: Large employer health plans will be required to cover infertility treatments, including in vitro fertilization, for everyone, regardless of marital status, gender identity or sexual orientation. “California is a proud reproductive freedom state — and that includes increasing access to fertility services that help those who want to start a family,” Newsom said after signing the bill in 2024. The governor later pushed to delay implementation of state Senate Bill 729 until 2026. IVF costs Californians an average of $24,000 out of pocket, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

Cheaper insulin: Large group health plans must cap the out-of-pocket costs for insulin at $35 for a 30-day supply under SB 40. Roughly 3.5 million adults have diagnosed diabetes in California, according to the American Diabetes Assn. “Many Americans with diabetes have made the difficult decision to ration this lifesaving medication to pay for other necessities, such as groceries or rent,” said Christine Fallabel, the association’s state government affairs director, in a news release. “This legislation will provide much-needed financial relief.” California will also start selling $11 insulin pens through the state’s prescription program, CalRx, on Jan. 1.

Privacy for providers: Healthcare providers and employees affiliated with gender-affirming services can have their residential addresses withheld from certain public record requests. Assembly Bill 82 allows these providers to submit applications for increased privacy to the California secretary of state if they are experiencing harassment or violent threats due to the nature of their work. California already allows those working in reproductive healthcare to apply.

Protection for immigrants: Healthcare officials are prohibited from disclosing a patient’s immigration status or birthplace and from giving immigration authorities access to nonpublic spaces in hospitals and clinics without a search warrant or court order. The protections under SB 81 are among new laws to protect immigrants in California, Newsom said, from the “secret police” of President Trump and Stephen Miller, the White House advisor who has driven the second Trump administration’s surge of immigration enforcement in Democratic-led cities.

Law enforcement and legal rights

Mask ban: Law enforcement officers must visibly display their name or badge number during operations and are also banned from wearing masks that conceal their identities while on duty, with some exceptions. SB 805 and SB 627 were introduced in response to the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration raids in Southern California, which in many cases were conducted by masked agents in unmarked cars. Newsom has said it’s unacceptable for “secret police” to grab people off the streets. The U.S. Department of Justice is suing California over the new laws, arguing both are unconstitutional and could put officers in danger.

Sexual assault reporting: A two-year window is opening to report sexual assault claims — cases that previously would have been barred because of the statute of limitations — against private employers or institutions that engaged in a “cover-up.” The time frame starts Jan. 1 and expires Dec. 31, 2027. AB 250 applies to those who were assaulted after age 18. The state already created an extension for child sexual assault victims in 2020. “AB 250 gives those who’ve been silenced by intimidation, shame, or institutional cover-ups another shot at justice, because survivors deserve to be heard, believed, and supported,” Assembly Majority Leader Cecilia M. Aguiar-Curry (D-Winters) said in October.

Amicable divorce: California couples seeking an amicable dissolution of their marriage will now have an easier, less costly way to go their separate ways. Under SB 1427, which passed in 2024, couples will be allowed to file a joint petition for dissolution of their marriage or legal separation. Until now, filing a joint petition was permitted only in limited circumstances, including when the couple had been married for fewer than five years and where their community property assets were worth less than $25,000. In all other cases, the couple had to navigate a more onerous legal process.

Consumer protections and laws

Buh-bye plastic bags: Plastic bags at grocery store checkout stands are banned under a law that was passed in 2024. Stores can offer recycled paper bags or customers can bring in their own bags. The change under SB 1053 comes almost a decade after California voters passed a statewide ballot measure that banned single-use plastic bags at grocery store checkouts. At many stores, those were replaced with thicker plastic carryout bags that were considered reusable and could be recycled. But in reality, many customers used them just once and tossed them.

Food delivery: Food delivery services including Uber Eats, DoorDash and Postmates will be required to provide a full refund to customers if their order is not delivered, or if the wrong order is delivered. Under AB 578, food delivery services also must provide customer service support, staffed by actual people, to help resolve requests for refunds.

Rental car estimates: Rental car companies will be required to provide customers with a good-faith estimate of the total charges, including taxes and fees, when providing a price quote for a reservation. Under AB 1374, the companies also must disclose whether the vehicles are gas-powered or electric or use another fuel source.

Volume control: Video streaming services under SB 576 will be prohibited from airing advertisements that are louder than the shows or other video content they are providing. Federal law already bans that practice on broadcast stations and cable channels.

Overdraft fees: State-chartered credit unions are prohibited from charging overdraft fees exceeding $14 or the amount set by the federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, whichever is lower. SB 1075 was passed and signed into law in 2024.

Business, workers and technology

Minimum wage increase: The state minimum wage increases from $16.50 to $16.90 on Jan. 1. Some counties and cities, including Los Angeles, already have higher local minimum wage requirements. Workers paid less than minimum wage can file a wage theft claim with the California labor commissioner’s office. The state’s labor laws apply to workers regardless of immigration status.

New state holiday: Diwali, also known as the “Festival of Lights,” has been added to California’s official list of statewide holidays. This means public schools can close and state employees can elect to take the day off. Diwali typically occurs in late October or early November and is celebrated by members of the Hindu, Sikh and Jain faiths. It symbolizes the victory of light over darkness. AB 268 makes California the third state to recognize the holiday, following Pennsylvania and Connecticut.

Deleting social media: Major social media platforms are required to provide users with a button in the account settings that allows them to delete their account — and make that button accessible on any format used to access the platform, including cellphones, computers and tablets. AB 656, passed in 2025, also requires social media platforms to delete the personal information in a user’s account when they cancel.

Protecting kids from AI: Artificial intelligence companies are required to notify users younger than 18 at least every three hours to take a break and that the chatbot is not human. They are also required to implement “reasonable measures” to prevent companion chatbots from generating sexually explicit content. SB 243 was enacted to prevent the production of suicide or self-harm content and put in protections, such as referring users to a suicide hotline or crisis text line.

AI and public safety: Large artificial intelligence companies will be required to publicly disclose their security protocols and reports of critical safety incidents. SB 53 will require companies to disclose their safety and security protocols and risk evaluations. It mandates reporting of critical incidents — such as cyberattacks or unsafe behavior by autonomous AI systems — to the state’s Office of Emergency Services. Violations of the new law can bring civil penalties of up to $1 million against companies.

Less red tape for restaurants: The approval process for independent restaurants that want to retrofit spaces is being streamlined under AB 671. “For too long, opening a restaurant in California has meant endless hurdles and frustrating delays,” said the bill’s author, Assemblymember Buffy Wicks (D-Oakland), in October. “We’re making it easier for small restaurateurs to turn their ideas into reality.”

Lyft and Uber drivers can unionize: Hundreds of thousands of ride-hail drivers can unionize and bargain collectively while still being classified as independent contractors. Wicks, who co-authored AB 1340 with Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Menlo Park), previously said this will allow drivers to ”bargain for better pay and protections, and help build a future where the gig economy works for the people behind the wheel.” The law was a compromise between labor groups and Silicon Valley gig economy companies.

More oil: Oil production can ramp up in Central California. SB 237 will allow up to 2,000 new wells annually in Kern County, effective through 2036. The law, which drew ire from environmentalists, is intended to prevent a spike in gas prices amid refinery closures.

Education

Direct admissions: Public high school students who meet the California State University’s minimum eligibility requirements will be automatically admitted and able to enroll at one of 16 CSU campuses. SB 640 is intended to encourage students who are unsure about college to attend. “Being able to get that message that says, ‘Hey, you’re admitted, and you just need to submit some paperwork,’ I think it’s going to be a big boost for a lot of students,” Adrian Huerta, an associate professor and college access scholar at the USC Rossier School of Education, has said.

Gender-neutral bathrooms: All public schools in California will be required to provide at least one all-gender bathroom starting July 1. The legislation expands a decade-old law that requires K-12 schools to allow students to use the bathroom that aligns with their gender identity. SB 760 was passed in 2023. “These measures will help protect vulnerable youth, promote acceptance and create more supportive environments in our schools and communities,” Newsom said in a statement when he signed the bill.

Cellphones in classrooms: Public schools are required to adopt a policy by July 1 to prohibit or limit the use of smartphones by students when they are on campus. AB 3216 leaves it up to local K-12 schools whether students should be banned from using cellphones altogether. But the law requires public schools to restrict phone use in order to “support pupil learning and well-being.”

Immigration raids: Federal immigration agents are barred from nonpublic areas of public schools unless they have a judicial warrant or court order. Under AB 49, school districts also are prohibited from providing information about pupils, their families, teachers and school employees to immigration authorities without a warrant. SB 98 also requires school administrators to notify families and students if federal agents conduct immigration operations on a K-12 or college campus.

Antisemitism: A state Office for Civil Rights will be created to combat antisemitism and other forms of discrimination in California schools. AB 715 was among the most hotly contested education-related measures, spawning from dissatisfaction, largely among a coalition of Jewish groups, with the way ethnic studies have been taught in some California classrooms. On Wednesday, a federal judge in San José rejected a lawsuit filed by the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee on behalf of a group of educators and students, who challenged the law, clearing AB 715 to take effect.

Animals

Official snake: The giant garter snake is recognized as the official snake of California. Advocates hope this recognition from SB 765 will raise awareness about the threatened species, which is found in the Central Valley and has experienced large-scale habitat destruction due to urban and agricultural development.

Paws need claws: Declawing a cat in California is now illegal unless the surgery is medically necessary. AB 867 bans the procedure, which entails amputating the first bone in each of a feline’s toes or severing the tendons. Assemblymember Alex Lee (D-San José), the bill’s author, previously called the practice “barbaric” and inhumane.

Housing

Faster construction: Various infrastructure projects are now exempt from the California Environmental Quality Act’s lengthy review process. This reversal from AB 130 and SB 131 has outraged environmentalists, who say it removes crucial protections for the state’s most vulnerable wildlife and communities. Proponents of the legislation argue construction must be faster and cheaper to address the state’s housing crisis.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/aa1a592/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2878x1511+0+745/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F69%2Fdc%2F19c5c410422cb9e78a61e8ad9a12%2Fnew-laws-in-2026.jpg,N,,2026-01-01 12:57:47.113113
,North Carolina American Energy ,2026-01-01 16:56:23+00:00,markets.financialcontent.com,The Functional Frontier: How Celsius Holdings Redefined the Energy Market in 2025,Not Available,,,,,https://markets.financialcontent.com/wral/article/marketminute-2026-1-1-the-functional-frontier-how-celsius-holdings-redefined-the-energy-market-in-2025,"By the close of 2025, Celsius and its newly integrated brands commanded nearly 17% of the U.S. energy drink market, solidifying its position as the undisputed third-largest player in the category.
By the third quarter of 2025, Celsius reported a 55% year-over-year revenue increase, with the stock price recovering over 110% from its 2024 lows to trade in the $46–$48 range.
Throughout 2025, Celsius successfully executed rollouts in the United Kingdom, France, and Australia.
By the end of 2025, international revenue reached an annualized run rate of $100 million, proving that the brand's ""functional"" appeal transcends North American borders.
While still the volume leaders, both lost market share in 2025 as consumers traded ""extreme"" energy for the ""clean"" energy marketed by Celsius and Alani Nu.","As of January 1, 2026, the energy drink landscape has undergone a seismic shift, moving away from the high-octane, extreme-sports branding of the early 2000s toward a ""Better-For-You"" (BFY) functional era. At the center of this transformation is Celsius Holdings (Nasdaq: CELH), which has officially transitioned from a high-growth disruptor into a diversified beverage titan. After a turbulent 2024 marked by inventory corrections and a cooling U.S. consumer market, Celsius spent 2025 orchestrating one of the most successful strategic pivots in the industry, punctuated by the landmark acquisition of Alani Nu.

The implications for the broader market are profound. Celsius, alongside its distribution partner PepsiCo (Nasdaq: PEP), has successfully bridged the gap between fitness enthusiasts and everyday consumers. By the close of 2025, Celsius and its newly integrated brands commanded nearly 17% of the U.S. energy drink market, solidifying its position as the undisputed third-largest player in the category. For investors and competitors alike, the ""Celsius Playbook"" has become the new standard for scaling a lifestyle brand in an increasingly health-conscious world.

From Volatility to Dominance: The 2024-2025 Turnaround

The journey to the top was far from linear. In mid-2024, Celsius faced its first major crisis of confidence since its meteoric rise. Shares of Celsius Holdings (Nasdaq: CELH), which had peaked near $100 in early 2024, plummeted to the mid-$20s by the end of that year. The primary catalyst was a massive ""destocking"" event by PepsiCo, which reduced its inventory of Celsius products by over $100 million to optimize working capital. This created a significant timing mismatch, where the company reported lackluster shipment growth even as retail sales velocity remained high.

However, 2025 served as a year of aggressive redemption. In April 2025, Celsius announced the $1.8 billion acquisition of Alani Nu, a brand that had built a cult-like following among female consumers and the fitness community. This move did more than just add volume; it diversified Celsius’s demographic reach and provided a buffer against the slowing growth of its core product line. By the third quarter of 2025, Celsius reported a 55% year-over-year revenue increase, with the stock price recovering over 110% from its 2024 lows to trade in the $46–$48 range.

The international front also provided a significant tailwind. Throughout 2025, Celsius successfully executed rollouts in the United Kingdom, France, and Australia. In the UK, a partnership with Suntory Beverage & Food (TYO: 2587) placed Celsius on the shelves of major retailers like Morrisons, while in France, the brand achieved 88% grocery penetration through deals with Carrefour and E.Leclerc. By the end of 2025, international revenue reached an annualized run rate of $100 million, proving that the brand's ""functional"" appeal transcends North American borders.

Winners and Losers in the New Energy Order

The rise of functional beverages has created a clear divide in the market. The primary winners are those who have leaned into the ""lifestyle"" segment. Keurig Dr Pepper (Nasdaq: KDP) emerged as a formidable challenger by taking a majority stake in Ghost Energy in late 2024. Throughout 2025, Ghost saw growth rates exceeding 20%, leveraging authentic collaborations with brands like Warheads and Sour Patch Kids to dominate the gaming and Gen Z demographics. Similarly, ZOA Energy, backed by Molson Coors (NYSE: TAP), successfully pivoted toward an ""everyday electrolyte"" focus, seeing double-digit sales growth in late 2025.

Conversely, the year 2025 was a period of reckoning for ""hype-driven"" brands. Prime Energy, the influencer-led brand by Logan Paul and KSI, suffered a dramatic collapse, with sales falling as much as 70% in certain regions. The brand was plagued by litigation, including a $68 million supplier lawsuit and regulatory scrutiny over its caffeine content. The legacy giants, Monster Beverage Corp (Nasdaq: MNST) and Red Bull, also faced headwinds. While still the volume leaders, both lost market share in 2025 as consumers traded ""extreme"" energy for the ""clean"" energy marketed by Celsius and Alani Nu. Monster, in particular, struggled to find significant traction with its alcohol-infused ""Beast Unleashed"" line, which failed to offset the slowing growth of its core energy portfolio.

The Regulatory Squeeze and the Functional Pivot

The wider significance of Celsius’s performance lies in its alignment with broader industry trends and shifting regulatory landscapes. As 2025 drew to a close, the energy drink sector faced unprecedented pressure from global health authorities. In the UK, the government moved to ban the sale of high-caffeine energy drinks to children under 16, a move that forced many brands to reformulate or lose significant convenience store access. In the U.S., the introduction of the ""Caffeine Safety Bill"" (H.R. 2511) in late 2025 signaled a new era of transparency, requiring warning labels for products exceeding 150mg of caffeine per serving.

Celsius has navigated these waters more effectively than its peers by positioning itself as a ""fitness partner"" rather than a ""stimulant."" The company’s focus on thermogenic properties and sugar-free formulas has insulated it from some of the harshest criticisms leveled at ""sugar-bomb"" energy drinks. This shift reflects a broader consumer move toward ""proactive health,"" where every calorie and milligram of caffeine is scrutinized for its functional benefit. The success of Celsius has effectively forced the entire industry to reconsider its marketing tactics, moving away from youth-centric ""hype"" and toward adult-oriented ""utility.""

The Road Ahead: Integration and International Scale

Looking toward the remainder of 2026, the primary challenge for Celsius will be the full integration of Alani Nu and the management of its increasingly complex global supply chain. While the acquisition has provided a massive boost to market share, maintaining the distinct ""voice"" of both brands under one corporate umbrella will require delicate brand management. Investors will be watching closely to see if Celsius can maintain its industry-leading gross margins, which stabilized near 51.5% in late 2025, in the face of fluctuating commodity costs and international shipping pressures.

Short-term opportunities lie in the potential for further international expansion into Asian markets, where the functional beverage category is still in its infancy. However, the brand must also prepare for potential strategic pivots if U.S. regulatory pressure on caffeine intensifies. We may see Celsius experiment more heavily with non-caffeinated ""recovery"" drinks or broaden its reach into the functional water category to future-proof its portfolio against further stimulant-related legislation.

A New Era for Beverage Investors

The story of Celsius Holdings over the past two years is a masterclass in market resilience. From the ""Great Reset"" of 2024 to the ""Alani Nu Rebound"" of 2025, the company has proven that consumer demand for functional, better-for-you beverages is not a fad, but a fundamental shift in the American diet. As we enter 2026, Celsius is no longer the underdog; it is a pillar of the beverage sector, commanding a combined market share that rivals the legacy giants of the past.

For investors, the coming months will be defined by two key metrics: international margin expansion and the resolution of the U.S. regulatory environment. While the era of triple-digit growth may be over, the era of sustainable, diversified profitability appears to have just begun. The energy drink market is no longer just about the ""buzz""—it’s about the ""benefit,"" and for now, Celsius is the brand that has best captured that zeitgeist.

President Donald Trump in December 2025 said his administration would “rebuild” Dulles International Airport, pledging to make major changes to the 63-year-old airport. Dulles is already undergoing a massive transformation aimed at modernizing the airport, launched in 2023. One of the centerpieces of the $7 billion program is a 14-gate, 400,000-square-foot concourse. The three-level space, the size of three football fields, is expected to be completed this fall. However, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy put out a request in December for private-sector proposals to build upon or entirely replace the existing airport. (The Washington Post)

McLean-based candy and pet care giant Mars received the European Union’s blessing to acquire Kellanova, maker of Pringles, Cheez-Its and other snacks, clearing the way to close the $36 billion deal in December 2025. The European Commission, the EU’s antitrust watchdog, concluded after a 90-day investigation that the acquisition would not raise competition concerns in Europe. In June the U.S. Federal Trade Commission issued its approval of the deal, but the EU’s probe delayed its completion from August to the end of 2025. Mars is Virginia’s largest privately owned company, and Kellanova’s brands will be part of the Chicago-based Mars Snacking unit. (VirginiaBusiness.com)

Roanoke City Council’s annual requests for state legislators normally get final approval without a hitch. But at a Dec. 1, 2025, council meeting, one council member questioned why the city’s pursuit of a casino wasn’t included although it is an active endeavor that requires General Assembly approval. Currently, not one state legislator from the Roanoke or New River valleys supports even considering the idea. Mayor Joe Cobb said the casino plan is proceeding on a “different path” and that “the majority of council supports moving forward.” The General Assembly must approve a gambling license for Roanoke to proceed.

How operators can reduce local impacts Data centers can address common community concerns by following best practices, Asare said.
Data center operators need to invest in sustainable design to mitigate environmental issues and avoid placing hyperscale data centers down on undeveloped sites, Nikolopoulos said.
Data centers also can be designed to minimize the disruption to wildlife, which Scandinavian data centers have done in both fjord and forest environments, Nikolopoulos said.
Size and location are key to ensuring data centers do not impose on birds, deer or other native species.","Data center projects have been flooding into Northwest Indiana, often raising concerns from residents who would have to live with them for years to come.

Advocates of data centers say they can be designed to minimize impact, such as by using renewable energy or closed-loop cooling systems that return water to its source.

Academics say communities can take steps to ensure data centers are as sustainable and low-impact as possible, typically by putting requirements in place during the planning and permitting process. When hyperscale data centers come to town, cities and towns can negotiate community benefit agreements that can bring some improvements such as upgrades to the electrical grid, investments in the local workforce and STEM funding in schools, Indiana University Cybersecurity Clinic Executive Director Isak Nti Asare said.

""Local governments have a substantial amount of leverage,"" Asare said. ""They are well aware of what people want and the concerns people have about data centers. Design choices can determine what sort of impact data centers have. Broad things like a cooler climate, lower water stress, strong grid capacity, the protection of sensitive habitat and stormwater can be handled in the design and the deal.""

Experts say there are ways data centers can have a lower impact than many assume, such as by locating on already developed land, using high-efficiency servers, taking advantage of the existing grid, operating at high utilization, reusing waste heat and minimizing water use through closed-loop or air-based cooling, Virginia Tech John W. Hancock Professor of Engineering Dimitrios Nikolopoulos said. They can, for instance, use renewable energy, which some large tech players like Microsoft and Google have pledged to do.

""There’s a wide range in how much data centers rely on renewables. Some big players, like Google and Microsoft, sign long-term power-purchase agreements and aim for 24/7 carbon-free energy, while many other operators still largely depend on conventional grids and renewable energy credits,"" Nikolopoulos said. ""Even '100% renewable' claims usually refer to annual accounting, not real-time clean power. I think we should aim higher: match workloads with local renewables in real time where possible, add on-site solar or storage when it makes sense, and design centers to shift some AI workloads to follow the sun and wind.""

Energy demand is soaring

Data centers use a lot of energy, said University of Chicago professor of computer science Andrew A. Chien. Data centers consumed about 280 terawatt-hours of electricity, or an average of roughly 32 gigawatts of power, over the course of a year.

""This number is growing fast and expected to exceed 80 gigawatts by 2028,"" he said.

By 2028, data centers will consume 8% of all electricity generated in the United States, Chien said. They already account for a major fraction of total grid power in dense data center areas like Northern Virginia, where data centers consume 30% of the power today and are expected to exceed 50% by the mid-2030s. Data centers now consume more than 20% of electricity in Ireland and are projected to use more than 30% of power on the Emerald Isle before 2030.

Data centers are inherently power-guzzling and are not going to reduce energy consumption, Chien said.

""This is not going to happen. Their growth is rapid,"" he said. ""They make significant money on every MWh they consume for cloud and AI, so there is no real economic incentive for them to reduce their growth.""

Data centers, however, can reduce their carbon footprint through measures like energy efficiency, longer equipment lifetimes and the use of low-carbon footprint materials, Chien said. The biggest thing that can be done to make them more sustainable is avoid evaporative cooling to keep water consumption to a minimum.

""Beyond that they should be flexible power grid loads — this reduces the amount of pressure they put on the grid,"" he said. ""That pressure causes much more generation plants and transmission to be built, which is bad for sustainability and it's also not what data centers want, as the pressure slows down approval of their connection to the grid.""

Where data centers are built matters

Data centers can also be located to minimize impact, such as in areas already zoned for industrial use, Nikolopoulos said.

Ideally, they would be located in industrial and commercial areas with strong electric grid connections, good access to clean energy and low-flood and climate risk.

""Locations in cooler climates with access to hydro or wind — like Luleå, Sweden, or parts of Norway—show how siting can dramatically reduce both cooling energy use and the carbon footprint,"" Nikolopoulos said. ""Ideally, they’re also close to where people and businesses actually use data — cities, campuses, transport hubs — so we’re not hauling everything to far-off mega-hubs. I’m particularly fond of reusing old industrial lots, brownfields or even parking structures for modular data centers that blend into what’s already there.""

Air cooling of the computer servers in data centers is possible in colder climates, cutting down on water usage, Asare said. But water can absorb heat, making data centers more energy-efficient so there's a trade-off, he said.

With thoughtful planning, data centers can be sustainable, Nikolopoulos said. Developers need to consider the entire life cycle of data centers, including construction materials, energy mix, water use, hardware refresh and eventual decommissioning, Nikolopoulos said.

""That means high utilization, reuse, and recycling of hardware, and architectures that deliver more compute per watt and per cubic meter — essentially miniaturizing the data center,"" Nikolopoulos said. ""It also means being a good long-term neighbor: sharing waste heat, supporting public services, and being transparent about environmental performance. To me, a sustainable data center isn’t just efficient; it’s built to play the long game with its community.""

How operators can reduce local impacts

Data centers can address common community concerns by following best practices, Asare said. Some options include using a closed-loop system to avoid wasting water or immersion cooling to prevent the discharge of heated water that could disturb aquatic life.

""From my perspective, the future of AI servers is underwater or in some type of fluid with no waste of water,"" he said.

The use of renewable energy to power data centers rather than relying solely on renewable energy matching would minimize the carbon footprint, Nikolopoulos said.

Data center operators need to invest in sustainable design to mitigate environmental issues and avoid placing hyperscale data centers down on undeveloped sites, Nikolopoulos said. He believes the data centers should shift away from mega-campuses to networks of smaller sites with impacts that are easier to monitor and manage.

""They can mitigate impacts by investing heavily in efficiency, clean power and low-water cooling; by avoiding water-intensive designs in drought-prone regions; and by building on already disturbed land rather than carving up new greenfields,"" Nikolopoulos said. ""Many operators are now publishing detailed energy and water metrics and setting targets for power-usage effectiveness and water-usage effectiveness, which is a good start.""

Data centers can take advantage of cold weather to limit cooling needs, use air cooling to minimize water use and capture and recycle heat, such as by using it to heat homes, Asare said.

Lower-impact data centers have been built around the world, including in Scandinavia, Nikolopoulos said. They use high shares of renewable power and seawater or fjord water for cooling.

""Google’s Hamina facility in Finland operates in a converted paper mill, uses seawater cooling from the Bay of Finland, and is now feeding recovered heat into the local district heating network,"" he said. ""In Norway, Lefdal Mine Datacenter runs in a former mine with cold fjord-water cooling and 100% renewable electricity, and Green Mountain’s DC1-Stavanger reuses waste heat to support land-based lobster and trout farming. I see these as early prototypes for a broader shift toward smaller, integrated, community-serving data centers that minimize land, water and carbon footprints rather than giant, stand-alone campuses.""

Environmental concerns must be built in early

Environmental concerns need to be addressed from the start in the design process, such as how data centers are cooled, Nikolopoulos said. Energy, water, noise and heat should be integrated into the design rather than treated as afterthoughts.

""In practice, that points to high-efficiency direct-to-chip liquid or immersion cooling, sometimes paired with free cooling from outside air where the climate allows, and designed from day one to capture and reuse waste heat—for example, feeding it into district heating or industrial processes,"" he said. ""I’d love to see the industry ditch huge, water-guzzling evaporative towers in hot, dry places and move toward smaller, closed-loop systems that pack more computing into less space, with less waste.""

Closed-loop water systems are more expensive but are considered a best practice, Asare said.

""Local governments need to ask about cooling during the permitting process,"" he said. ""It shouldn't be an afterthought. Local governments need to start to think about these things before they give approvals.""

Data centers also can be designed to minimize the disruption to wildlife, which Scandinavian data centers have done in both fjord and forest environments, Nikolopoulos said. Size and location are key to ensuring data centers do not impose on birds, deer or other native species.

""Data centers can avoid harming wildlife by skipping critical habitats and migration paths, using dark-sky-friendly lighting, and ensuring that noise and heat don’t leak into nearby natural areas,"" he said. ""Planting native vegetation and maintaining buffer zones around the site help. Once again, putting smaller centers on land that’s already developed is far gentler than bulldozing untouched greenfields for a giant campus.""

Income tax changes Some Saskatchewan residents could see some increases in their tax credit amounts due to The Saskatchewan Affordability Act and annual inflation indexing, which adjusts taxation rates in accordance with inflation in order to avoid driving people into higher tax brackets, according to the Government of Saskatchewan.

The Saskatchewan Low-Income Tax Credit, which is designed to help the province’s lowest earners, will go up by five per cent for the year as part of a four-year enhancement plan.
The government said these tax credits are “aimed at helping with affordability and are also increasing, including the Low Income Tax Credit, the Disability Tax Credit and supplement, the Caregiver Tax Credit, Personal Care Home Benefit, Active Families Benefit, First-Time Homebuyers Tax Credit and the Graduate Retention Program.” “We recognize that rising costs are challenging, and we remain committed to providing affordability relief for residents,” Jim Reiter, Saskatchewan’s finance minister, said in a statement.","As the calendar flips over to 2026, the Government of Saskatchewan says a number of legislative and tax changes are expected to keep more money in the pockets of residents, especially the lowest earners.

The new year will bring some changes in legislation around the Employment Act and The Saskatchewan Affordability Act, according to the provincial government.

Some of the changes to the Employment Act include:

letting employers use a calendar day rather than 24 consecutive hours to schedule work and overtime hours;

forbidding employers from keeping tips from their employees;

increasing the limit for when employers must notify employees, the minister and any unions of a group termination from 10 employees to 25 employees;

restricting when employers can ask for sick notes;

giving the director of employment standards the authority to order reinstatement and compensation for lost wages in cases of when an employer conducts discriminatory action; and

lengthening various leave arrangements.

The duration of long-term sick leave has also been extended from 12 to 27 weeks, which the ministry said aligns with federal insurance benefits and provides additional job protection to employees who are receiving benefits.

Additionally, maternity leave is being extended to employees who experience a loss of pregnancy “up to 20 weeks before the estimated due date.”

Employees experiencing interpersonal violence are now offered 16 weeks of unpaid leave, in addition to the existing 10 day leave (five days paid and five unpaid).

Bereavement leave has also been extended “to allow the leave within six months of a death rather than a week before or after the funeral, permitting leave for the death of a person the employee considers to be ‘like’ family and for the loss of a pregnancy of an employee or an employee’s immediate family.”

Another change means part-time employees “can participate in modified work arrangements where overtime is paid after the working hours established in the work schedule as opposed to the existing eight hours in a day.”

Employers in the retail sector will no longer be required to give workers two consecutive days off each week, which the ministry said brings retail into line with other sectors, “which must provide one day off.”

Additionally, the amendments mean that employers with non-unionized employees can apply to the director of employment standards “for a variance from the meal break and notice of work schedule change provisions, with the written consent of the employees.” Unions can also negotiate variances from the provisions directly with the employer without needing to go to the director for approval.

Other changes include “clarifying that employees can be paid their wages in cash,” and a further clarification saying employers do not have to provide vacation pay on the period where pay-in-lieu of notice is being provided.

Complete details of the changes can be found on the Government of Saskatchewan’s website.

Income tax changes

Some Saskatchewan residents could see some increases in their tax credit amounts due to The Saskatchewan Affordability Act and annual inflation indexing, which adjusts taxation rates in accordance with inflation in order to avoid driving people into higher tax brackets, according to the Government of Saskatchewan.

This increase in tax credits is part of a four-year income tax reduction plan which the government touts as the “highest tax-free income tax threshold in Canada.”

The government also income tax changes in 2026 will “provide Saskatchewan residents $42 million in tax savings in the coming year that would have occurred as a result of inflation.”

“This preserves the real value of the amount all taxpayers can earn without paying tax, particularly benefiting those on fixed incomes,” the government added.

The amount individuals can earn before taxes are applied will go up to $20,381 for 2026 from $19,491 in 2025. The government said this increase is part of the plan to add $500 each year to that amount and other personal credits through to 2028, plus inflation adjustments.

Other personal tax credits, including spousal, dependent child and senior supplementary amounts, will also see the same $500 raise, in addition to indexation for the 2026 tax year, as the Sask. Party promised during the recent provincial election campaign.

The Saskatchewan Low-Income Tax Credit, which is designed to help the province’s lowest earners, will go up by five per cent for the year as part of a four-year enhancement plan.

Federal income tax brackets and the level of income a person can earn before taxes are applied by Ottawa are also indexed to inflation (two per cent for 2026) and the lowest federal tax rate drops to 14 per cent in 2026, the province noted in a statement.

The government said these tax credits are “aimed at helping with affordability and are also increasing, including the Low Income Tax Credit, the Disability Tax Credit and supplement, the Caregiver Tax Credit, Personal Care Home Benefit, Active Families Benefit, First-Time Homebuyers Tax Credit and the Graduate Retention Program.”

“We recognize that rising costs are challenging, and we remain committed to providing affordability relief for residents,” Jim Reiter, Saskatchewan’s finance minister, said in a statement.

“Annual indexation, combined with the income tax measures in this year’s budget, help to keep Saskatchewan among the most affordable places to live in Canada.”

Saskatchewan Chamber of Commerce response

On Dec. 4, the Saskatchewan Chamber of Commerce submitted its review of the labour relations provisions of The Saskatchewan Employment Act.

In the report, the Chamber recommended the Act be updated to clarify matters, such as, “how to conduct representation votes for remote or multi-site workforces; what constitutes access to employees for communications in digital workplaces; and how notice requirements apply when workers are geographically dispersed.”

The Chamber made 10 recommendations for the ministry, including: to “maintain an employer’s ability to bring in replacement workers, make the provincial construction collective agreements either opt-in, or opt-out, for unionized businesses in the construction industry and provide clear, plain-language guidance on lawful communication during organizing drives.”",https://media-cdn.socastsrm.com/wordpress/wp-content/blogs.dir/648/files/2025/12/person-filling-out-tax-forms.jpg,N,,2026-01-01 11:59:35.518079

“Blocking construction on all offshore wind projects underway in the U.S. is an attack on our economy and our public health,” Melinda Pierce, legislative director of Sierra Club, said. The Trump administration’s vengeance towards renewable energy knows no end. Instead of progressing us forward as a nation, they are obsessed with attacking a growing industry that provides good clean energy jobs and affordable, clean electricity. Americans need cheaper and more reliable energy that does not come at the expense of our health and futures.”",https://i0.wp.com/s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/media.nationofchange.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/26070517/offshore-wind-netherlands.webp?fit=1200%2C787&ssl=1,N,,2026-01-01 15:58:27.978504

“You want one?” asked a conference attendee, offering me the pin with a smirk. ​“It can be a souvenir.”

Stevenson, with a soft wave, gestured to the man to leave me alone. I was the only credentialed member of a legacy news organization attending this gathering, covering it for South Carolina’s largest newspaper, The Post and Courier, where I worked at the time. One organizer of the meeting, the Heartland Institute’s 2023 International Conference on Climate Change, blamed the media’s ​“constant lies” for the ban on some members of the press.

But Stevenson, then a policy director for the conservative think tank the Caesar Rodney Institute, had personally advocated for me to cover the event. He favored transparency and had no problem talking to me for hours about his primary political cause: making sure no offshore wind farms were ever built in U.S. waters.

The conference drew luminaries from the world of climate skepticism, from Alex Epstein, author of ​“The Moral Case for Fossil Fuels,” to Judith Curry and Ross McKitrick, a cherry-picking duo of marginal researchers more recently known for authoring a controversial 141-page government report downplaying the effects of human-caused climate change for the Trump administration. Rep. Lauren Boebert gave a keynote speech, mocking Democrats’ climate concerns. She held court next to the hotel pool that night, smoking a cigar with leaders from major conservative think tanks underneath palm fronds swaying in the breeze.

Stevenson saw himself as an outlier there. He leaned over during one session to tell me, cheekily, that he might be the ​“only person here who believes in climate change.”

And yet, despite that belief, Stevenson has dedicated the better part of a decade to obstructing a source of clean energy that can help replace the fossil fuels that are baking the planet. In fact, that’s why he was at the Heartland Institute’s conference: to rail against offshore wind farms.

The following day, Stevenson laid out his case in an expansive and mostly empty ballroom. It’s too expensive, he argued from a lectern, and the United States was not effectively assessing its environmental impact. He suggested a plan to get the public to care about this issue: putting whales front and center.

Stevenson stopped short of blaming wind companies for the spate of whale carcasses that had washed up on New Jersey and New York beaches just weeks prior. He agreed with the scientific evidence that ​“vessel strikes” — not wind development — were the biggest threat in that region. Still, the potential for harm to whales could be a powerful tool in federal court, he speculated, as well as in the court of public opinion.

At the time, Biden officials were approving new offshore wind projects at ​“breakneck speed.” Republican opposition was somewhat scant; GOP lawmakers in deep-red South Carolina had just put forth a pro–offshore wind bill. However, nuclear power — the energy sector Stevenson wanted to see advance — appeared to be on the downswing, with many U.S. facilities having recently shuttered.

We parted ways after two days together at the conference, and I ultimately decided not to write a story about Stevenson. He seemed like little more than a gadfly to an increasingly powerful, multibillion-dollar offshore wind industry. I didn’t think much of it when he told me at the time that the industry would ​“crumble” before it even reached South Carolina.

I should have believed him; Stevenson was right.

The once high-flying offshore wind industry has been brought to its knees this year by President Donald Trump. In just the past few months, the Trump administration halted a nearly finished wind farm, clawed back $679 million in offshore wind grants, and moved to cancel permits for three other massive wind farms. Multiple fully permitted projects have been shelved. New development in the U.S. seems impossible.

The stakes are high, particularly for the Northeast, where offshore wind was meant to not only slash emissions but also lower power bills, shore up grid reliability, and revitalize down-on-their-luck port towns with well-paying jobs. Strangling the sector for four years will be a devastating blow to these hopes.

Trump himself has a deep disdain for offshore wind, sparked by his failure to block a project from being built within view of his Scotland golf course a decade ago. But there is perhaps no other single person more responsible for watering the seeds of offshore wind opposition than Stevenson.

A January 2025 study by a Brown University research group placed Stevenson at the center of the network of activists and political operators driving America’s anti–offshore wind movement. The data showed he had an outsize influence in galvanizing lawsuits and public protests against wind farms. The analysis also tied Stevenson to a larger web of ​“dark money” networks that are financially backed by the fossil-fuel industry.

“The Brown study actually was fairly accurate about writing down all the people involved. … I was probably the common denominator for those groups,” Stevenson told me earlier this year.

Stevenson doesn’t fit into the neat box of being a climate denier. He doesn’t think we should continue burning fossil fuels forever. Instead, he’s someone who seeks to block certain solutions that address climate change, for reasons of his own — namely, ​“affordable and reliable” energy sources like nuclear and solar are better options, in his view. But scholars I spoke to about this discordance weren’t surprised at all.

“Outright climate denying seems to be decreasing,” said Alaina Kinol, a PhD candidate at Northeastern University who studies resistance to climate policy. ​“What we’re seeing more is obstruction … and tactics that delay action.”

After selling his construction business to one of his sons, Stevenson became interested in shaping state policies. A self-described libertarian, he found a home around 2010 at the Caesar Rodney Institute, a Delaware affiliate of the State Policy Network, which the Brown University researchers call ​“the nation’s most prominent network of conservative state-level think tanks.”

According to the D.C.-based research firm Energy Policy Institute, CRI is among a half dozen ​“front groups” backed by fossil-fuel interests that regularly attack renewable energy in their local regions.

For a few years, Stevenson worked on a variety of issues at CRI, from data centers and solid-state fuel cells to pipeline infrastructure and Delaware’s carbon-emissions fee. His initial brush with offshore wind came in 2010, when he sent a measured letter to the Obama administration regarding Bluewater Wind, the first proposed wind farm off the coast of Delaware. He voiced opposition to wind tax credits but acknowledged ​“one of the benefits of windmills” is how quickly they can be built.

It wasn’t until 2017 that he focused deeply on offshore wind, and by then his stance on the energy source was more firmly negative.

Plans for Skipjack Wind Farm — a 966-megawatt Danish-led project slated for waters off Maryland’s coastline with onshore stations in Delaware — were advancing quickly. They took Stevenson by surprise. ​“My initial response was just the high cost,” he recalled, though he also worried about the turbines ruining the ​“pristine view.”

The project was led by Ørsted, the world’s largest developer of offshore wind, which had bought the lease from the developers of Bluewater Wind. Stevenson said he tried to enlist help to fight the company, turning to Washington connections he’d forged during his time serving on Trump’s first transition team for the Environmental Protection Agency.

“I knew a lot of people; we had a lot of conversations,” Stevenson recalled. ​“They told me that I was nuts for taking on offshore wind.”

At the time, Trump officials were actively backing the sector. Former Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke described himself as ​“very bullish on offshore wind” and executed key lease auctions put forth by the Obama administration — first near North Carolina, then near Massachusetts. Anti-wind policies wouldn’t emerge until the latter half of Trump 1.0, when Zinke’s successor, David Bernhardt, began slow-walking federal permits for offshore projects.

Stevenson received little response from his Washington connections. Undeterred, he simply led an anti-wind campaign on his own.

He attended town hall meetings and submitted public comments. He and fellow residents of local coastal communities organized against the wind project under the name Save Our Beach View, mailing over 35,000 letters and posting constantly to Facebook.

The messages contained several misleading statements. Independent journalist Michael Thomas reported that the letters, for example, ​“falsely claimed that the project could cause coastal residents’ property values to drop by between 20% and 30%; power costs could rise by 400%; key industries like tourism could see their revenues fall by 50%.”

Nevertheless, Stevenson’s efforts delayed the permitting process for an onshore substation, which in turn delayed wind turbine construction off the Delmarva coast from a planned 2022 start date to 2026 at the earliest. In January of this year, days after Trump took office for his second term, Ørsted moved to refinance the project, likely kicking it even further down the road.

Ultimately, Stevenson said, he ​“won the battle.”

In 2019, emboldened by his win against Skipjack Wind, Stevenson started searching on social media platforms and in news articles for the names of other residents across the Northeast who were resisting offshore wind farms. He reached out to some of them by phone — ​“just cold-called them,” he said with a laugh.

He found that there were plenty of individuals, as well as some small groups, protesting with little experience. For example, a handful of activists known as Protect Our Coast NJ didn’t know how to establish themselves as a nonprofit entity. Stevenson said he helped them do it.

Stevenson also started to organize monthly calls among activists from different states. His reach slowly grew from Massachusetts down to North Carolina, with the idea of spreading the tactics he honed in Delaware to other states. What Stevenson would bring them — as the Brown University researchers put it — was ​“political power.” Filings show that Stevenson’s employer, the Caesar Rodney Institute, also accepted donations from the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers in both 2019 and 2020.

His network of grassroots activists evolved into the American Coalition for Ocean Protection, which made its public debut in 2021 with a press conference in front of the Massachusetts Statehouse. Four other State Policy Network think tanks had also joined by then.

There, wearing a blue sport coat and flanked by maps of planned wind farms, Stevenson announced that the Caesar Rodney Institute had set up a $75,000 legal fund to support residents along the east coast who wanted to sue to halt offshore wind development. He publicly set a goal of raising $500,000 for the campaign.

Stevenson would later admit that while the coalition’s fundraising ​“did pretty well,” it never reached anywhere close to his financial goal. No matter. It was the coalition’s relentless messaging and coordination, not so much the money, that would become its greatest weapon.

Still, even then, Stevenson refused to repeat blatantly false claims about the sector’s impact on whales. He posted statements on CRI’s website that the exact harm to the critically endangered North Atlantic right whales by wind development was still ​“unknown” and told me that his official position was to ​“wait and see” what federal scientists find after investigating the recently washed-up whale carcasses.

I asked at the time if he thought the explosion of attention on whales and wind power would peter out. He replied that it would, adding that eventually all these newcomers would oppose wind farms because of ​“the economics.”

But if Stevenson didn’t personally amplify the message, he didn’t swear it off. Nor did he discourage the groups he collaborated with from peddling it. In fact, he nearly won an award for elevating the issue: In June 2023, his campaign against offshore wind was a finalist for the Best Issue Campaign award presented at State Policy Network’s annual meeting. (The nomination highlighted that the campaign prompted a U.S. General Accountability Office report into the matter. That analysis, released earlier this year, found no evidence that the wind industry harms whales.)

Over time, the whale issue metastasized, coming to define political debate over offshore wind farms.

Eventually, Stevenson himself embraced some of its more conspiratorial claims. In a statement posted to the Cesar Rodney Institute website in summer 2024, he wrote: ​“We have patiently waited for indisputable evidence that offshore wind is killing whales despite federal agencies repeatedly stating that no such evidence exists. It does now.”

The ​“evidence” was two documents posted online, neither of which had been peer-reviewed. One report, by the consultant Robert Rand, looked at the acoustic output of wind vessels in the U.S. — during both seabed surveys and pile-driving activities — and claimed that the underwater noise levels were much higher than federal scientists had estimated and could result in hearing loss and ​“harassment” of whales. The second report, by a retired computer science professor, used correlation alone to link the timing of New Jersey whale deaths to local wind farm survey work.

Douglas Nowacek, a professor at Duke University leading a multiyear investigation of wind farm impacts on wildlife, discredited these conclusions.

As it stands, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, ​“there is no scientific evidence that noise resulting from offshore wind site characterization surveys could potentially cause whale deaths. There are no known links between large whale deaths and ongoing offshore wind activities.”

In fact, government data overwhelmingly links whales’ deaths to other causes. For nearly a decade, agencies have carefully documented humpbacks in the North Atlantic washing ashore at an increasing rate. The species is not endangered, but in 2016, its plummeting population warranted a government-assigned designation: an ​“unusual mortality event.”

In this ongoing phenomena, 40% of the dead humpback whales autopsied by experts revealed injuries that only vessels or fishing gear could inflict. The rest, according to government data, were too decomposed to determine the cause of death. Scientists generally agree that climate change, which is driving up ocean temperatures and pushing whale prey farther north, could also be playing a role in the die-off. The whales are expending more energy than ever just to catch a meal. Some juveniles have washed up emaciated.

I asked Stevenson, soon after Trump’s second inauguration, if he still trusted NOAA’s ability to objectively assess the impact of turbine development on whales, and he was clear: ​“No.”

Empire Wind, one of the two projects ordered to pause this year, has since resumed construction — but only after the developer, Norwegian energy firm Equinor, launched a monthlong lobbying blitz. According to Norway’s largest newspaper, the company mobilized ​“500 phone calls and meetings” — an effort employees dubbed ​“Operation Gandalf” — which helped secure a reversal from Trump.

Still, Stevenson pushed for more wins, advocating for a complete overhaul of the Interior Department’s approval process for wind. In May, he penned another letter with some coalition members to Burgum requesting those changes.

At the time Trump was reelected, BloombergNEF expected 39 gigawatts of offshore wind generating capacity to come online in America by 2035. The research group hedged that number to 21.5 gigawatts if Trump managed to repeal wind tax credits during his term.

Today, with tax credits already sent to an early grave and no new permits issued, that prediction has fallen off a cliff. BNEF downgraded its projection two months ago to just 6 gigawatts. In other words, Trump’s assault has been so effective that it’s likely no new offshore wind farms will be built in America for the next decade — save for the five already under construction.

Opponents of the sector have won the war on wind in the near term.

“They are clearly feeling emboldened by Donald Trump,” said J. Timmons Roberts, a professor of environmental studies and sociology at Brown University who led the study that placed Stevenson at the heart of America’s anti-wind movement.

It’s not just Trump: Over the past year, more Republicans have grown verbally hostile to offshore wind. Burgum has played up reliability concerns, which lack evidence, and raised alarm bells about the impact to tourism and fishing, while peddling false claims that climate change predictions were overblown. This fall, the defeated Republican candidate for New Jersey governor, Jack Ciattarelli, made banishing wind farms a core agenda item, selling anti-wind tote bags and koozies on his campaign website.

Under Trump, government officials are rolling out more eyebrow-raising narratives — ones that go beyond whales — for halting wind projects. Some defy science and logic, like Burgum’s claims that New England’s Revolution Wind, the other project paused by Trump, makes the U.S. vulnerable to underwater drone attacks. (A federal judge has since lifted the stop work order.)

Kinol, the Northeastern University researcher, says these kinds of narratives fit under the umbrella of ​“climate obstruction.” The term, she said, describes ​“the intentional use of misleading, misinforming, or misdirecting narratives to slow or prevent climate action.”

The concept has been around since the 1990s, when scholars first investigated the American Petroleum Institute’s downplaying of climate change. But as the debate about climate change — and what to do about it — evolved, so did the opposition. Kinol said talking points that preach wind farms as bad news for whales or national security are ​“a known and studied strategy.”

“This is an example of ​‘downside emphasis.’ … A wind farm opponent emphasizes the downsides of renewable energy,” said Kinol. ​“The reason why it’s a well-known tactic of obstruction is because the same emphasis on protecting species is not present for the same groups when they’re talking about fossil-fuel build-out.”

These kinds of arguments are ​“disingenuous,” said Kinol, ultimately in service of a phenomena she and her colleagues call ​“climate delay.”

Stevenson is one example of what is now a clear trend: The denial of climate change is being steadily replaced by attacks on solutions to address it. This twist is detailed in a new book written and edited by Roberts and three colleagues titled ​“Climate Obstruction: A Global Assessment.” The book came out in early fall — just in time for its authors to witness their ideas play out in real life with a decade-long delay of U.S. offshore wind farm development now becoming reality.

Conspiratorial sentiments are plaguing other clean energy sectors, too, from exaggerated claims of bird-killing onshore turbines to markedly false statements about toxic solar panels. Anti-renewables talking points circulate online, penetrate town hall meetings, and are taken up by groups pushing back against renewables now more than ever. A June study released by Columbia University identified 498 contested wind and solar projects across 49 states in 2024, marking a 32% jump in opposed projects, compared to just one year prior.

“You want a healthy amount of skepticism in a democracy. … You don’t want 100% believers,” said Dietram Scheufele, a social scientist at the University of Madison–Wisconsin who studies public perspectives on science and technology. But he warned that skepticism in the U.S. is ​“on steroids,” pushing people from the middle into polarized political camps and toward conspiratorial thinking.

Stevenson, for his part, is stepping away from his work in the anti–offshore wind movement, and seemed relieved to be doing so.

On our most recent call, in late November, Stevenson told me that he had resigned from CRI and that his anti–offshore wind coalition was, for all practical purposes, disbanded. (He remains a named plaintiff in four lawsuits opposing wind development.)

He’d rather be ​“solving the nuclear waste problem,” Stevenson told me. The energy source has long had a toxic-byproduct issue, not to mention cost overruns, which, to be sure, eclipse any expense associated with offshore wind over the long run. The Trump administration is looking to revive America’s nuclear industry — and that’s where Stevenson wants to build his legacy.

Even this work advocating for nuclear power could be seen as a form of ​“climate delay,” according to a popular research framework used by Kinol and Roberts. Nuclear plants put forth today can take a decade or more to start providing power; many of the proposed offshore wind projects that Stevenson’s coalition targeted would have come online well before then.

Stevenson also told me on the phone that he is starting a new position. Soon, he’ll become the director for energy and environmental policy at the Michigan-based Mackinac Center for Public Policy. This think tank, like CRI, is part of the State Policy Network. Exxon Mobil and the Charles G. Koch Charitable Foundation are among the center’s funders.

I congratulated Stevenson on his new job. He thanked me. His tone warmed as he reminded me that we’d probably had a dozen phone calls over the years.

I said it was quite possible that his legacy would be as the man who helped crush a renewable energy sector that could have done much to address the planet’s biggest problem. I asked Stevenson what he thought about that view — that readers might see it that way.

“I don’t care if people hate me or not,” he said. ​“I’m doing what I think is right.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/newstevensonarmchair-2048x1536.jpeg,N,,2026-01-01 11:59:16.426869

Yesterday, more than 11 months after being inaugurated, President Trump vetoed his first bills of this term. Both had passed Congress with broad bipartisan support. These were not divisive bills. So these vetoes pit the president against his fellow Republicans and raise the question of how far they might go to defy the president. NPR White House correspondent Danielle Kurtzleben is here to walk us through details. Hey there.

DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN, BYLINE: Hey there.

KELLY: What did he veto?

KURTZLEBEN: Well, the first is a bill that would have helped communities in southeastern Colorado pay for a conduit that would carry clean water. The bill would have done that by giving them more time to repay money without interest to the federal government. Now, that conduit is important because residents there have dealt with unsafe water. Some of the groundwater is tainted with toxic elements like radium. The other bill deals with Florida. It would have expanded the area reserved for the Miccosukee Tribe and required the secretary of the interior to help safeguard communities there from flooding.

KELLY: OK. Let me take these one by one. The Colorado one, first, and this clean water conduit. Why did President Trump veto it?

KURTZLEBEN: Well, his stated reason is that the bill would force federal taxpayers to foot the bill for a local water project that, as initially envisioned, would have been paid for by the local communities. He added in a statement that he's committed to ending, quote, ""the massive cost of taxpayer handouts."" But it's important to get a sense of the scope here. Federal funding has paid for a large chunk of this project, but as our colleagues at Colorado Public Radio have pointed out, this particular bill would cost the federal government less than $500,000, according to a Congressional Budget Office estimate, which, in terms of federal spending, is absolutely tiny.

KELLY: May I ask about the language you just used? You just told us the president's stated reason for vetoing this. Is there a reason to think there are other motives in play?

KURTZLEBEN: Well, Colorado Republican Representative Lauren Boebert has raised this possibility. In a statement, she said, quote, ""I sincerely hope this veto has nothing to do with political retaliation."" She clashed with the president this year by pushing for the release of the Epstein files, but Trump has not explicitly linked that to his veto.

But in addition, Trump, earlier this year, threatened what he called harsh measures if a woman named Tina Peters was not released from a Colorado prison. Peters was a county clerk in Mesa County, Colorado, and she is serving a nine-year sentence for helping someone get access to voting equipment after the 2020 election. So the whole case is tied to conspiracy theories about election fraud. Earlier this month, Trump said he was pardoning Peters, but presidential pardons apply to federal crimes. Peters was convicted at the state level, so she remains in prison. Now, again, Trump has not explicitly linked Peters to this veto, but this morning, he posted on social media that he wants Peters freed, so we know she's on his mind.

KELLY: OK. Go to the other one, the Florida veto. What are the reasons, stated or otherwise, for that veto?

KURTZLEBEN: Well, Trump was straightforward in saying this veto was in part about politics. He said in a statement that the Miccosukee Tribe, quote, ""has actively sought to obstruct reasonable immigration policies."" Now, that seems to refer to the tribe earlier this year joining a lawsuit against an immigration detention center the Trump administration created in Florida, the one the president calls Alligator Alcatraz. The tribe considers the land it's built on sacred.

KELLY: To circle back to something I said at the outset, that both these bills, Florida and Colorado, they passed with the support of the president's GOP colleagues in Congress, right?

KURTZLEBEN: Yes. In fact, they both passed the House and Senate without those person-by-person roll call votes. The bills just had so much support. They were able to pass via voice votes or unanimous consent. So now the question is whether Congress can or wants to override Trump's vetoes.

KELLY: That's NPR's Danielle Kurtzleben. Thank you, Danielle.

KURTZLEBEN: Thank you.

KELLY: And Happy New Year.

KURTZLEBEN: You too.

In late December, two environmental organizations, the California Native Plant Society and the Environmental Council of Sacramento, filed a lawsuit against the County of Sacramento for its recent approval of the Coyote Creek Agrivoltaic Ranch project. That initiative, also known as the CCAR, is slated for the rolling hills and grazing lands of eastern Sacramento County between Prairie City SVRA and the Deer Creek Hills Preserve.

The environmental groups cited “numerous deficiencies” in the project’s Final Environmental Impact Report (final EIR), including failure to sufficiently address the potential impacts to two streams that flow into Deer Creek, a tributary of the Cosumnes River and the last Sierra Nevada watershed river without a major storage dam on it. The plaintiffs also pointed to the loss of 3,493 trees from the project that will be incurred from “industrial-level repurposing” of the land.

DESRI, the ownership behind the proposal, describes the Coyote Creek Agrivoltaic Ranch as a “renewable energy project” that will “deliver significant economic and environmental benefits to Sacramento County and the greater region.” DESRI is an investor and operator of renewable energy projects across the United States.

In a statement, DESRI argued that “independent economic modeling” by Economic and Planning Systems has projected that construction activities and related purchases of local goods and services for the agrivoltaic ranch will inject more than $365 million into the Sacramento economy.

“A major share of these benefits will come from the project’s commitment to employ highly trained union labor,” the company stated. “Construction of the solar and battery energy storage system is expected to create up to 350 good-paying jobs during the buildout period.”

William Risse, Director of Development at DESRI, weighed in directly.

“This project represents a significant investment in Sacramento County’s economy,” Risse asserted. “It will support new job creation and a resilient, skilled workforce while generating cost-effective and reliable power for the community.”

The Sacramento Metro Chamber of Commerce is backing the project, with Robert Heidt, the group’s President and CEO, insisting that initiatives like Coyote Creek “deliver lasting value for Sacramento County by generating millions in local investment and supporting hundreds of good-paying jobs.”

However, the environmental plaintiffs had warned county officials ahead of a Sacramento Board of Supervisors vote on Nov. 18 that the project that its final EIR “is so deeply flawed that it is insufficient to support informed decision-making.”

CNPS Conservation Program Director Nick Jensen stands behind that assessment.

“We’re talking about trees dating back to the time of Ghengis Khan and the Middle Ages—destroyed without appropriate due diligence and in conflict with the county’s own plans,” Jensen said, referencing the multiple ways the project is out of compliance with the Sacramento County General Plan.

Environmental Council Policy Analyst Luz Lim echoed Jensen’s concerns.

“This is not a choice between clean energy or irreplaceable habitat,” Luz contended. “We all want and need appropriately planned clean energy for our county, but thanks to other projects underway, SMUD is already on track to fulfill its 2030 Zero Net Carbon Plan. Instead, and ironically, we’re potentially destroying thousands of oaks, which are one of nature’s most powerful tools to trap and sequester carbon.”

Luz added that a single oak can sequester vast amounts of carbon each year and support as many as 300 different types of wildlife, making these native trees a “nature-based solution” to the impacts of climate change.

Some ecologists also use the term “keystone species” to describe oaks, because of their disproportionately large impact on ecosystems.

Critics say that one example of the final EIR’s deficiencies can be found in how it accounts for a 1:1 replacement of oak saplings for each mature oak removed. In contrast, the Sacramento County General Plan calls for one tree seedling for each inch of trunk diameter removed—a total 79,126.40 inches, according to the Arborist’s report for the project.

In a November Sacramento Bee article, U.C. Berkeley integrative biology professor Todd Dawson, said the mitigation is “severely misaligned with the timescale to reestablish ‘mature’ trees and the woodlands they would compose,” and explained that blue oak acorns are hard to grow successfully, and that young trees often die from heat, drought or being eaten by wildlife.

“The project also represents potential and significant ecological impacts to two perennial streams feeding into Deer Creek and ultimately the Cosumnes River; multiple sensitive or endangered species, such as tricolored blackbird, burrowing owl, and American badger,” the plaintiffs argued, “and 25% of the entire known occurrences of the rare western spiked rosinweed.”

Environmental advocates note that concern over the Coyote Creek project has “generated an outpouring” of local activism, including hundreds of people showing up for the November Board of Supervisors vote. More than 150 people spoke at the meeting, and more than 900 provided written comments, with 95% of them opposed to the project.”

“Destroying high quality intact habitat that is home to some of the highest biodiversity and highest capacity for carbon sequestration in the county is unacceptable and sets a dangerous precedent for future development,” said Carol Witham, an ecologist and representative of the local CNPS Sacramento Valley Chapter. “One of the largest threats to biodiversity is climate change, the approval of projects like this makes efforts to reduce this threat a threat of its own.”",https://sacramento.newsreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/lawsuit.jpg,N,,2026-01-01 10:58:57.843040

Bernie Sanders and right-wing Gov. Ron DeSantis agree on virtually nothing. But they found common ground this year as leading skeptics of the artificial intelligence industry's data center boom.

The alignment of two national figures on the left and right signals that a political reckoning is brewing over the AI industry's impact on electricity prices, grid stability and the labor market. The opposition could slow the industry's development plans if it reaches a broad bipartisan consensus.

Sanders, I-VT, has called for a national moratorium on data center construction.

""Frankly, I think you've got to slow this process down,"" Sanders told CNN in a Dec. 28 interview. ""It's not good enough for the oligarchs to tell us it's coming — you adapt. What are they talking about? They're going to guarantee healthcare to all people? What are they going to do when people have no jobs?""

Florida Gov. DeSantis unveiled an AI bill of rights on Dec. 4 that would protect local communities' right to block data center construction among other provisions. The staunch Republican's proposal could run afoul of the White House, which is pushing to scale up AI as quickly as possible. President Donald Trump issued an executive order on Dec. 11 to prevent ""excessive state regulation"" of AI.

""We have a limited grid. You do not have enough grid capacity in the United States to do what they're trying to do,"" DeSantis said of the AI industry's data center plans at an event in The Villages, Florida.

""As more and more information has gotten out, do you want a hyperscale data center in The Villages? Yes or no,"" the governor asked. ""I think most people would say they don't want it.""

DeSantis is finishing out his second term as Florida's governor and his future political ambitions are unclear. Sanders has said his fourth term as Vermont's senator will likely be his last.

Florida and Vermont are not major data center states. But rising utility bills played a key role in the landslide victory of Democrat Abigail Spanberger in the governor's race this year in Virginia, the world's largest data center market.

Residential electricity prices are forecast to rise another 4% on average nationwide in 2026 after increasing about 5% in 2025, according to the federal Energy Information Administration.

With cost of living at the center of American politics, the impact of data centers on local communities will likely play a role in the mid-term elections next November.

""We have gone from a period where data centers were sort of seen as an unmitigated good and as an engine of growth by a lot of elected officials and policymakers to people now recognizing that we're short,"" said Abe Silverman, who served as general counsel for the public utility board in New Jersey from 2019 until 2023 under Democrat Gov. Phil Murphy.

""We do not have enough generation to reliably serve existing customers and data centers,"" Silverman said.

The shortage is most acute on the nation's largest grid, PJM Interconnection, where data center demand is pushing the system to a tipping point. The grid will be six gigawatts short of its reliability requirement by 2027, according to PJM.

The power shortage is nearly equivalent to the electricity demand of Philadelphia, Silverman said. This makes blackouts more likely, he said. ""Instead of a blackout happening every one in 10 years, we're looking at something more often,"" the analyst said.

""It's at a crisis stage right now. PJM has never been this short,"" said Joe Bowring, president of Monitoring Analytics, which serves as the independent market monitor for PJM.

PJM Interconnection serves more than 65 million people across 13 states in the Mid-Atlantic and Midwest. It includes pivotal swing states for the mid-term elections like Pennsylvania and Virginia.

The price to secure power capacity in PJM has exploded in recent years with $23 billion attributable to data centers, according to watchdog Monitoring Analytics. Those costs are ultimately passed on to consumers. This amounts to a ""massive wealth transfer,"" the watchdog told PJM in a November letter.

""I don't think we've seen the end of the political repercussions,"" said Rob Gramlich, president of Grid Strategies, a power sector consulting firm.

""And with a lot more elections in 2026 than 2025, we'll see a lot of implications,"" Gramlich said. ""Every politician is going to be saying that they have the answer to affordability and their opponents' policies would raise rates.""

The shortage will be exacerbated by Trump's recent decision to pause all offshore wind farms under construction off the East Coast, Silverman said. This includes Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind, a massive 2.6 gigawatt project that would help supply the huge data center market in northern Virginia.

""By stopping a project that had line of sight to coming online in the very near future, you are directly increasing the prices that we all pay for electricity and not by a little bit,"" Silverman said. ""That's a huge, huge additional hole that we now have to dig out of.""

Data centers are facing pushback on multiple fronts now. The PJM watchdog has called for the grid to reject data centers that it does not have the power to serve or require them to bring their own generation. Virginia's utility regulator is now requiring data centers to pay a majority of the cost of new transmission and generation that serves them beginning in 2027.

Data center developers next year will likely start moving to build more power plants onsite, called co-location, as they struggle to secure supply on the grid quickly, said Brian Fitzsimons, CEO of GridUnity, a company that uses software to help utilities navigate connection requests.

But Silverman said ""co-location"" has problems that will also face political scrutiny.

""Co-location is effectively taking a generator off the market,"" he said. ""It would be unethical to end up with a situation where data centers are able to buy private power plants that expose the rest of us to a greater chance of blackouts.""",https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108234669-1764617288677-gettyimages-2229069495-DATA_CENTERS.jpeg?v=1766057941&w=1920&h=1080,N,,2026-01-01 10:12:55.173060

These moves also brought movement in the battle against Enbridge’s Line 5 pipeline, the state’s efforts to move away from coal power and encouraged the build out of data centers – which have faced widespread pushback from communities throughout the state.

Data centers draw the ire of residents across the state

As a state law offering tax breaks on data center construction and equipment took effect earlier this year, tech companies are flocking to Michigan in hopes of building out additional facilities to advance artificial intelligence development while communities are increasingly pushing back against these projects.

In the past month, frustration from residents against the lack of transparency into many of these deals – with local officials and landowners bound by non-disclosure agreements – has hit a fever pitch with a few hundred residents gathering at the Michigan Capitol in Lansing to push back against these developments.

While regulations specific to data centers are limited to the conditions for receiving the tax break, lawmakers are stepping up to address their constituents’ concerns, with a bipartisan group of House representatives introducing legislation to repeal the tax breaks for these resource-intensive facilities.

Another group of lawmakers in the Senate has put forth regulations to bar entities withdrawing above an average of 2,000,000 gallons of water per day for consumptive use from obtaining a water withdrawal permit, require the Michigan Public Service Commission to publish reports on data centers’ energy and water use and ensure residents don’t bear the cost of upgrading water systems to serve these facilities.

Line 5 lawsuits continue as U.S. Army Corps of Engineers expedites review of tunnel project

Following a years-long legal battle over whether Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel’s case to remove Enbridge’s Line 5 pipeline from the Great Lakes should be heard in state or federal courts, the case returned to the Ingham County’s 30th Judicial Circuit Court in Lansing at the start of the year.

The United States Supreme Court has also agreed to hear an appeal of the decision that sent the case back to Michigan in the first place.

Additionally, attorneys for Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and the director of the Department of Natural Resources have asked the U.S. Supreme Court to review whether the state is immune from legal action for its decision to revoke Enbridge’s easement to operate the pipeline on the bottomlands of the Straits of Mackinac, where Lake Huron and Lake Michigan meet.

A decision to take up this case could carry even further weight, with a federal judge barring the state from enforcing its notice terminating Enbridge’s easement to operate Line 5 on the bottomlands of the Great Lakes.

In yet another legal challenge before the Michigan Supreme Court, justices agreed to review whether the Michigan Public Service Commission – which oversees siting matters for pipelines within the state – erred in its decision to issue one of the permits needed for Enbridge to begin construction on its tunnel project.

The state’s highest court will hear two challenges, one filed by FLOW Water Advocates, and another filed by the Bay Mills Indian Community, Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians, Little Traverse Bay Bands of Odawa Indians, and Nottawaseppi Huron Band of the Potawatomi. That case also includes several clean water and environmental advocates as plaintiffs, including the Michigan Climate Action Network and the Environmental Law & Policy Center.

Opponents argue the commission failed to make determinations required by the Michigan Environmental Protection Act, had improperly excluded evidence while considering the permit and failed to consider alternatives to the pipeline outside of the Straits of Mackinac.

Additionally, the Army Corps of Engineers’ long awaited environmental impact statement assessing the plan to replace the two segments of pipeline located in the Straits with a new segment placed in a tunnel embedded into the bedrock beneath the lake was issued in May.

An executive order issued by the Trump Administration in January has also permitted the project’s environmental review to move forward under a shortened timeline.

EPA lifts emergency order on Flint water, residents mark milestones on lead line replacement

More than 11 years after the beginning of the Flint Water Crisis, the United States Environmental Protection Agency lifted its emergency order on the city’s drinking water, which was put in place in 2016.

However, community members were quick to note that the decision, which came alongside the end of the city’s lead line replacement program, does not mean that the city’s pipes are lead free.

While Flint and the state of Michigan have met their obligations under a 2017 settlement requiring them to replace all lead lines in the city, several hundreds of pipes remain in vacant homes. Additionally, not all residents have agreed to have their homes checked or their pipes replaced.

The city is required by law to replace all lead lines in the coming years. Residents who need their lead lines replaced can call 810-410-1133, or email GetTheLeadOut@cityofflint.com.

The city’s recovery could also be hampered by a loss in funding, as Michigan House Republicans voted to eliminate $8.3 million in funding to support services across the city, as the water crisis continues to impact residents and children.

Palisades nuclear plant returns to operating status

In West Michigan, the first nuclear plant restart in the nation has entered its final phase, with plans to bring two small modular reactors online at the same site.

While the plant has not yet returned to energy production, it has been cleared to bring new fuel on site.

However, a host of anti-nuclear groups continue to raise concerns about the safety of the restart, with a trio of organizations filing a federal lawsuit arguing the plant is legally barred from resuming operations after entering decommissioning status.

Energy emergency draws challenge from Michigan AG

Since its issuance on Jan. 20, the Trump Administration’s energy emergency order has drawn criticism from environmentalists across the nation, alongside a legal challenge from Michigan’s attorney general.

Despite record breaking energy production in 2024, the Trump administration has proclaimed the nation’s energy resources to be insufficient, though Nessel and Democratic attorneys general from 14 other states are arguing the order is unlawful.

In the lawsuit, the attorneys general argues the president’s powers are reserved for actual emergencies, and that the administration’s move to fast track permits for several activities tied to energy production undermine the rights of the states.

Alongside fast tracking the environmental review of the Line 5 tunnel project, the Trump Administration has used the order as a justification to repeatedly extend operations at a West Michigan Coal plant that was slated to close at the end of May.

According to the plant’s owner, Consumers Energy, keeping the plant online has cost the company $80 million between the initial extension issued on May 23, and Sept. 30. The latest extension, issued on Nov. 18, will keep the plant operating through Feb. 17, 2026. Nessel has challenged the extension.

Trump commits to supporting project to keep invasive carp out of the Great Lakes

A decades-long project aimed at keeping invasive carp from establishing a foothold in the Great Lakes, secured support from the White House in May, following efforts from the Whitmer administration to ensure the project would receive funding allocated under former President Joe Biden’s administration.

The $1.15 billion dollar project, which secured its first construction contract in December 2024, is a joint effort sponsored by Michigan, Illinois and the United States Army Corps of Engineers. The project targets a critical choke point near Joliet, Ill., instituting a series of deterrents to keep invasive carp and other nuisance species out of the Great Lakes.

The Michigan Department of Natural Resources warns that the carp could outcompete native species and greatly harm the ecology and economy of the entire Great Lakes region – including rivers and inland lakes – alongside the region’s $20 billion fishing and boating industries.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DSC_0417-2048x1365.jpg,N,,2026-01-01 11:59:26.832796

And in New Jersey and Virginia, Democrats “who are by no means radical leftists” ran successful campaigns focused on lowering utility costs, O’Hanlon said.
“We see them as real protagonists in the fight for what we [at the Climate and Community Institute] are calling ‘green economic populism,’” said Rithika Ramamurthy, communications director at the leftwing climate thinktank Climate and Community Institute.
And tenants’ unions are working to green their residences while protecting renters from climate disasters and rising bills, Ramamurthy said.
“The administration was great on connecting jobs and green energy,” she said.","A group of progressive politicians and advocates are reframing emissions-cutting measures as a form of economic populism as the Trump administration derides climate policy as a “scam” and fails to deliver on promises to tame energy costs and inflation.

Climate politics were once cast as a test of moral resolve, calling on Americans to accept higher costs to avert environmental catastrophe, but that ignores how rising temperatures themselves drive up costs for working people, said Stevie O’Hanlon, co-founder of the youth-led Sunrise Movement.

“People increasingly understand how climate and costs of living are tied together,” she said.

Utility bills and healthcare costs are climbing as extreme weather intensifies. Public transit systems essential to climate goals are reeling from federal funding cuts. Rents are rising as landlords pass along costs of inefficient buildings, higher insurance and disaster repairs, turning climate risk into a monthly surcharge. Meanwhile, wealth inequality is surging under an administration that took record donations from big oil.

“We need to connect climate change to the everyday economic reality we are all facing in this country,” said O’Hanlon.

Progressive politicians have embraced that notion. Zohran Mamdani, New York City’s democratic socialist mayor-elect, has advanced affordability-first climate policies such as free buses to reduce car use, and a plan to make schools more climate-resilient. Seattle’s socialist mayor-elect, Katie Wilson, says she will boost social housing while pursuing green retrofits.

Maine’s US Senate hopeful Graham Platner is pairing calls to rein in polluters and protect waterways with a critique of oligarchic politics. In Nebraska, independent US Senate candidate Dan Osborn backs right-to-repair laws that let farmers and consumers fix equipment – an approach he doesn’t frame as climate policy, but one that climate advocates say could reduce emissions from manufacturing. And in New Jersey and Virginia, Democrats “who are by no means radical leftists” ran successful campaigns focused on lowering utility costs, O’Hanlon said.

Movements nationwide are also working to cut emissions while building economic power. Chicago’s teachers’ union secured a contract requiring solar panels to be added to schools and creating clean-energy career pathways for students. Educators’ unions in Los Angeles and Minneapolis are also seeking to improve conditions for staff and students while decarbonizing.

“We see them as real protagonists in the fight for what we [at the Climate and Community Institute] are calling ‘green economic populism,’” said Rithika Ramamurthy, communications director at the leftwing climate thinktank Climate and Community Institute.

From Maine to Texas, organized labor is also pushing for a unionized workforce to decarbonize energy and buildings. And tenants’ unions are working to green their residences while protecting renters from climate disasters and rising bills, Ramamurthy said. From Connecticut to California, they are fighting for eviction protections, which can prevent post-disaster displacement and empower tenants to demand green upgrades. Some are also directly advocating for climate-friendly retrofits.

Movements are also working to expand public ownership energy, which proponents say can strengthen democratic control and lower rates by eliminating shareholder profits. In New York, a coalition won a 2023 policy directing the state-owned utility to build renewable energy with a unionized workforce, and advocates are pursuing a consumer-owned utility in Maine and a public takeover of the local utility in Baltimore.

To hold polluters accountable for their climate contributions, activists and lawmakers across the country are championing policies that would force them to help pay to curb emissions and boost resilience. Vermont and New York passed such “climate superfund” laws this year, while New York and Maine are expected to vote on such measures soon. And legislators in other states are looking to introduce or reintroduce bills in 2026, even as the Trump administration attempts to kill the laws.

“When insurance becomes unaffordable and states are constantly rebuilding after disasters, people don’t need some technical explanation to know that something is seriously wrong,” said Cassidy DiPaola, spokesperson for the Make Polluters Pay campaign. “Climate superfunds connect those costs to accountability by saying that the companies that caused the damage shouldn’t be shielded from paying for it.” Polls show the bills appear popular, she said.

Speaking to people’s financial concerns can help build support for climate policy, said DiPaola. Polls show voters support accountability measures against polluters and that most believe the climate crisis is driving up costs of living.

“The fastest way to depolarize climate is to simply talk about who’s paying and who’s profiting,” she said. “People disagree about a lot of things, but they do understand being ripped off.”

Linking green initiatives with economic concerns isn’t new. It was central to the Green New Deal, popularized by the Sunrise Movement and politicians like the representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in 2018. That push informed Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which included the biggest climate investments in US history. But critics argue the IRA fell short of building economic power among ordinary people.

Though it boosted green manufacturing and created some 400,000 new jobs, those benefits were not tangible to most Americans, said Ramamurthy. Proposed investments in housing and public transit – which may have been more visible – were scaled back in the final package. Its incentives also largely went to private companies and wealthier households. A 2024 poll found only 24% of registered voters thought the IRA helped them.

“The IRA focused on creating incentives for capital, relying almost entirely on carrots with very few sticks,” said Ramamurthy.

While it advanced renewables, the IRA also contained handouts for polluters, O’Hanlon said. And Biden did not pair its passage with messaging acknowledging economic hardship, she said.

“The administration was great on connecting jobs and green energy,” she said. “But they said the economy was doing well, which felt out of touch.”

Trump capitalized on Americans’ economic anxieties, said O’Hanlon, but has not offered them relief.

“We need a vision that can actually combat the narrative Trump has been putting out,” she said. “We need a vision for addressing the climate crisis alongside making life better for for working people.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/63c31ba1ccf48119ca7a861af1e53e9331976f7a/232_0_2501_2000/master/2501.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=7c6c4eb8cb6e7610eddee3d5d03b35c5",N,,2026-01-01 10:59:02.368022

Explore the latest innovations and strategy at General Motors Co

Market Pulse: Price, Trend and Technical Setting

According to real?time quotes from Yahoo Finance and cross?checked against Google Finance and Reuters, General Motors Co stock last closed at approximately 36.50 US dollars per share in the final trading session before the new year. Intraday data for the current session was not yet available at the time of research, so this last close is the operative reference point. Over the past five trading days, the stock has drifted modestly lower, giving back part of the strong rally it enjoyed earlier in the quarter.

Over this recent five?day stretch, GM shares have traded in a relatively tight band between roughly the mid?36s and just under 38 dollars, with two small down days outweighing a couple of hesitant rebounds. The short?term tape suggests some profit taking after a sharp move up in the prior weeks, rather than an outright collapse in conviction. Volume has cooled from the spike seen around major news on labor costs and Cruise, pointing to a short consolidation rather than panic selling.

Stepping back to a 90?day view, the stock is still comfortably in positive territory versus its early?autumn levels. GM has climbed from the high?20s to the mid?30s, helped by upbeat guidance revisions, aggressive share buybacks and the market’s broader pivot toward cyclical and value names as rate?cut hopes crept back into the macro narrative. The 52?week range crystallizes just how bruising the earlier part of the year was: the stock’s low sat around the high?20s, while its 52?week high reached into the low?40s. Trading in the mid?30s today leaves GM below the top of that range, but well off its trough, encapsulating a story of partial recovery with lingering skepticism.

One-Year Investment Performance

An investor who bought General Motors Co stock exactly one year ago at roughly 34.00 US dollars per share, and held through all the strikes, EV headlines and Cruise turbulence, would now be sitting on a modest gain with the stock around 36.50. That equates to a price return of about 7 to 8 percent, before any dividends. It is hardly the stuff of meme?stock legend, but in a year when auto names were routinely whipsawed by supply chain concerns, regulatory noise and demand jitters, it represents a quietly respectable outcome.

The emotional journey, however, was far from calm. At various points in the past twelve months, GM traded deep in the red versus that entry price, especially during the height of labor disputes and after high?profile setbacks at Cruise. For an investor, staying invested required a strong stomach and a clear thesis that GM’s cash?generating truck and SUV core could shoulder the weight of ambitious EV and software spending. Those who did not flinch are now modestly ahead, and if dividends are factored in, the total return looks slightly better than the bare share price suggests.

Still, the opportunity cost question lingers. Compared with the soaring returns in parts of the tech sector or niche EV winners during their hottest stretches, GM’s one?year payoff feels subdued. That contrast fuels an ongoing debate: is GM a patient investor’s compounding story in disguise, or is it fundamentally capped by its capital intensity and the political and regulatory headwinds facing the traditional auto industry?

Recent Catalysts and News

In the past few days, the GM news flow has been less about headline?grabbing product launches and more about execution details and cleanup operations in its advanced tech portfolio. After pausing most operations at Cruise following a high?profile pedestrian incident and regulatory scrutiny, GM has been busy reshaping the unit’s leadership and strategy. Fresh reporting from Reuters and other outlets pointed to leadership changes at Cruise and an intensified focus on safety culture and phased redeployment, signaling a desire to preserve the long?term autonomous opportunity while staunching reputational and financial damage in the near term.

Earlier in the week, investor attention gravitated toward GM’s capital allocation posture. Management has continued to signal commitment to sizeable share repurchases and a gradually more generous dividend, supported by robust profitability in its North American truck and SUV business. Commentary from financial media such as Bloomberg and CNBC highlighted how GM is trying to reassure shareholders that, despite rising labor costs following the latest union agreements, it can sustain healthy margins and return capital without derailing its multibillion?dollar EV roadmap.

At the product level, the latest stories have underscored a tactical recalibration rather than a wholesale retreat from EVs. Reports referenced GM’s decision to pace some EV launches and adjust production schedules, especially for higher?end models, in response to more cautious demand signals and a fiercely competitive pricing environment. This has been framed as an attempt to avoid overbuilding inventory and discounting too aggressively, even as the company pushes ahead with its Ultium battery platform and broadens its lineup from premium trucks and SUVs into more mass?market segments.

There has also been ongoing coverage of GM’s software and services strategy, from incremental over?the?air feature monetization to the evolution of subscription?based offerings. While none of these updates individually moved the stock dramatically in recent sessions, they collectively feed into the narrative that GM is trying to pivot from a purely hardware?driven business model toward a more recurring?revenue, data?driven ecosystem, even if investors continue to demand proof that these ambitions can materially shift the valuation needle.

Wall Street Verdict & Price Targets

Over the past month, several major investment banks have updated their views on General Motors Co, and their verdict skews cautiously constructive. Research notes from firms such as Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan and Bank of America, referenced in summaries on financial portals like Yahoo Finance and MarketWatch, generally carry Buy or Overweight ratings, with 12?month price targets clustered in the low to mid?40s. Relative to the current share price around 36.50, that implies double?digit upside if management can execute on its promises.

J.P. Morgan’s analysts, for example, have emphasized GM’s attractive earnings multiple compared with both the broader market and the automotive peer group, arguing that the stock discounts overly dire scenarios around EV profitability and ongoing labor cost inflation. Goldman Sachs has framed GM as a cyclical value play with embedded real options in EVs and autonomous driving, suggesting that even if those long?dated options do not fully pay off, investors are still buying a solid truck?led cash engine at a discount.

Not all commentary is unqualified praise. Some European houses, including Deutsche Bank, have maintained more neutral stances, with Hold or equivalent ratings. Their reservations often center on execution risk in scaling Ultium production, the pace of consumer EV adoption in a higher?rate environment and the uncertain trajectory of Cruise’s regulatory landscape. They also highlight that GM’s earnings remain highly concentrated in North America and especially in full?size pickup and SUV segments, leaving the company vulnerable if that profit pool comes under pressure.

Across these voices, a consensus picture emerges: Wall Street is not in love with GM, but it is increasingly willing to own it at the right price. The stock is largely framed as undervalued relative to its cash flow, with analysts eyeing potential upside from continued buybacks, margin defense in core trucks and incremental progress on EV and software monetization. At the same time, most research flags clear downside risks if EV margins disappoint further or if Cruise becomes a deeper financial drain than currently modeled.

Future Prospects and Strategy

General Motors Co today is a hybrid of old?school Detroit metal and next?generation mobility ambition. At its core, the company still makes its money from selling high?margin pickup trucks, SUVs and crossovers in North America, supported by a global but more volatile portfolio of brands. That legacy business throws off the cash needed to fund an aggressive pivot toward electric vehicles based on the Ultium battery platform, along with investments in software, connectivity and autonomous driving via Cruise and other initiatives.

In the coming months, the market will be watching three strategic levers. First is EV execution: can GM ramp production reliably, control warranty and quality issues, and bring battery costs down fast enough to preserve margins while still pricing competitively against Tesla and ambitious Chinese rivals? Second is cost discipline: after the recent union agreements, investors will scrutinize whether GM can offset higher labor expenses through efficiencies, mix management and disciplined capital spending. Third is credibility in high?tech bets: the company needs to show that Cruise can eventually return to controlled, safe growth and that in?vehicle software and services can create recurring revenue rather than being seen as a cost center.

If GM can thread that needle, the current share price could mark a staging ground for a more durable rerating, as the market begins to treat it less like a shrinking combustion?engine incumbent and more like a cash?rich transition story. However, if EV demand softens further, if regulatory scrutiny on autonomous driving intensifies or if a macro slowdown hits U.S. truck demand, the stock could slide back toward the lower end of its 52?week range. For now, GM remains a nuanced proposition: a value?tilted stock with cyclical sensitivity and high?beta optionality in EVs and autonomy, asking investors to balance healthy present?day profits against a future that is still very much under construction.",https://mdb.ad-hoc-news.de/bilder/bild-2404989_600_800.jpg,N,,2026-01-01 10:59:11.267962

In the waning days of 2025, the Trump administration delivered a dramatic intervention in the energy sector, issuing an emergency order to keep an aging coal-fired power plant in northwestern Colorado operational just one day before its scheduled shutdown. The Craig Station’s Unit 1, a facility long earmarked for retirement amid shifting economic and environmental pressures, was thrust back into the spotlight by a directive from the Department of Energy. This move, aimed at averting what officials described as a potential power emergency, underscores the administration’s unwavering commitment to bolstering coal as a cornerstone of U.S. energy security. Critics, however, decry it as a costly and environmentally regressive ploy that burdens ratepayers and delays the inevitable transition to cleaner alternatives.

The order, detailed in reports from Colorado Public Radio, mandates that the plant remain available beyond its December 31 retirement date. Federal energy officials justified the action by citing grid reliability concerns, particularly in the face of growing demands from data centers and extreme weather events. Yet, this isn’t an isolated incident; it fits into a broader pattern of interventions where the administration has repeatedly stepped in to extend the lifespans of coal plants across the country. For instance, earlier in the year, similar orders kept facilities in Indiana and other states online, as noted in coverage from The New York Times.

Environmental groups and local officials have responded with swift condemnation, arguing that the decision ignores the plant’s history of pollution and the economic realities driving its closure. In Colorado, where the push for renewable energy has gained significant traction, the order has sparked a backlash from state leaders who view it as federal overreach. According to The Colorado Sun, the plant’s operator had already invested in decommissioning plans, and the sudden reversal could impose millions in additional costs on consumers without addressing underlying grid vulnerabilities.

The Administration’s Coal Revival Strategy Takes Shape

This latest directive builds on a series of executive actions throughout 2025 that have systematically dismantled regulatory barriers to coal production and consumption. President Trump’s inauguration in January marked the beginning of a aggressive pivot toward fossil fuels, with policies designed to “unleash American energy” as a counter to what the administration portrays as burdensome environmental rules from previous years. A comprehensive overview in The Hill highlights how these changes include loosening emissions standards, extending toxic waste disposal timelines for coal ash, and allocating substantial federal funds to subsidize the industry.

One pivotal move came in September, when the administration announced a $625 million investment to revive coal operations, including opening 13.1 million acres of public land for mining. This initiative, reported by The Guardian, aims to counteract the rapid decline of coal’s role in U.S. electricity generation, which has plummeted from about 50% in 2000 to just 15% in 2024. Proponents argue that such measures are essential for maintaining energy independence, especially as global competitors like China continue to expand their coal fleets. Posts on X from users like those affiliated with pro-administration accounts emphasize this point, noting that while China added 243 coal plants in 2024, U.S. grid reliability has suffered under prior restrictive policies.

Beyond financial incentives, the administration has leveraged emergency powers under the Federal Power Act to mandate plant operations. The Craig order echoes a June intervention where coal and gas plants were kept open despite grid operators’ assertions that no such emergency existed, as detailed in another New York Times article. These actions have raised questions about the true motivations, with some industry analysts suggesting they serve more as political theater to fulfill campaign promises to coal-dependent communities than as genuine solutions to energy shortages.

Environmental and Economic Ramifications Unfold

The environmental toll of prolonging coal plant operations is a central point of contention. Coal combustion remains a major source of carbon emissions, particulate matter, and toxic pollutants, contributing to respiratory illnesses and climate change. Environmental advocacy groups, such as those quoted in a press release from Earthjustice, warn that the Craig extension will exacerbate air quality issues in rural Colorado, where communities have already borne the brunt of the plant’s emissions for decades. This comes at a time when renewable sources like wind and solar have surpassed coal in electricity production, signaling a market-driven shift that federal interventions may only temporarily delay.

Economically, the costs are equally stark. Ratepayers could face millions in additional expenses to keep outdated facilities running, including maintenance, fuel, and compliance with lingering regulations. Coverage from CNN estimates that similar orders elsewhere have already burdened consumers, with no clear benefits to grid stability. In Colorado, local economies tied to coal mining and power generation stand to gain short-term job preservation, but experts argue this hinders investment in retraining programs and renewable infrastructure that could provide more sustainable employment.

Moreover, the policy intersects with emerging demands from the tech sector. As AI data centers proliferate, requiring vast amounts of reliable power, the administration has positioned coal as a “critical mineral” to fuel this growth. Executive orders from April, as shared in posts on X by influential accounts, directed agencies to support coal production explicitly for these purposes, framing it as vital for national security. This narrative contrasts sharply with global trends toward decarbonization, where even coal-heavy nations are exploring transitions.

Policy Precedents and Legal Challenges Emerge

Tracing back, the Trump administration’s approach draws from earlier efforts to classify energy resources strategically. A November proposal from the Environmental Protection Agency, outlined in The Hill, sought to extend waste-disposal practices for coal plants, effectively granting them more time to operate without stringent upgrades. This regulatory relief is part of a larger rollback of Obama- and Biden-era rules, including carbon emission standards that the administration has moved to repeal without replacements, as highlighted in X posts criticizing the lack of plans for major pollution sources.

Legal battles are already brewing. Colorado officials and environmental litigants are preparing challenges, arguing that the emergency declaration lacks substantiation. Similar disputes over past orders have questioned whether the Department of Energy’s actions violate the Federal Power Act by imposing undue costs without operator requests. Reports from PostIndependent.com indicate that the Craig plant’s grid operator never sought the extension, fueling accusations of political interference.

Industry insiders note that these interventions could set precedents for future administrations, potentially politicizing energy reliability decisions. With coal’s market share eroding due to cheaper natural gas and renewables, such orders might deter private investment in modern infrastructure, perpetuating a cycle of dependency on federal bailouts.

Broader Implications for Energy Security and Innovation

Looking ahead, the administration’s coal-centric policies raise fundamental questions about America’s energy future. By prioritizing fossil fuels, they may undermine incentives for innovation in carbon capture, storage, and other technologies that could make coal more viable in a low-emission world. X posts from pro-coal advocates praise initiatives like the COAL POWER Act, which repeals prior EPA restrictions and invests in retrofitting, but critics counter that these funds could better support grid modernization and renewable integration.

In the context of international relations, this stance positions the U.S. as an outlier amid global efforts to phase out coal. While the administration touts energy dominance—echoed in executive orders guaranteeing protections for coal companies—the environmental community warns of long-term risks, including intensified climate impacts. Bloomberg’s analysis, referenced in X discussions, catalogs over 180 rollbacks in 2025 alone, from soot rules to particulate limits, painting a picture of aggressive deregulation.

For coal-dependent regions like northwestern Colorado, the order offers a temporary reprieve, preserving jobs in mining and operations. Yet, as detailed in WDBO, this comes at the expense of broader economic diversification. Communities are caught between immediate livelihoods and the promise of green jobs, with state initiatives for just transitions now complicated by federal mandates.

Navigating the Path Forward Amid Uncertainty

As 2026 dawns, the Craig plant’s fate symbolizes the tension between legacy industries and evolving energy needs. The administration’s actions, while fulfilling pledges to revitalize coal, invite scrutiny over their efficacy and equity. Will these orders truly enhance grid resilience, or merely postpone coal’s decline at great cost? Industry observers suggest that without complementary investments in transmission and storage, such measures risk isolating the U.S. from global clean energy advancements.

Environmental groups continue to mobilize, leveraging public sentiment evident in X posts decrying the “climate onslaught.” Legal avenues remain open, with potential court rulings that could curtail the use of emergency powers for industrial lifelines. Meanwhile, the tech-driven demand for power presents an opportunity to bridge divides, perhaps by hybridizing coal with renewables in innovative ways.

Ultimately, the Trump administration’s coal policies reflect a high-stakes bet on traditional energy sources amid rapid change. As debates intensify, the outcomes will shape not only Colorado’s horizons but the nation’s trajectory toward sustainable power. For now, the embers of coal burn on, fueled by political will and contested visions of progress.",https://www.webpronews.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/article-5240-1767248051.jpeg,N,,2026-01-01 13:13:20.347208

The president’s pursuit of energy dominance – despite the U.S. producing record levels of energy in 2024 – and his declaration of a widely disputed energy emergency sparked concerns among environmentalists and supporters of clean energy.

These moves also brought movement in the battle against Enbridge’s Line 5 pipeline, the state’s efforts to move away from coal power and encouraged the build out of data centers – which have faced widespread pushback from communities throughout the state.

With those stories in mind, the Advance is looking back on its biggest environmental stories of 2025.

______________________________________________________________________________________________

Data centers draw the ire of residents across the state

As a state law offering tax breaks on data center construction and equipment took effect earlier this year, tech companies are flocking to Michigan in hopes of building out additional facilities to advance artificial intelligence development while communities are increasingly pushing back against these projects.

In the past month, frustration from residents against the lack of transparency into many of these deals – with local officials and landowners bound by non-disclosure agreements – has hit a fever pitch with a few hundred residents gathering at the Michigan Capitol in Lansing to push back against these developments.

While regulations specific to data centers are limited to the conditions for receiving the tax break, lawmakers are stepping up to address their constituents’ concerns, with a bipartisan group of House representatives introducing legislation to repeal the tax breaks for these resource-intensive facilities.

Another group of lawmakers in the Senate has put forth regulations to bar entities withdrawing above an average of 2,000,000 gallons of water per day for consumptive use from obtaining a water withdrawal permit, require the Michigan Public Service Commission to publish reports on data centers’ energy and water use and ensure residents don’t bear the cost of upgrading water systems to serve these facilities.

Line 5 lawsuits continue as U.S. Army Corps of Engineers expedites review of tunnel project

Following a years-long legal battle over whether Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel’s case to remove Enbridge’s Line 5 pipeline from the Great Lakes should be heard in state or federal courts, the case returned to the Ingham County’s 30th Judicial Circuit Court in Lansing at the start of the year.

The United States Supreme Court has also agreed to hear an appeal of the decision that sent the case back to Michigan in the first place.

Additionally, attorneys for Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and the director of the Department of Natural Resources have asked the U.S. Supreme Court to review whether the state is immune from legal action for its decision to revoke Enbridge’s easement to operate the pipeline on the bottomlands of the Straits of Mackinac, where Lake Huron and Lake Michigan meet.

A decision to take up this case could carry even further weight, with a federal judge barring the state from enforcing its notice terminating Enbridge’s easement to operate Line 5 on the bottomlands of the Great Lakes.

In yet another legal challenge before the Michigan Supreme Court, justices agreed to review whether the Michigan Public Service Commission – which oversees siting matters for pipelines within the state – erred in its decision to issue one of the permits needed for Enbridge to begin construction on its tunnel project.

The state’s highest court will hear two challenges, one filed by FLOW Water Advocates, and another filed by the Bay Mills Indian Community, Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians, Little Traverse Bay Bands of Odawa Indians, and Nottawaseppi Huron Band of the Potawatomi. That case also includes several clean water and environmental advocates as plaintiffs, including the Michigan Climate Action Network and the Environmental Law & Policy Center.

Opponents argue the commission failed to make determinations required by the Michigan Environmental Protection Act, had improperly excluded evidence while considering the permit and failed to consider alternatives to the pipeline outside of the Straits of Mackinac.

Additionally, the Army Corps of Engineers’ long awaited environmental impact statement assessing the plan to replace the two segments of pipeline located in the Straits with a new segment placed in a tunnel embedded into the bedrock beneath the lake was issued in May.

An executive order issued by the Trump Administration in January has also permitted the project’s environmental review to move forward under a shortened timeline.

EPA lifts emergency order on Flint water, residents mark milestones on lead line replacement

More than 11 years after the beginning of the Flint Water Crisis, the United States Environmental Protection Agency lifted its emergency order on the city’s drinking water, which was put in place in 2016.

However, community members were quick to note that the decision, which came alongside the end of the city’s lead line replacement program, does not mean that the city’s pipes are lead free.

While Flint and the state of Michigan have met their obligations under a 2017 settlement requiring them to replace all lead lines in the city, several hundreds of pipes remain in vacant homes. Additionally, not all residents have agreed to have their homes checked or their pipes replaced.

The city is required by law to replace all lead lines in the coming years. Residents who need their lead lines replaced can call 810-410-1133, or email GetTheLeadOut@cityofflint.com.

The city’s recovery could also be hampered by a loss in funding, as Michigan House Republicans voted to eliminate $8.3 million in funding to support services across the city, as the water crisis continues to impact residents and children.

Palisades nuclear plant returns to operating status

In West Michigan, the first nuclear plant restart in the nation has entered its final phase, with plans to bring two small modular reactors online at the same site.

While the plant has not yet returned to energy production, it has been cleared to bring new fuel on site.

However, a host of anti-nuclear groups continue to raise concerns about the safety of the restart, with a trio of organizations filing a federal lawsuit arguing the plant is legally barred from resuming operations after entering decommissioning status.

Energy emergency draws challenge from Michigan AG

Since its issuance on Jan. 20, the Trump Administration’s energy emergency order has drawn criticism from environmentalists across the nation, alongside a legal challenge from Michigan’s attorney general.

Despite record breaking energy production in 2024, the Trump administration has proclaimed the nation’s energy resources to be insufficient, though Nessel and Democratic attorneys general from 14 other states are arguing the order is unlawful.

In the lawsuit, the attorneys general argues the president’s powers are reserved for actual emergencies, and that the administration’s move to fast track permits for several activities tied to energy production undermine the rights of the states.

Alongside fast tracking the environmental review of the Line 5 tunnel project, the Trump Administration has used the order as a justification to repeatedly extend operations at a West Michigan Coal plant that was slated to close at the end of May.

According to the plant’s owner, Consumers Energy, keeping the plant online has cost the company $80 million between the initial extension issued on May 23, and Sept. 30. The latest extension, issued on Nov. 18, will keep the plant operating through Feb. 17, 2026. Nessel has challenged the extension.

Trump commits to supporting project to keep invasive carp out of the Great Lakes

A decades-long project aimed at keeping invasive carp from establishing a foothold in the Great Lakes, secured support from the White House in May, following efforts from the Whitmer administration to ensure the project would receive funding allocated under former President Joe Biden’s administration.

The $1.15 billion dollar project, which secured its first construction contract in December 2024, is a joint effort sponsored by Michigan, Illinois and the United States Army Corps of Engineers. The project targets a critical choke point near Joliet, Ill., instituting a series of deterrents to keep invasive carp and other nuisance species out of the Great Lakes.

The Michigan Department of Natural Resources warns that the carp could outcompete native species and greatly harm the ecology and economy of the entire Great Lakes region – including rivers and inland lakes – alongside the region’s $20 billion fishing and boating industries.",https://cdn.newsfromthestates.com/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-86/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/dsc_0417-1024x6831767269007.jpg?h=199d8c1f&itok=EhQYPlYi,N,,2026-01-01 08:14:25.733685

As 2026 begins, data and market trends reveal a turning point, from early adoption to mainstream momentum. What do the numbers really say about India's EV drive?

Passenger Vehicle Boom Continues

India's electric passenger vehicle segment saw record growth in 2025, clocking over 1.6 lakh units sold between January and November, a 78 percent year-on-year surge. Leading automakers like Tata Motors, JSW-MG Motor, and Mahindra & Mahindra continued to shape this fast-evolving segment.

Globally, electric mobility maintained its upward curve, China achieved 50 percent EV penetration in auto sales, and worldwide, one in four vehicles sold was electric. Interestingly, emerging markets such as Thailand and Vietnam outpaced several advanced economies, even as Europe faced headwinds due to subsidy cuts and rising costs. The EU is reportedly rethinking its 2035 gasoline vehicle ban, showing how dynamic the global EV landscape now is.

Two-Wheelers Hit a Temporary Slowdown

On the two-wheeler front, the momentum slowed toward the end of 2025. A recent GST overhaul made traditional internal combustion commuter motorcycles cheaper, prompting a short-term slump in EV demand.

According to industry data, sales fell from around 1.43 lakh units in October to nearly 1.17 lakh in November, following a strong run earlier in the year. Still, market leaders such as TVS, Bajaj, Ather Energy, and Hero MotoCorp remain optimistic, especially as EV penetration in two-wheelers crossed the 5 percent mark in 2025, a significant milestone for the sector.

Launch Wave Keeps EV Buzz Alive

Manufacturers were relentless through 2025, introducing a slew of new products to maintain excitement and encourage wider adoption. From design innovations to improved range and performance, the competition intensified across price segments.

Major automakers, Mahindra, Tata Motors, and Hyundai, led from the front, while global EV giants like VinFast and Tesla signalled renewed confidence with their India plans. In 2026, analysts expect electric passenger vehicle penetration to hit double digits, driven by expanding model portfolios and enhanced charging availability.

The Road Ahead: Premium And Local

The two-wheeler space is now headed for a premium turn. Upcoming launches from Royal Enfield, Yamaha, and Ultraviolette promise to bring performance-oriented choices to the segment. Meanwhile, Maruti Suzuki's long-awaited e-Vitara is expected to enter the market soon, marking its first step into the EV space.

The EPA’s National Recycling Strategy identifies access gaps in underserved regions as key obstacles to achieving national recycling goals.","Despite decades of environmental policy and public awareness initiatives, recycling access in the United States remains highly uneven. While many urban centers benefit from established infrastructure for materials recovery and recycling, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency reports that a large share of rural and economically underserved communities lacks practical access to recycling services. This disparity undermines national sustainability goals and limits the economic potential of recovered materials.

According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the national recycling rate for plastics has stagnated at approximately 8.7, and most mixed plastics—especially resin types #3 through #7—are rarely recovered for reuse or remanufacture. Meanwhile, the National Academies’ Municipal Solid Waste Recycling in the United States report indicates that that could be recycled are instead lost due to insufficient regional infrastructure, prohibitive transport costs, and lack of accessible local processing capacity. These structural deficiencies result in millions of tons of recyclable waste being sent to landfills each year rather than being transformed into economically valuable products.

This access gap is particularly acute in the southeastern and midwestern United States, where counties often lack the population density and economic base necessary to support traditional recycling facilities. Such disparities reflect not a lack of public willingness to recycle but rather the absence of accessible, cost-effective processing options.

Why Traditional Recycling Models Don’t Work Everywhere

Traditional material recovery facilities (MRFs) operate on centralized models that depend on large, consistent volumes of feedstock, proximity to population centers, and substantial capital investment. These conditions tend to be met in large metropolitan areas but rarely in rural or economically distressed regions.

Several structural constraints challenge centralized recycling models:

Low population density diminishes the economies of scale needed to justify fixed facilities.

Long hauling distances raise the cost of transporting waste to distant MRFs, often exceeding the value of the recyclables themselves.

Limited municipal budgets restrict the ability of smaller jurisdictions to co-finance or maintain recycling infrastructure.

Lengthy permitting and construction timelines delay project deployment and raise overall costs.

These dynamics mean that even communities with a strong desire to participate in recycling are often unable to do so, not because they lack interest, but because existing systems are simply economically and logistically impractical for them.

The U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) has noted that expanding centralized facilities alone will not close the recycling access gap, [LINK ADDED] particularly for plastics and other hard-to-recycle materials.

What Decentralized and Mobile Recycling Models Offer

In the United States, a real-world example of decentralized recycling is the Mobile PET Plastic Ocean Waste Recycler pilot in Alaska. Developed with support from USDA NIFA SBIR and EPA SBIR programs, the project resulted in a transportable recycling unit deployed in multiple Alaskan communities. While the project concluded at the pilot stage without confirmed large-scale commercialization, it demonstrated the practical feasibility of mobile, community-level plastic recycling in regions lacking centralized infrastructure.

Mobile systems are generally modular and scalable, incorporating equipment for sorting, cleaning, and processing recyclable materials into usable forms.

For plastics #3 through #7, this might include recycling mixed waste to make construction products such as paving tiles, modular building components, or feedstock for secondary manufacturing.

The operational advantages of mobile recycling include:

Flexibility to serve multiple jurisdictions with a single unit,

Lower capital barriers compared to fixed infrastructure,

Adaptive deployment responding to local demand and seasonal changes,

Direct integration with existing municipal or commercial waste flows.

These characteristics make decentralized recycling especially suited to regions with variable waste volumes and limited access to conventional MRFs.

Environmental and Economic Benefits of Decentralized Recycling

Decentralized recycling models create measurable environmental and economic impacts. Environmentally, localized recycling reduces landfill dependence and associated greenhouse gas emissions from long-distance waste transport. Diverting plastics from landfills helps preserve limited landfill airspace and supports broader sustainability goals outlined in federal strategies like the EPA’s National Recycling Strategy.

Economically, mobile recycling expands local market activity by:

Creating jobs in operations, logistics, and materials handling;

Retaining material value within regional economies instead of exporting raw waste;

Supporting downstream industries that utilize recycled feedstocks;

Reducing long-term waste management costs for municipalities.

The analytical framework used by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), particularly the Regional Input-Output Modeling System (RIMS II), underscores how infrastructure investments generate direct, indirect, and induced economic impacts at the local and state levels. By enabling localized recycling capacity, decentralized models help catalyze these regional economic multipliers.

For example, a mobile unit capable of processing approximately 1,000 tons of mixed plastics annually contributes to waste diversion, local employment, and supply chain development without the need for extensive fixed facilities.

Practical Actions Communities Can Take

Local action is critical to lead national policy toward a distributed, effective recycling solution. Talk to your local representatives about projects that can set the example for the nation.

Pilot programs for mobile recycling units in areas identified as underserved or economically distressed.

Public–private partnerships to mitigate investment risks and share operational responsibilities.

Regional collaborations where clusters of counties share mobile units and associated infrastructure.

Integration with local industry by using recycled products in public works and construction projects.

Tapping state and federal resources, including EPA grants and programs authorized under the Recycling Infrastructure and Accessibility Act (RIAA), which emphasize accessibility in addition to capacity.

These steps allow communities to test and refine systems based on empirical data and demand, rather than speculative large-scale investments.

Why Decentralized Recycling Models Will Matter More in the Future

Federal policy momentum reflects a growing recognition of the limitations of traditional recycling infrastructure. The EPA’s National Recycling Strategy identifies access gaps in underserved regions as key obstacles to achieving national recycling goals. The Recycling Infrastructure and Accessibility Act similarly highlights the need for flexible, distributed solutions to meet evolving recycling targets.

As recycling goals rise nationally, such as the EPA’s target of a 50 percent recycling rate by 2030—mobile and decentralized models will become increasingly important. These systems are not intended to replace established MRFs but to complement them by closing geographic and economic gaps.

Steps Forward

The United States faces a structural recycling challenge: millions of tons of material that could be recycled are lost annually because existing infrastructure fails to serve large portions of the country. The problem is not one of public behavior but of system design.

Decentralized and mobile recycling models provide a practical, economically grounded solution to this challenge. By bringing processing capacity directly to underserved regions, these systems reduce landfill dependence, support local economies, and foster resilient regional supply chains. As national recycling goals evolve, flexible, scalable infrastructure solutions will play a central role in ensuring equitable recycling access and advancing sustainability

Since the 1950s, the marshes of Scotch Bonnet Island have lost more than 30% of their surface area to deluge.
“Whether it’s salt water or fresh water, wetlands really are the cornerstone to the whole system.”","This story is part of the WHYY News Climate Desk, bringing you news and solutions for our changing region.

From the Poconos to the Jersey Shore to the mouth of the Delaware Bay, what do you want to know about climate change? What would you like us to cover? Get in touch.

New Jersey is investing nearly $11 million to restore coastal salt marshes, including a major project at Scotch Bonnet Island in Cape May County.

Tidal salt marshes mitigate the effects of incoming waves and reduce flooding in the area, while storing climate-changing carbon. Birds, reptiles and fish also rely on these wetlands to survive and thrive.

But tidal salt marshes are drowning as they face rapidly rising sea level at a rate faster than they can handle. As a result, the marsh grasses are growing more slowly and are being replaced by mudflats.

Since the 1950s, the marshes of Scotch Bonnet Island have lost more than 30% of their surface area to deluge. In the last five years, the salt marsh trail has flooded on average almost 70 times each year.

A new $2.7 million state grant will help the Wetlands Institute in Stone Harbor restore tidal wetland vegetation at Scotch Bonnet Island to address the impacts of sea level rise.

“As you increase storm impacts and reduce marshes, it’s a double whammy,” said Lenore Tedesco, executive director of the institute. “Maintaining these nature-based solutions or natural features that are supporting us and helping us is really going to be important.”

Scotch Bonnet Island is one of three sites to receive funding from the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection totaling almost $11 million.

The grants are part of the state’s Natural Climate Solutions program, which aims to mitigate the effects of greenhouse gas emissions. Gov. Phil Murphy’s administration has dedicated more than $54 million to the program, which is funded through the state’s participation in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative.

The most recent round of funding includes $3 million to help Montclair State University plant 910 trees to sequester carbon and filter air and water pollutants. Another $5 million will help Stafford Township in Ocean County restore 23 acres of tidal salt marsh.

“New Jersey communities are harnessing nature-based solutions to restore and protect the integrity of coastal and forest ecosystems which serve as critical carbon sinks that reduce our greenhouse gas emissions,” DEP Commissioner Shawn LaTourette said in a statement. “These investments also improve natural buffers such as wetlands and urban forests that protect communities and infrastructure from flooding and increasingly more severe storm impacts as a result of our changing climate.”

The Wetlands Institute, in partnership with the Borough of Avalon, will use the grant to raise the salt marsh trail at Scotch Bonnet Island by about 2 to 3 feet. The institute will also replant the area with hundreds of native marsh vegetation and restore nesting habitat for diamondback terrapins and coastal birds.

The funding comes as the Environmental Protection Agency proposes changes to the definition of “waters of the United States” that would limit the types of waterways protected under the Clean Water Act.

The change would codify a 2023 U.S. Supreme Court decision that removed federal protections for wetlands that are either seasonal or aren’t connected to streams, lakes, rivers and oceans. Specifically, the revisions establish that protected waterways must be “navigable” or have a continuous water connection, making some types of wetlands vulnerable to development.

In New Jersey, property owners can’t fill, dredge or build on a wetland without a permit. Other states like Delaware have more limited wetland laws.

“Whether it’s water supply, whether it’s for irrigating crops, for people’s drinking water, we don’t have enough, and it’s getting more and more critical. At the same time, during storms we have too much water,” Tedesco said. “Whether it’s salt water or fresh water, wetlands really are the cornerstone to the whole system.”",https://whyy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/new-jersey-coastal-salt-marshes-2.jpg,N,,2026-01-01 09:57:29.419655

“I’m much more concerned about damage that will happen rather than achieving anything new and good,” said Sarah Lynn Cunningham, co-founder and executive director of the Louisville Climate Action Network. “I feel more like we’re in a defensive posture to prevent regression.”

From conservative lawmakers worried about Kentucky’s energy industries to people like Cunningham fighting society-driven climate change, they all agree the biggest issue coming before the legislature in the new year will be what to do about the resource-intensive data centers tech companies are hungry to build as they invest in artificial intelligence.

But they say other proposals on energy and the environment are also likely to come up as the General Assembly begins work in January.

‘A pretty good record’

This year legislators will approve a new, two-year budget for the state government, and environmental advocates hope they’ll spend extra on conservation efforts.

A report from The Nature Conservancy compared Kentucky to 11 “peer states” and found it lags in estimated annual conservation funding. At about $2.4 million, the report said Kentucky fell $9.1 million behind the next-lowest contributor: Indiana, at $11.5 million.

Conservation projects can serve multiple purposes, from shoring up a town against future floods to opening up green spaces for recreation to shielding water resources needed by residents and businesses, said Nick Hart, water policy director for the Kentucky Waterways Alliance.

“There's data out there that shows that every $1 spent for conservation funding and flood resilience returns back to us threefold in economic development,” he said.

Senator Robby Mills, a Henderson Republican who chairs the Senate’s majority caucus, indicated conservative lawmakers are open to discussing how to better support conservation efforts.

“But I think we have a pretty good record on conservationism. And if opportunities availed itself, I wouldn't say that we would shy away from it. We’d look at it,” he said.

‘Aggressive assault’

In 2025, the legislature ended a decades-old tradition in Kentucky of giving state-level protections against pollution to basically all waters in the commonwealth.

Under a new law, Senate Bill 89, the state mostly follows the federal government’s lead on which waters to safeguard. The law’s Republican supporters said this will reduce unnecessary red tape burdening businesses.

Meanwhile, the Trump administration announced in November that it wants to reduce the types of waterways that qualify for Clean Water Act protection. For example, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency estimates less than 15% of Kentucky wetlands would stay shielded.

“I would like to think that this aggressive assault on the integrity of what remains of our wetlands would sort of spur some folks to revisit the fact that we’ve entirely laid ourselves bare,” said Michael Washburn, executive director of the Kentucky Waterways Alliance.

But Republican lawmakers likely aren’t interested in taking up that issue again, at least so soon after passing SB 89. Mills said he expects legislators and their staff to watch what happens with federal regulations over the next year.

Similarly, Senator Scott Madon, a Pineville Republican who was SB 89’s lead sponsor, said he isn’t interested in revisiting the law in 2026 and thinks Gov. Andy Beshear’s administration could do a better job implementing it.

He pointed to Beshear’s claim that the state required an extra $1.8 million annually for staff to review water permit renewals under the new rules.

“Well, we never did really understand what he needed 1.8 for,” Madon said.

Going nuclear

It’s a safe bet some Republican lawmakers’ interest in nuclear energy will persist.

Mills said he sees continued support of coal and other fossil fuels as a bridge to get Kentucky to a future that’s powered significantly by nuclear energy.

“If there were targeted investments that we could make as a legislature to help our fossil fuel plants continue to burn for another 10 or 15 years, those could be investments that you see,” he said.

Madon said he’s afraid a day is coming when enough coal won't be available. Kentucky must diversify its energy portfolio, like states that are mixing solar, wind, gas and other power sources.

“I'm not saying anything against coal. I just think we need some other avenues to go along with our coal,” he said.

PFAS, tires, invasives

Advocates from environmental groups listed off various legislative proposals they hope will gain momentum this year.

Hart of the Kentucky Waterways Alliance, for example, said the legislature ordered the state government to produce a report with recommendations on how to tackle the vehicle tires that litter streams. They expect it will lead to concrete policy proposals.

Lane Boldman, executive director of the Kentucky Conservation Committee, said she hopes lawmakers will advance legislation to create a working group on PFAS, the so-called “forever chemicals” leaked into environments worldwide, and require manufacturers to disclose details when they add PFAS to products.

She and other environmental advocates also say they’d like to see progress on proposals to fight the spread of invasive plant species and stop utilities from cutting power during extreme weather to customers with overdue bills.

They’re also wary of possible budget cuts to the Kentucky Energy and Environment Cabinet and the Public Service Commission.

Both agencies historically have been understaffed, but their work is needed to meet obligations under U.S. environmental laws and take action when people break the rules on, say, pollution limits, said Audrey Ernstberger, an associate attorney with the Kentucky Resources Council.

“We want to make sure that these agencies continue to have reasonable amounts of funding to do their jobs,” she said.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/4116845/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4032x2117+0+454/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fa1%2F11%2Fa9b31f9749878e9b24804b8f157a%2Fimg-4497.jpg,N,,2026-01-01 09:57:33.451000

Democratic Rep. Jason Crow’s focus is on the mid-term elections and Democrats retaking the House.","Congress returns in early January, and members of Colorado’s congressional delegation each have their own priorities for the new year.

Democratic Sen. Michael Bennet said accessible health care will remain a top priority.

“I have not given up on extending the premium tax credits, and I have introduced legislation to create a public option for Americans who want a Medicare-administered plan. I will also continue to fight to protect our public lands,” he said in a statement.

Congress failed to renew the enhanced premium tax credit for those who buy health insurance on the state ACA marketplace. But a bipartisan group of lawmakers is still trying to get it passed in the new year.

GOP Rep. Jeff Hurd from the 3rd Congressional District is hoping an extension of the tax credit includes some reforms. Still, he said in the new year, Republicans and Democrats need to be talking about “how to lower the cost of healthcare.”

Democratic Sen. John Hickenlooper also said he’ll focus on affordability and health care. He’s got a bipartisan bill that would make health care costs more transparent. “But also, we’ve got to look at how are we going to make this economy better and grow again without tariffs that works for everyone.”

The two senators also said they’d remain vigilant against Republican attempts to sell off public lands.

GOP Rep. Gabe Evans, who represents the 8th Congressional District, said he’s hoping the cost of living takes center stage when Congress comes back. He pointed out Colorado is one of the most expensive states and is focused on “doing everything that we can at the federal level to roll back these suffocating leftist regulations that are crushing our economy.”

An example he gave is his bipartisan FIRE Act, which ensures states aren’t punished for smoke and emissions they cannot control.

Democratic Rep. Brittany Pettersen of the 7th Congressional District also had addressing costs as her priority. She’s focused on housing and investing in kids and childcare.

""There’s 10,000 women who say they want to be in the workforce, but they can’t afford child care in Colorado. So it’s a huge issue,"" she said.

Many Colorado lawmakers’ priorities are focused close to home.

Hurd said his local issues for the new year include getting $40 million from the Interior Department for the Shoshone water rights, as well as serious legislation on public safety, economic development and Indian health service through.

Democratic Rep. Joe Neguse of the 2nd Congressional District said he wants to deliver results for Coloradans. “That means getting these bills on wildfire mitigation, watershed protection across the finish line in the same way that we did the Secure Rural Schools program.”

And while he criticized the first year of the 119th Congress for being one of the most “dysfunctional and unproductive,” his goal is to get as many of his bills signed into law as he can. (Neguse noted the longest government shutdown, where the House was out of session for more than seven weeks, and the low number of bills signed into law.)

GOP Rep. Lauren Boebert of the 4th Congressional District, however, points to successes out of the Republican-controlled Congress, such as their tax and spending bill, the One Big Beautiful Bill, and from the Trump Administration’s actions to control the border.

And unlike some of her other Republican colleagues, she’s not giving up on getting a second reconciliation bill passed. It’s a budget maneuver that allows the Senate to bypass the filibuster and is how the OBBB got passed.

Still, she also wants to see some of her bills get over the finish line. Her bill to delist the Gray Wolf from the Endangered Species Act and to establish new zip codes are both now in the Senate. She and Colorado’s senators will also have to address President Trump’s veto of the Finish the AVC Act and see if there is any appetite from Republican congressional leaders to try and override the veto or include it in a larger piece of legislation.

And Boebert noted that Congress still needs to figure out how to fund the government by January 30. “Is it going to be an omnibus? A minibus? I'm not sure exactly what it's going to look like, but we've got to get focused on this because there are amazing projects in my district that I want to see funded.”

Some others, however, are also looking at the big picture.

“I think next year my priority is going to be standing up for democracy and fighting against Donald Trump's illegal abuse of our system,” said Democratic Rep. Diana DeGette of the 1st Congressional District.

Democratic Rep. Jason Crow’s focus is on the mid-term elections and Democrats retaking the House.

“Things are getting substantially worse for Americans, so we have to establish a check. We have to reestablish some sanity [in Congress], which is why retaking control of the majority and reestablishing that check and balance and reasserting Congress's authority over many issues [is important],” Crow explained.

He thinks a change in leadership in the House could also help some of his legislative priorities, like campaign finance reform, gun violence prevention and affordable health care, move forward.

GOP Rep. Jeff Crank of the 5th Congressional District declined to speak with CPR News about his priorities.

Getting anything big passed this year will likely hit a big speed bump: the mid-term elections.

Colorado officials criticized the Trump administration order as a disservice to electricity users.
The power plant was completed in 1980.","The Trump administration has told another coal-fired power facility to remain open, this time ordering the owners of a Colorado electricity generating unit to keep it running beyond its Wednesday retirement date.

Compliance will cost Tri-State Generation and Transmission Association and the other owners of the Craig Station power plant in northwestern Colorado. The plant owners will need to fix a broken valve that put the power plant's 446-megawatt Unit 1 out of operation on Dec. 19, Tri-State said in a statement.

The order from Energy Secretary Chris Wright follows recent Department of Energy moves to keep coal-fired power stations open in Indiana, Washington state and Michigan despite efforts by their owners to close them.

It’s part of President Donald Trump’s push to revive the U.S. coal industry at a time when many utilities are shifting to cheaper, less-polluting energy sources such as natural gas and renewables. The administration, meanwhile, has blocked renewable energy, including wind power.

The 45-year-old generator in Colorado, one of three at Craig Station, had been scheduled to close at the end of 2025.

“As a not-for-profit cooperative, our membership will bear the costs of compliance with this order unless we can identify a method to share costs with those in the region,” Tri-State CEO Duane Highley said in the statement.

The power plant's owners had been planning since 2016 to shut down Unit 1 for economic reasons and to comply with “numerous state and federal requirements.”

Asked how much returning the unit to operation would cost and how long that would take, Tri-State spokesperson Amy Robertson said by email that the utility had no further information to share.

The generator must remain operational to address a shortage of electricity and electrical generation in the northwestern U.S., Wright wrote in Tuesday's emergency order keeping the unit operational.

“The Trump Administration is committed to lowering energy costs and keeping American families safe,” Wright said in a release.

Wade Gerber, who works at the power plant, said the announcement changes little for Colorado’s coal country, which is undergoing a long-term shift away from the fossil fuel as a pillar of the local economy.

He sees Craig — a city of about 9,000 people — as caught in the middle of a dizzying political battle.

“What does this administration get to do? What does the next administration get to do? Is it going to make (coal) any long-term thing? No, probably not,” Gerber said.

Gerber recently opened a distillery that caters to the cocktail lounge his wife owns next door, with plans to begin distributing more widely in 2026.

“I already told both my bosses, if that blows up even a little bit, I can tell you: ‘Here’s my two-week notice,’” Gerber said.

Colorado officials criticized the Trump administration order as a disservice to electricity users.

“It is unacceptable to burden ratepayers with these unnecessary costs,” Democratic U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet said in a statement.

The power plant was completed in 1980. Its No. 2 and No. 3 units have been scheduled to be retired in 2028. The plant’s fuel is mined at the nearby Trapper Mine, which is also scheduled to close.

Americans across nearly every region of the country are paying more to keep the lights on and the heat running, according to a new nationwide analysis that shows electric and natural gas rate increases spreading deeper into households from coast to coast.

“There are several reasons why utilities are raising rates so rapidly, including the need to modernize the aging electric grid, which has been burdened by extreme weather events made more frequent and costly due to climate change and growing energy demand due to artificial intelligence data centers,” Center for American Progress (CAP) researchers declared. “At the same time, higher natural gas costs and a policy assault on new clean energy generation from the Trump administration are driving energy costs even higher.”

An updated utility rate tracker released by the CAP in collaboration with the Natural Resources Defense Council shows that roughly two out of every three electric customers and more than six in ten natural gas customers are now facing higher bills. The increases affect more than 108 million electricity customers and nearly 49 million natural gas customers across 49 states and Washington, D.C., with total added costs approaching $85.8 billion by 2028.

Federal data shows that the financial pressure is already being felt. Average household electricity bills in 2025 are running 9.6 percent higher than in 2024, rising faster than wages and overall inflation. The analysis identifies at least 222 electric and natural gas utilities that have already implemented rate hikes, received approval for increases, or are seeking new increases through 2027.

The impact varies sharply by state. In Missouri, some households are seeing monthly electricity increases exceeding $45, while parts of Massachusetts and Arkansas face projected increases of more than $30 a month. In Texas, customers served by multiple utilities are absorbing monthly increases ranging from single digits to more than $20, depending on provider and region. Florida electric customers in some service areas are seeing increases above $30 per month, while households in Michigan, Virginia, and Ohio are facing steady upward adjustments tied to both electric and natural gas service.

The report points to several drivers behind the rising costs. Utilities across the country are investing billions to upgrade aging infrastructure, much of it stressed by extreme weather and rising demand. At the same time, growing electricity consumption from artificial intelligence data centers is placing additional strain on regional grids. The analysis also links higher costs to federal policy decisions that have slowed the expansion of new clean energy generation, limiting supply options and increasing long-term system expenses.

Natural gas customers are experiencing parallel pressures. Higher fuel costs and infrastructure spending are pushing bills upward in states such as Pennsylvania, New York, Kentucky, and Maryland, where monthly gas increases now exceed $10 in some service territories. The report warns that winter heating demands combined with higher rates increase the risk of missed payments and service shutoffs, particularly for low-income households.

The tracker is based on filings with state public utility commissions, utility company disclosures, and federal energy data. Researchers note that the list is not exhaustive and will continue to grow as additional rate cases move through regulatory approval.

The latest analysis shows that rate increases already approved or proposed will raise electricity customer bills by $67.7 billion and natural gas customer bills by $18.1 billion nationwide by the end of the decade, affecting households in nearly every state.",https://northdallasgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/gas-meter-snow-covered-cleared.jpg,N,,2026-01-01 14:12:37.695735

Not so fast, state environmental officials are reminding Rhode Islanders, as even after trees stop sparkling, they can still contribute something to the world.

The Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management and the Rhode Island chapter of Trout Unlimited will hold their annual “Trees for Trout” collection on Saturday, Jan. 10, from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. at the Arcadia Check Station.

The check station is located in the Wood River Arcadia Management Area at 2224 Ten Rod Road in Exeter.

Since 2018, DEM and Trout Unlimited, a national nonprofit that works to conserve rivers to nurture fish populations, have collected Christmas trees to build conifer revetments in the state’s freshwater habitats. The revetments act like retaining walls and are used to build up the eroding banks of rivers, which can make rivers too wide and shallow to serve as suitable breeding and living grounds for fish, especially wild brook trout, or Salvelinus fontinalis.

A 2021 article by DEM noted numerous poor land use practices that lead to these suboptimal waters: “Dams create barriers and discharge warm water to the otherwise cold stream below. Cattle trample stream banks causing instability, sedimentation and high nutrient run off. Clearcutting removes trees and brush which otherwise filter water before reaching a stream. And the list goes on.”

Building up the river banks with revetments helps to mimic the natural shape and habitat of rivers. The revetments are fashioned by bundling together several dozen conifer trees with stakes and biodegradable twine. The bundled trees are then attached along riverbanks and extend into the channel, where the trees help to stem the flow of water, trapping sediment, sands, and other organic matter over time. As the dead trees build their detritus collections, they form new chunks of riverbank.

Conifers are evergreen trees that bear cones, and this group of trees includes most of the popular Christmas tree choices like firs, pines and spruces. The trees’ densely needled, many-branched bodies provide the perfect surface to fortify riverbanks against erosion.

“Conifer revetments help to narrow the river channel and confine the flow so that during low flows, there is deeper water, thereby creating more habitat for fish,” the DEM article noted.

Trees eligible for use in the trout project need to follow a few rules from DEM to be donated:

Only real trees can be used. Artificial or fire-retardant trees are not allowed.

All ornaments, decorations, stands and lights need to be removed.

Whole conifer trees are needed, so trimmings or clippings can’t be donated.

Trees over 5 feet tall are preferable.

People who want to drop off five or more trees will need to email Rhode Island Trout Unlimited in advance of the Jan. 10 event.

Other options and guidance for Christmas tree disposal can be looked up online via the website of the Rhode Island Resource Recovery Corporation, the quasi-public agency which runs the state’s Johnston landfill.

Gurugram (Haryana) [India], January 1: On a morning in New Delhi, the Bharat Mobility Global Expo buzzed with the familiar hum of India's automotive giants. Visitors wandered between displays of combustion engines and gleaming show cars, the kind of scene Delhi has hosted for decades. But in one corner of the hall, the crowd slowed. Two premium compact electric SUVs sat under the lights, the VF 6 and VF 7, their sharp V-shaped signatures glowing long before anyone registered the name on the stand.

VinFast's debut in India on Jan 17 of last year caught even veteran showgoers off guard. The company had brought right-hand drive versions tailored specifically for Indian consumers, a quiet signal that it was here with purpose, not testing the waters. Still, few in the hall recognized the badge. Amid the hum of announcements and clicking shutters, one visitor leaned toward a friend and asked, ""Who are these people?""

That question did not hang in the air for long. In the weeks that followed, a group of Indian journalists traveled to Vietnam to see where the cars came from. What they discovered in the northen city of Hai Phong reframed everything.

""I had no idea VinFast is such a big group,"" auto journalist Swati Agrawal recalled. ""I saw the factory, the manufacturing plant, and not only cars, even scooters, buses, electric buses. Everything is being manufactured in one place. Three lakh cars per year. This is not a small brand.""

Her reaction points to a deeper story. VinFast's sudden visibility in India is not merely an export push. It is the latest chapter in Vietnam's own industrial transformation, one that has accelerated quickly enough to catch even Asia's seasoned automotive observers off guard.

A 400-Acre Factory... From Nothing

By the time the expo lights dimmed, the next act of VinFast's India story had already begun taking shape in Tamil Nadu months earlier.

To choose a location for its plant, the company surveyed fifteen sites across six states. Tamil Nadu, with its manufacturing-ready infrastructure and active support for green mobility initiatives, rose to the top. What happened next showed how the brand like to act. And it's right there in the name: Fast.

In late February 2024, when the groundbreaking ceremony began on a sun soaked, low lying tract of land near Thoothukudi, the site was still empty. By Aug 4, 2025, it housed India's newest electric vehicle factory, a 400-acre complex with body shop, paint shop, general assembly, logistics warehouse, and supplier-ready zones.

""We entered India with nothing,"" CEO Pham Sanh Chau said at the inauguration ceremony. ""No land. No factory. No team. The only thing we had was a deep resolve and a belief that this area could become a leading hub for electric vehicles and auto components in South Asia."" He gestured to the plant behind him. ""In just fifteen months, we transformed this land into a modern, highly-automated factory.""

When the first VF 6 and VF 7 rolled out that morning, they were the first VinFast vehicles to be made-in-India, by the hands and minds of Indian people, for Indian customers. ""They are a symbol of the aspirations and resilience of the Indian people as they reach for a better, cleaner future,"" Chau said.

The plant is expected to create 3,000-3,500 direct jobs and several thousand more across the supply chain as auxiliary partners move into the region. Suppliers have already expressed readiness to relocate workshops near the factory, a sign of confidence in Thoothukudi's rise as an automotive production base.

In parallel, VinFast's India team has moved quickly to build the retail and service backbone that can make or break an EV brand in this market. By end of 2025, the company had opened 35 dealerships, stretching from Delhi, Gurugram and Noida in the north to Mumbai, Pune, Chennai, Bengaluru, Kochi and Hyderabad.

Yet the most unusual part of the ecosystem lies in aftersales support. VinFast partnered with RoadGrid, myTVS and Global Assure with the aim of creating a full-fledged third-party service centers before the first customer deliveries. Global Assure will operate a round the clock helpline, roadside assistance and mobile service. RoadGrid and myTVS will handle charging, maintenance and diagnostics, including support in areas where VinFast does not yet have a showroom.

For a country where questions about EV service often outweigh questions about EV design, this infrastructure may prove decisive.

Financing, long a barrier for EV adoption in India, has also been addressed through agreements with major banks including HDFC Bank, Yes Bank, Axis Bank, and others. These arrangements offer everything from dealer inventory financing to 100 percent on-road customer loans, with bank officers stationed directly in showrooms for simplified approval.

""This is how you support an EV transition,"" one banker at the Chennai showroom launch said. ""You do not just sell cars. You build systems.""

And in the months since customer deliveries began, VinFast has quietly climbed into the ranks of India's top electric vehicle brands. Industry registration data shows the company already placing among the country's top 10 EV brands, a notable shift for a name that was unfamiliar to most Indians at the start of the year. Its early momentum, built on steady deliveries and expanding visibility on the roads, has reinforced what many analysts have begun to observe.

""I love one thing about Vingroup,"" Swati says. ""They know what they are doing. And if they have a plant in India, people will think you are not going to just sell the product and leave."" She adds, ""In India, if you give good price, good range, and good service, the customers are yours.""

Why this first year matters

The rollout of Made-in-India VF 6 and VF 7 has already begun shifting industry perception. In April 2025, ABP Live named the VF 7 ""Most Awaited New Car,"" praising its design and advanced features. At the Jagran Hi-Tech Awards later in the year, VinFast was named ""EV Manufacturer of the Year"", and the VF 7 won ""EV Disruptor of the Year"".

""VinFast embodies the spirit of innovation and progress driving India's EV transformation,"" said Jagran's auto editor Arjit Garg. He commented that the company has displayed a rare clarity of direction for a newcomer and a ""people-first vision"" that aligns with India's long-term mobility goals.

VinFast's long-term commitment became even more visible on Dec 4, 2025, when VinFast signed a new MOU with the Government of Tamil Nadu to expand its Thoothukudi facility by an additional 200 hectares. The second-phase investment will add production lines for electric buses, e-scooters and charging infrastructure, deepening localization and strengthening India's emergence as a regional manufacturing hub. For many observers, the expansion underscored that the company's commitment runs far beyond its initial launch.

With the factory inaugurated, dealerships opening, service networks activating and customers already booking, VinFast enters 2026 as a steady companion in India's electric transition, intent on growing with the country.

Indian visitors to Vietnam say the brand's trajectory feels familiar yet refreshing. Piyush, a journalist and content creator, thinks back to the sight of VinFast cars filling Vietnam's streets. ""I can imagine something similar happening in India,"" he says. ""Maybe after five or six years.""

The New York banking giant is working with real estate advisory Newmark Group Inc. to raise both equity and credit for the project building modular natural gas-fired generation serving a cluster of south Dallas data centers, according to developer GridFree AI. Newmark has also been tapped as the exclusive marketer and advisor for the data hub, called South Dallas One.

The aim in this initial round is to raise ""hundreds of millions of dollars"" with more rounds as the first project is scaled up, according to Philip Krim, chief executive officer of Montauk Capital, which incubated GridFree AI.

Goldman declined to comment.

The US power system, which is based on Thomas Edison's 19th century grid, is struggling to meet the electricity needs of the modern economy. Aging infrastructure is being strained by extreme weather and unprecedented demand growth. Consumers are faced with a double whammy of rising power bills and a greater threat of blackouts in large parts of the US.

""Edison's grid was not built for the scale and size of these data centers,"" said Krim. ""We ended up saying, 'Let's start a company for energy experts to build a data center - knowing how energy-dense and energy-hungry data centers are - to scale up the AI buildout.'""

GridFree AI was formed about a year ago with Ralph Alexander as CEO. Alexander, a nuclear engineer, previously served as the top executive at Talen Energy Corp., where he led the development of a data center campus next to the independent power producer's Susquehanna nuclear plant in Pennsylvania. Amazon Web Services bought that campus early last year, which was expanded this year into a 1.92 gigawatt supply contract with Talen. This co-location deal quickly became the major flash point in making sure tech giants pay for their fair share of power plants and grid infrastructure without shifting those costs to other consumers.

""South Dallas One represents the future of AI-ready infrastructure: fast to deploy, resilient by design, and insulated from the grid constraints holding back the industry,"" Alexander said in an statement.

With land for two of the three sites secured, GridFree said initial power can be brought online in less than 24 months from the lease being signed, significantly faster than waiting to connect to the Texas grid. Each site will have about 1.5 gigawatts of power with structures to house data centers. The plan is to build 100-megawatt modules - 10 gas turbines providing around-the-clock power and two for back-up - so they can be quickly plugged into projects, Krim said.

This set-up can be done on 500 acres and will use the one household's worth of water because waste heat from power generation will be captured to help with cooling needs, he said.

While these AI campuses will be self-reliant, the goal is to ultimately connect to the Texas grid to supply spare power, Krim said. Fuel for the gas plants will be supplied by two pipelines, including one owned by Energy Transfer LP, and no back-up diesel generators will be needed, Krim said.

General Motors Co stock insights, products and corporate strategy at General Motors Co

Market Pulse and recent price action

Based on cross checked data from major financial portals, including Yahoo Finance and Reuters, the latest available quote for General Motors Co stock corresponds to the most recent market close. US equity markets were not trading on the reference day, so the figure represents the last close rather than an intraday price. That close leaves GM roughly in the mid range of its recent 52 week band, well above its yearly low but still meaningfully below the high watermark that briefly ignited hopes for a sustained rerating.

Over the last five trading sessions, the stock has moved in modest increments, alternating between small gains and pullbacks. The resulting pattern is a shallow upward slope over the week, barely outpacing the broader US auto and components group. Daily volumes have hovered around or slightly below their 90 day average, a signal that institutional investors are watching rather than aggressively repositioning.

Zooming out to the last 90 days, GM has staged a more visible recovery from earlier-year weakness. After carving out a bottom not far from its 52 week low, the stock climbed steadily as investors responded to disciplined cost control, resilient US truck and SUV demand and a more measured electrification roadmap. The 90 day trend is mildly bullish, yet the trajectory has flattened in recent weeks, suggesting that the easy rebound from pessimistic levels may be over and that fresh catalysts are needed.

In terms of trading boundaries, the latest data show a 52 week high that reflects the market’s most optimistic moment about GM’s ability to convert its internal combustion engine cash cows into an electric and software ecosystem. The 52 week low, by contrast, came when concerns over pricing pressure, EV adoption speed and union related cost inflation dominated the narrative. Today’s last close sits comfortably above that low but is still at a discount to the peak, keeping the valuation in value territory rather than full blown growth mode.

One-Year Investment Performance

For investors willing to look back instead of staring only at blinking tickers, the one year scorecard for General Motors Co stock is a reminder of how sentiment swings can reshape portfolios. Using verified historical close data, the stock price from exactly one year ago was materially lower than the latest last close. That translates into a solid double digit percentage gain over twelve months, even after factoring in the recent consolidation. A hypothetical investor who had put 10,000 US dollars into GM at that earlier close would be sitting on a sizable profit today, plus dividends, rather than licking wounds.

Emotionally, this one year journey has not felt like a straight climb. There were moments when headlines about slowing EV demand or software delays made it look as if the market had given up on the Detroit icon’s transformation. Yet those who held their nerve and treated GM as a multi year capital return and restructuring story, rather than a quarterly EV scoreboard, have been rewarded. The percentage gain over the period underscores that sometimes the best opportunities emerge when the narrative is dominated by doubt rather than consensus optimism.

Of course, the one year gain also raises a harder question for new money: is the easy part already done? Valuation metrics now embed at least some recognition that GM can balance legacy profitability with future technologies. Anyone deploying capital at current levels needs to decide whether the next twelve months will add another leg of upside or flatten into a grinding range where dividends and buybacks do most of the heavy lifting.

Recent Catalysts and News

Earlier this week, news flow around General Motors Co stock centered on operational fine tuning rather than blockbuster announcements. Coverage from outlets such as Reuters and Bloomberg highlighted how GM is recalibrating its electric vehicle rollout, prioritizing models and geographies where demand visibility is highest and infrastructure is more supportive. That message resonated with investors tired of loss making EV headlines and signaled a pragmatic shift toward profitability and capital discipline in the transition phase.

A few days prior, additional reports focused on GM’s software and services ambitions, including its evolving approach to in vehicle digital platforms and monetization of connected car features. Commentators noted that, while Cruise continues to face regulatory and public perception hurdles after its autonomous operations reset, GM is not backing away from the broader thesis that software based revenue can supplement traditional hardware margins. The nuance in recent commentary suggested that the market is starting to distinguish between short term turbulence at Cruise and the longer term opportunity to embed recurring revenue streams in GM’s massive installed base.

Over the last week, there has also been attention on GM’s ongoing cost initiatives and capacity adjustments in response to a more normalized post pandemic demand environment. Analysts pointed to GM’s cautious stance on incentives and production schedules as evidence that management is prioritizing pricing and margin stability over sheer market share. While such moves can cap unit growth, they also protect earnings quality, which matters when investors are increasingly selective in cyclical sectors.

Notably, there have been no seismic shifts in top leadership or emergency guidance cuts in the very recent news cycle. Instead, the tone is one of incremental adjustment, with GM fine tuning its mix between combustion, hybrid and electric products and managing inventory flows in North America and key international markets. For traders hunting for big headlines, this may feel underwhelming, but for long term holders, steadier news can signal a consolidation phase in which the company executes rather than constantly redefines its story.

Wall Street Verdict & Price Targets

Sell side sentiment on General Motors Co stock, based on recent research notes from major investment banks, has tilted moderately positive while stopping short of unanimous conviction. Over the past several weeks, houses such as Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan and Morgan Stanley have reiterated or updated their views, with a cluster of ratings in the Buy and Overweight camp and a meaningful minority sticking with Neutral or Hold stances. The common thread is that GM screens as undervalued on traditional metrics like price to earnings and free cash flow yield, but the market is skeptical about how smooth the EV and autonomous transition will be.

Goldman Sachs, for example, has maintained a constructive view on GM, emphasizing the strength of the North American truck and SUV franchise and the potential for shareholder returns through buybacks and dividends. Its price target, sitting noticeably above the current trading level, implies double digit percentage upside if execution unfolds as planned. J.P. Morgan’s analysts have also leaned positive, highlighting GM’s cost discipline and the optionality embedded in its software and EV operations, though they flag cyclical risk if macro conditions deteriorate.

Morgan Stanley’s approach has been somewhat more cautious, acknowledging GM’s progress on capital allocation but warning that the pace of EV adoption and regulatory uncertainties keep the risk profile elevated. Bank of America and Deutsche Bank, in recent notes, have pointed to GM as a value play within the global auto sector, with price objectives that cluster in a range comfortably above the latest last close. When aggregated, these views translate into a consensus that could be summarized as a soft Buy or positive Hold: attractive upside on paper, tempered by execution and cycle risk that investors cannot ignore.

For market participants, the key takeaway from this chorus is that Wall Street is no longer treating GM purely as an old economy automaker. Price targets increasingly bake in a multi pillar story that spans legacy combustion profits, emerging EV and software revenues and a still uncertain but potentially powerful contribution from autonomous technologies. The verdict is not a euphoric stamp of approval, yet it is clearly more generous than the deeply discounted valuations seen at previous points of pessimism.

Future Prospects and Strategy

At its core, General Motors Co still earns the bulk of its money by designing, manufacturing and selling cars, trucks and SUVs, with North America as its profit engine. That traditional business funds the company’s ambitious strategy to reinvent itself as a mobility and technology platform. GM is investing heavily in Ultium based electric vehicles, battery plants and an ecosystem of charging and software services, while also nurturing Cruise and other advanced technology bets. The challenge is to manage this portfolio so that legacy operations stay profitable long enough to finance the new world without exhausting investor patience.

Over the coming months, several factors will shape the performance of General Motors Co stock. First, macro conditions and consumer credit trends will influence demand for big ticket vehicles, especially in the lucrative pickup and SUV segments. Second, the trajectory of EV adoption, particularly in North America and China, will determine whether GM’s capacity investments translate into growth or margin pressure. Third, regulatory decisions and public acceptance around autonomous driving will influence how quickly Cruise can move from experimental to commercial scale.

On the positive side, GM’s balance sheet is stronger than in past cycles, and management has signaled a firm commitment to returning capital when cash flows allow. Continued share repurchases and a growing dividend could provide a floor for the stock, even if topline growth is choppy. On the risk side, any missteps in product launches, software reliability or safety incidents in autonomous trials could quickly erode the fragile confidence built over the last year. In this sense, GM’s future is a test case for whether a legacy industrial champion can pivot fast enough to compete with both traditional rivals and nimble tech oriented entrants.

For investors, the current setup around General Motors Co stock is less about chasing a momentum story and more about judging execution over a medium term horizon. The recent consolidation in the share price, coupled with supportive though not euphoric analyst coverage, hints at a market in wait and see mode. If GM can string together several quarters of steady margins, disciplined EV rollouts and clearer milestones for software and autonomous revenues, the path toward the upper half of its 52 week range and beyond remains open. If not, the stock risks slipping back toward its value trap reputation, with the last year’s gains looking like a temporary reprieve instead of the start of a durable rerating.",https://mdb.ad-hoc-news.de/bilder/bild-2405001_600_800.jpg,N,,2026-01-01 07:57:54.130846

FORT COLLINS, Colo. (AP) — The Trump administration has told another coal-fired power facility to remain open, this time ordering the owners of a Colorado electricity generating unit to keep it running beyond its Wednesday retirement date.

Compliance will cost Tri-State Generation and Transmission Association and the other owners of the Craig Station power plant in northwestern Colorado. The plant owners will need to fix a broken valve that put the power plant's 446-megawatt Unit 1 out of operation on Dec. 19, Tri-State said in a statement.

The order from Energy Secretary Chris Wright follows recent Department of Energy moves to keep coal-fired power stations open in Indiana, Washington state and Michigan despite efforts by their owners to close them.

It’s part of President Donald Trump’s push to revive the U.S. coal industry at a time when many utilities are shifting to cheaper, less-polluting energy sources such as natural gas and renewables. The administration, meanwhile, has blocked renewable energy, including wind power.

The 45-year-old generator in Colorado, one of three at Craig Station, had been scheduled to close at the end of 2025.

“As a not-for-profit cooperative, our membership will bear the costs of compliance with this order unless we can identify a method to share costs with those in the region,” Tri-State CEO Duane Highley said in the statement.

The power plant's owners had been planning since 2016 to shut down Unit 1 for economic reasons and to comply with “numerous state and federal requirements.”

Asked how much returning the unit to operation would cost and how long that would take, Tri-State spokesperson Amy Robertson said by email that the utility had no further information to share.

The generator must remain operational to address a shortage of electricity and electrical generation in the northwestern U.S., Wright wrote in Tuesday's emergency order keeping the unit operational.

“The Trump Administration is committed to lowering energy costs and keeping American families safe,” Wright said in a release.

Wade Gerber, who works at the power plant, said the announcement changes little for Colorado’s coal country, which is undergoing a long-term shift away from the fossil fuel as a pillar of the local economy.

He sees Craig — a city of about 9,000 people — as caught in the middle of a dizzying political battle.

“What does this administration get to do? What does the next administration get to do? Is it going to make (coal) any long-term thing? No, probably not,” Gerber said.

Gerber recently opened a distillery that caters to the cocktail lounge his wife owns next door, with plans to begin distributing more widely in 2026.

“I already told both my bosses, if that blows up even a little bit, I can tell you: ‘Here’s my two-week notice,’” Gerber said.

Colorado officials criticized the Trump administration order as a disservice to electricity users.

“It is unacceptable to burden ratepayers with these unnecessary costs,” Democratic U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet said in a statement.

The power plant was completed in 1980. Its No. 2 and No. 3 units have been scheduled to be retired in 2028. The plant’s fuel is mined at the nearby Trapper Mine, which is also scheduled to close.

“This data is necessary for EPA to evaluate and manage the risks associated with PFAS exposure and to prevent harm to human health and the environment,” the attorneys general representing 15 states wrote in a Dec. 22 comment letter. “EPA fails to provide a reasoned explanation for its sudden reversal and ignores the substantial body of reliable scientific research showing the importance of collecting this data.”

PFAS have been used in consumer products since the 1940s — including clothing, non-stick cookware, food packaging, car seats, and strollers.

The chemicals have been known to cause harms such as the increased risk of kidney, breast, pancreas, prostate, and testicular cancers as well as liver damage, high cholesterol and infertility.

“North Carolinians should be able to get straightforward information about how much and what kinds of PFAS are in the products we buy,” Jackson said in a Tuesday statement. “The EPA shouldn’t be helping companies hide what kinds of toxic chemicals they’re using. We know what PFAS damage looks like in North Carolina, and we need these companies to be more responsible.”

Jackson’s office has filed lawsuits against DuPont and Chemours, two chemical companies, for their role in PFAS contamination to natural resources and drinking water in the Cape Fear River Basin and its communities.

MADISON — Gov. Tony Evers today, in celebration of 2025 coming to an end, reflected on his administration’s efforts over the past year to serve Wisconsinites in every corner of the state and highlighted several administration-wide accomplishments for the year, including efforts to support Wisconsin’s kids and families during the Year of the Kid, as declared by the governor in January this year.

“2025 the Year of the Kid was one to remember, and I couldn’t be prouder of our work to do the right thing and do what’s best for our kids and the families and communities who raise them,” said Gov. Evers. “We delivered a bipartisan, pro-kid budget that invested in our kids at every age and every stage. We cut out-of-pocket costs for Wisconsin families by eliminating the sales tax on utility bills and investing in child care for kids and families, and we continued our work to fix the darn roads, build affordable, workforce housing, ensure folks have clean, safe drinking water straight from the tap, and so much more.

“I want to extend my gratitude to all the hardworking folks at our state agencies, my staff, and folks across the state who work tirelessly each and every day to make sure state government works—and works better—for the people of Wisconsin,” continued Gov. Evers. “We accomplished so much together this past year, and I’m excited to continue our work in 2026. Forward and for Wisconsin, always.”

Among Gov. Evers’ and the Evers Administration’s 2025 accomplishments include: signing 82 bills into law, including the bipartisan, pro-kid 2025-27 Biennial Budget; creating a statewide Wisconsin Office of Violence Prevention; approving a new emergency rule to combat lead poisoning statewide; ending fiscal year (FY) 2025 with a positive ending balance of $4.6 billion in the General Fund—the state’s main checking account—exceeding previous estimates by over $265 million; celebrating Wisconsin’s third consecutive record-breaking year of tourism economic impact; granting over 1,800 pardons since 2019; securing the largest investment for the University of Wisconsin (UW) System in nearly two decades; increasing the Wisconsin Shares Child Care Subsidy Program and saving approximately 15,000 Wisconsin families around $174 per month on average on child care costs; moving forward with his comprehensive correctional facilities plan announced earlier this year to close Green Bay Correctional Institution and Lincoln Hills and Copper Lake Schools as a youth facility; celebrating his 49th back-to-school season with kids, educators, school-staff, and families across the state; completing his annual 72-county statewide tour for the sixth time as governor; improving more than 9,600 miles of road and 2,400 bridges since 2019; continuing efforts to build more than 30,000 units of housing since 2019, and much more.

In addition to Gov. Evers many accomplishments during 2025 the Year of the Kid, the governor fought to ensure the over 700,000 Wisconsinites, and 270,000 kids who rely on Wisconsin FoodShare, also known as SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program), received their critical benefits for the month of November after Republican’s federal government shutdown—the longest federal government shutdown in the nation’s history—delayed these funds for folks and families across the nation.

A comprehensive but not exhaustive list of Gov. Evers and the Evers Administration’s 2025 accomplishments is available below.

Doing What’s Best for Kids During 2025 the Year of the Kid and Investing in Public Education at Every Level

Gov. Evers released a statement celebrating the enactment of the bipartisan Supporting America’s Children and Families Act (H.R.9076), which was signed by President Joe Biden. Gov. Evers had previously led a coalition of 26 bipartisan governors from across the nation in 2024 in sending a letter to congressional leaders urging them to pass a bill to improve the ability of state, Tribal, and local child support agencies to serve families and their kids and prevent the suspension of child support payments to thousands of Wisconsin families.

Gov. Evers, during his 2025 State of the State address, declared 2025 the Year of the Kid in Wisconsin, urging the Wisconsin State Legislature to do what is best for kids in the 2025-27 Biennial Budget by joining him in supporting historic increases for K-12 schools and the UW System, reducing crime and violence to keep kids safe, ensuring kids have clean, safe water to drink and healthy nutritious food to eat at school, among several other important priorities..

Gov. Evers kicked off 2025 the Year of the Kid by approving a new emergency rule to combat lead poisoning statewide and directed another $5 million in federal funds to support the expanded Well Compensation and Well Abandonment Grant Program. Gov. Evers recognizes that in order for kids to bring their best and full selves to the classroom and prepare for their futures, kids and families must have access to clean, safe drinking water that is free of harmful contaminants like PFAS and lead. By lowering the lead poisoning threshold to 3.5 µg/dL, more kids and families will be eligible for lead poisoning and intervention resources.

In May, Gov. Evers announced the Wisconsin Department of Health Services (DHS) made this emergency rule permanent.

Gov. Evers released two independent audits of Milwaukee Public Schools (MPS). The first audit report released in February relates to MPS’s operations, processes, and procedures. The second report, released in June, relates to the instructional policies and methodologies at MPS.

In March, Gov. Evers wrapped up a statewide tour of nine UW campuses. Gov. Evers’ statewide tour of UW campuses came as he released his 2025-27 Capital Budget proposal, which included significant investments to help build, improve, and modernize state infrastructure, including at UW System campuses.

Gov. Evers released a statement celebrating the Wisconsin Supreme Court’s decision in LeMieux v. Evers, upholding the governor’s partial line-item veto in the 2023-25 budget that provided Wisconsin school districts with continued, additive per pupil revenue adjustments of $325 every year through 2425.

Gov. Evers, together with the Wisconsin Department of Financial Institutions (DFI), highlighted a new promotion from Edvest 529, Wisconsin’s direct-sold college savings plan, to help families save for their kids’ future education. In celebration of the 2025 NFL Draft being held in Wisconsin from April 21-27, 2025, accounts opened with an initial deposit of at least $25 received a $25 bonus deposit from Edvest 529.

Gov. Evers, together with the Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development (DWD), celebrated “National Apprenticeship Day” and 2025 the Year of the Kid by announcing that for the fourth year in a row, Wisconsin’s Youth Apprenticeship program set a new record high of 11,344 youth apprentices enrolled during the 2024-25 school year, a 14 percent increase from the prior year.

Gov. Evers celebrated the grand opening of the new Flambeau River YMCA in Park Falls, which was funded in part by a $5.6 million grant through investments the governor directed to support the Neighborhood Investment Fund grant program. A branch of the YMCA of the Northwoods, the Flambeau YMCA will provide area residents access to a 40-capacity child care center, senior center, youth sports programming, and a 24/7 fitness center. The primary need for the facility came about after local residents struggled to access quality, affordable child care in the community after facilities closed their doors during the pandemic, creating a significant workforce barrier for area families.

Gov. Evers delivered on his promise to pass a pro-kid budget that makes meaningful investments in Wisconsin’s kids at every stage and every age, from early childhood to K-12 to higher education institutions, by reaching a bipartisan agreement after months of negotiations with Republican leaders and signed the 2025-27 Biennial Budget into law.

Gov. Evers secured a more than $360 million investment in child care in the 2025-27 Biennial Budget, including delivering on the governor’s promise to secure direct payments for child care providers—a bright line the governor previously signaled would force him to veto the budget if Republicans failed to pass a budget without it. This $360 million investment includes:

$110 million in direct payments to child care providers to help providers keep their doors open and lights on, cut child care wait lists, and lower out-of-pocket child care costs for working families;

$66 million to fund a new “Get Kids Ready” initiative, the first-ever child care program funded solely by general purpose revenue, or GPR, in Wisconsin state history, which will support child care providers serving four-year-olds to help prepare Wisconsin’s kids for the classroom and get an earlier jump start on learning at a critical time in development;

$2 million designed to help child care providers across the state build capacity to be able to cut child care wait lists and ensure more kids and families have access to affordable child care; and

Over $123 million to increase rates under the Wisconsin Shares Child Care Subsidy Program to help lower out-of-pocket child care costs for working families across the state.

Gov. Evers fought hard to make sure the 2025-27 Biennial Budget provided increased investments for Wisconsin’s kids and public K-12 schools. After Republican lawmakers threatened to provide no new increases for schools, through negotiations, Gov. Evers secured:

A nearly $1.4 billion increase in spendable revenue for K-12 schools across the state in the 2025-27 Biennial Budget, an over $200 million increase from the historic 2023-25 K-12 budget;

The largest percent increase in the special education reimbursement rate in state history, which will increase to 42 percent in the first year of the biennium and 45 percent in the second year of the biennium;

This is the highest reimbursement rate in 30 years and a larger increase for special education than the last three state budgets combined.

$30 million to continue providing comprehensive school-based mental health services statewide, modeled on the governor’s successful “Get Kids Ahead” initiative.

Gov. Evers negotiated to secure the largest increase for the UW System in nearly 20 years with an over $250 million investment in the 2025-27 Biennial Budget, as well as another nearly $1.2 billion investment to support capital building projects on campuses across the state.

Gov. Evers wrapped up a statewide tour visiting child care providers across the state, and along with the Wisconsin Department of Children and Families (DCF), celebrated the launch of the $110 million Child Care Bridge Payment program, created in the 2025-27 Biennial Budget signed by Gov. Evers to avoid a gap in critical assistance to child care providers as the governor’s successful Child Care Counts Payment Program came to an end. In 2025, Child Care Bridge Payment ensured employment of more than 32,000 child care professionals and allowed providers to continue care for more than 169,000 kids through over $35 million in direct payments to providers.

Gov. Evers, together with DFI, celebrated College Savings Month by encouraging Wisconsinites to start or boost their college savings through the Wisconsin 529 College Savings Program. Gov. Evers proclaimed September as “College Savings Month” in Wisconsin.

Gov. Evers wrapped up his annual statewide back-to-school tour, during which he visited K-12 schools in communities across the state to welcome students, families, educators, and staff back to school for the 2025-26 school year. As a former teacher, principal, superintendent, and state superintendent, this year marked Gov. Evers’ 49th back-to-school season.

Gov. Evers visited six UW System campuses across the state to celebrate and welcome educators, students, staff, and administrators back to school for the 2025-26 school year. During the visits, the governor highlighted his work to secure over $250 million for the UW System over the next two years, the largest increase for the UW System in nearly 20 years, as well as the over$1.2 billion in the 2025-27 Capital Budget for critical infrastructure projects on UW campuses statewide, including projects at UW-Madison, La Crosse, Oshkosh, Stout, Milwaukee, Platteville, and Stevens Point.

Gov. Evers, together with DCF, announced in October that Wisconsin Shares families would see an increase in their subsidy amount, thanks to the governor’s investment of over $123 million in the Wisconsin Shares Child Care Subsidy Program in the bipartisan, pro-kid 2025-27 Biennial Budget. The increase impacted roughly 15,000 Wisconsin Shares families, with the average savings per family being around $174 per month.

Gov. Evers signed a bipartisan bill aimed at creating a statewide ban on cellphone use in the classroom, as growing evidence shows that schools with phone bans foster stronger social connections, improved classroom focus, and better health and safety of students.

Gov. Evers announced “The Learning Tree” as the theme for the 2025 State Capitol Holiday Tree and invited students to contribute handmade ornaments celebrating and thanking Wisconsin’s educators, child care providers, administrators, custodians, school bus drivers, counselors, librarians, school staff, tutors, mentors, after-school program teachers, and all the heroes in their lives who help them learn and support, educate, empower, and inspire them. The Wisconsin Capitol Holiday Tree was nationally ranked No. 7 by USA Today as part of the 10 BEST Readers’ Choice Awards for the “Best Public Holiday Lights Display.”

Gov. Evers announced he approved a new administrative rule designed to help improve the state’s foster care system by ensuring kids can more easily be placed with family relatives or like-kin caregivers when they are unable to safely remain in their home. The move takes an evidence-driven approach to help improve stability and permanent placement, which are critical for kids’ success, by increasing the number of kids and youth who are placed with people who know and love them.

DCF, along with the Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction and DHS, launched a collaborative process between agencies to revise the decades-old Wisconsin’s Early Learning Development Guidelines. This collaborative effort works to strengthen Wisconsin’s early childhood state system and provide crucial resources on early childhood development to professionals.

DCF launched the Roadmap to Child Care Regulation, an interactive webpage designed to help prospective providers determine the best program option for their situation, navigate the regulation process with step-by-step guidance, understand necessary documents and verifications, and learn how to provide a healthy, nurturing, and safe environment for kids.

YoungStar, Wisconsin’s child care quality rating and improvement system, reached 3,953 participating providers—its highest since 2016.

Edvest 529 and Tomorrow’s Scholar both received a rating of “High Honors” from Saving For College, a leading source for unbiased information on 529 college savings plans. Plans with this recognition have outperformed their category average compared to peers in performance, ease of use, savings success, and program delivery. Additionally, Edvest 529 was named as a Best 529 Plan of 2025 by Morningstar analysts, retaining its standing as a bronze-rated plan.

Building Strong and Safe Communities for All

In January, Gov. Evers, joined by violence prevention advocates, local law enforcement, elected officials, students, and community members, signed Executive Order #245 to create a statewide Wisconsin Office of Violence Prevention and directed $10 million for the office to begin its work and administer grants supporting violence and gun violence prevention efforts statewide. After months of work to stand up the office, in December, Gov. Evers announced the opening of grant applications to support initiatives and programs at school districts, law enforcement agencies, domestic violence organizations, firearm retailers, and local governments, among others, to help prevent violence across Wisconsin. More information on the efforts of the office, as well as how to apply for the first round of grant awards, is available here.

Gov. Evers, during his 2025 State of the State address, announced his 2025-27 Executive Budget would include his most robust and comprehensive gun safety reform efforts to date to address crime, prevent gun violence, and keep kids, families, and communities safe. Unfortunately, Republicans in the Wisconsin State Legislature gutted the governor’s proposals to keep Wisconsinites safe from the final budget.

Gov. Evers, together with the Wisconsin Department of Military Affairs (DMA), announced $2 million in grants to local communities and organizations through the Pre-Disaster Flood Resilience Grant Program.

The Wisconsin Office of the Commissioner of Insurance (OCI) announced the issuance of the agency’s first forfeiture related to insurance fraud under Wis. Stat. § 601.41 (12), resulting in a total of $33,000 in forfeitures. Forfeitures like these go to the state’s Common School Fund, which provides books, computers, and other library materials to schools across Wisconsin.

The Wisconsin Department of Corrections (DOC) held its first-ever Friends and Family Forum, meeting with more than 40 friends and family members of persons in DOC facilities, at the Kolb Center on the Fox Lake Correctional Institution campus. The forums, which are designed to engage the community in rehabilitation and to improve communication, are now held quarterly.

This year, the Wisconsin Department of Safety and Protective Services (DSPS) sent payments totaling over $36 million to fire departments across the state as part of the Wisconsin 2% Fire Dues Program. The 2025 total represents a nearly 12 percent increase over the total distribution in 2024.

In efforts to continue to make Wisconsin roads safer, Wisconsin DMV’s Driver Education Grant program received continued funding through Gov. Evers’ 2025-27 Biennial Budget to continue to provide driver training for eligible students and teens.

As a significant influx of digital phishing scams hit the nation and state of Wisconsin, the Wisconsin DMV worked to educate consumers on how to avoid the scams, provide resources on how to protect themselves, and coordinated with partner states to ensure the region stayed aware of emerging scams.

The Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade, and Consumer Protection (DATCP) launched new consumer protection outreach toolkits in partnership with DFI and the Governor’s Council on Financial Literacy and Capability. These toolkits contain downloadable materials that can be used by educators, businesses, community organizations, and other groups to teach students, staff, group members, and other audiences about common consumer protection issues and how to prevent and protect against scams and frauds.

Gov. Evers, together with DOC Secretary Jared Hoy, celebrated successful reforms at Lincoln Hills and Copper Lake Schools, which have reached a significant milestone and a crucial step toward closing the two juvenile corrections facilities and moving youth to new facilities to receive treatment closer to their home communities. After child abuse scandals at the schools under former Gov.

Gov.

To date, this funding has supported the development of over 1,600 workforce housing units statewide.

Gov. Evers celebrated the one-year anniversary of the launch of the Home Energy Rebate Programs in Wisconsin, which have helped residents statewide reduce energy use and lower utility bills.

Gov. Evers celebrated his plan to lower energy bill costs for Wisconsin’s working families, a crucial piece of which went into effect on Oct. 1. Thanks to the bipartisan, pro-kid budget Gov. Evers enacted this summer, Wisconsin residents will no longer pay sales and use tax on electricity and natural gas consumed in their homes, helping to lower out-of-pocket costs on energy and utility bills across the state. The proposal, which Gov. Evers originally proposed in the executive budget he introduced in February, is projected to save Wisconsin households more than $178 million over the next two years.

Gov. Evers, together with the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin (PSC), announced in October that Wisconsin residents can access Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) Home Energy Rebates directly at retail locations, with instant discounts and post-purchase rebates. Through the Home Electrification and Appliance Rebates (HEAR) Program, customers can purchase qualifying electric appliances bought in-store or online, building upon the contractor-based rebates available since late 2024. This program helps reduce the purchase price to low- and moderate-income households for installing energy-efficient appliances, which lower costs for working families by helping households save on energy bills.

Gov. Evers and WHEDA also announced that 59 organizations will receive $2 million in grants from the WHEDA Foundation to improve emergency shelters, transitional residences, and extremely low-income housing.

Over the course of the year, more than 500 homes were repaired with $20 million allocated through WHEDA’s More Like Home™ Repair and Renew Loan program to help owners of older homes make critical repairs and improvements that increase energy efficiency, safety, and security. This program reinvests in our older housing stock to stabilize property values and make housing safer, more stable, and more secure for Wisconsinites in every corner of the state.

According to WHEDA, $36 million in state and federal housing tax credits was distributed to developers this year. In total, 27 developments will provide 1,731 new affordable housing units in 23 rural, small urban, and urban communities struggling to provide housing for working families.

In the 2025 fiscal year, the WHEDA single-family team closed 2,323 first mortgage loans totaling more than $481 million.

To date, the state of Wisconsin assisted thousands of Wisconsinites with housing, including providing tenant-based rental assistance and/or rapid re-house for over 2,000 households, overnight shelter for nearly 16,500 individuals, homelessness prevention and assistance services to nearly 4,000, and community development services and public facility benefits to over 57,860.

DHS launched a housing support service to Wisconsin Medicaid members experiencing housing insecurity who are also affected by substance use or mental health conditions. People who are struggling with substance use or mental health challenges who have a place to call home can significantly improve their overall health and quality of life. DHS created this benefit as directed under 2019 Wisconsin Act 76 and with Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services approval.

DOA Assisted over 186,300 households with their energy bills through the Wisconsin Home Energy Assistance Program, as well as helped more than 4,360 households save on average $325/yr on energy costs after weatherization improvements.

The governor’s proposal, which was included in his 2025-27 Executive Budget, came as Wisconsinites saw five statewide referenda questions in 2024—the most in a single year in over four decades, according to a report from the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel—all of which were drafted, legislatively passed, and placed on the ballot by Republican lawmakers, largely without direct input from the people of Wisconsin. Unfortunately, the Republican-controlled state budget committee stripped this proposal from the final 2025-27 Biennial Budget.

Gov. Evers delivered his 2025 State of the State address. The governor’s address is available to watch here.

$22.1 billion in tax revenue;

$362.8 million in delinquent taxes; and

$77.5 million in statewide debt for more than 600 state agencies and local governments.

This summer, DSPS celebrated a near-record month for new licenses issued, having issued 6,800 new license applications in June—making it one of the top three most productive months in the history of the agency. In his budget request this year, Gov. Evers asked for nine full-time licensing positions at DSPS and 14 full-time positions in the agency’s call center to continue efficient and successful customer service operations to address the high demand for licensed occupations. Republicans in the Legislature ultimately declined to approve necessary resources in the state budget that would enable the department to continue processing license applications at the fastest rate in state history. The cuts will dramatically slow the agency’s current licensing pace, reversing historic progress at the agency.

In the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision overturning Roe v. Wade three years ago—a decision that effectively forced Wisconsin to operate under a near-complete abortion ban, even in the cases of rape and incest, for over a year—the Wisconsin Supreme Court released a decision protecting reproductive freedom and affirming Wisconsinites continue to have access to abortion care in a challenge brought by Gov. Evers and Attorney General Josh Kaul.

The DNR’s watershed grants programs awarded $7.15 million in 2025 to counties and communities for projects to reduce nutrient runoff from urban and agricultural areas into the state’s waters. This money was made available through DNR’s Targeted Runoff Management, Urban Nonpoint Source and Notice of Discharge grants.

Protecting Wisconsinites from Reckless Federal Actions

Gov. Evers and Attorney General Kaul announced Wisconsin joined a coalition of states challenging an unconstitutional executive order issued by the Trump Administration that attempted to end citizenship for certain kids born in America, violating Americans’ constitutional rights to which all kids born in the United States have long been entitled.

Gov. Evers and Attorney General Kaul announced Wisconsin would be joining a coalition of states in a lawsuit to immediately stop a Trump Administration policy aimed at unilaterally forcing all federal agencies to stop nearly all federal assistance and grant and loan funding that support kids, families, and communities in Wisconsin and across our country. The Trump Administration’s policy would have immediately jeopardized critical federal benefits and investments that provide crucial health and childcare services, support public schools, combat hate crimes and violence against women, and provide life-saving disaster relief to states, among other critical programs.

Gov. Evers released a statement regarding a new lawsuit brought by a multi-state coalition, including Wisconsin, against the Trump Administration and aimed at protecting Wisconsinites’ Social Security numbers, bank account information, and other sensitive personal details from unauthorized access.

Gov. Evers released a statement regarding Wisconsin joining a new multi-state lawsuit to stop the Trump Administration from gutting funding for life-saving medical research, which would have a devastating impact on Wisconsin, the state’s flagship campus, and renowned research institutions in the UW System and across the country.

Gov. Evers released an open letter to Congressional Republicans, including Republican members of Wisconsin’s congressional delegation, urging them to take swift and urgent action to stand up for Wisconsin and fight against President Trump and the Trump Administration’s reckless, chaotic decisions and efforts to erode constitutional checks and balances and end attacks on federal programs and the federal workforce that are already hurting Wisconsinites and Americans across the country.

Recently, although the stock price of Rivian Automotive (RIVN) remains significantly below its peak at the time of its 2021 IPO, it has rebounded from recent lows, partially reviving market optimism. The company’s third-quarter 2025 financial report showed a notable year-over-year increase in revenue, with deliveries exceeding production and a small positive gross profit achieved. Management highlighted operational progress, including advancing plans for the R2 model with a starting price of $45,000 and constructing large-scale new facilities and the Georgia plant to support production. However, its quarterly deliveries still fall far short of both existing and planned production capacity. With the expiration of federal electric vehicle tax credits, market demand faces a test. Meanwhile, the company’s net cash on the balance sheet is limited, while future capital expenditure needs are substantial. Unless the R2 model achieves significant success, the company could face severe challenges.

The More Severe Dilemma of Lucid Group

The situation of Lucid Group (LCID) is considered even more difficult. Despite its models receiving favorable reviews from the media, its products are priced at a premium. Although sales have grown, gross losses and operating losses continue to widen, presenting a scenario of “selling more, losing more.” The company’s free cash flow is deeply negative, and its cash reserves are lower than its total debt. To sustain operations, Lucid has engaged in financing that may lead to equity dilution. Its overall financial condition indicates that the company is under significant pressure, and survival risks cannot be ignored.

Tesla’s Contrast and Resilience

While Rivian and Lucid face significant difficulties, Tesla (TSLA), as a pioneer in the electric vehicle field, presents a different picture in terms of its fundamentals. Although the company also faces certain public relations challenges brought about by its CEO, its financial performance remains relatively solid. Over the past 12 months, Tesla has achieved considerable profitability, with cash reserves significantly exceeding its debt and consistent positive free cash flow generation. Compared to many cash-burning competitors, Tesla demonstrates stronger financial resilience and self-sustaining capability. From a specific investment perspective, among current electric vehicle stocks, Tesla may still be viewed by some as a potentially more promising choice.

Conclusion

In summary, both Rivian Automotive and Lucid Group face severe challenges such as mismatches between sales and production capacity, continuous losses, and tight cash flow. Their survival and development depend on the success of future models and effective fundraising. In contrast, Tesla, with its achieved profitability, healthy cash flow, and solid balance sheet, demonstrates stronger operational resilience amid industry volatility.",https://nai500.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/From-Rivian-and-Lucid-to-Tesla-A-Game-of-Survival-and-Triumph.jpg,N,,2026-01-01 03:57:40.190179

The proposed 318,000-square-foot facility would require the filling of saturated areas on about 6 acres, according to the construction application. Members of the public may comment online by Friday.

Public comment closes Friday, Jan. 2, on a construction application for a warehouse in the wetlands near the Eugene Airport. The application has been filed by a developer with ties to Amazon.

Both state and federal regulators require such applications for projects that disturb wetlands to monitor compliance with the Clean Water Act.

TC Pursuit Services Inc. filed the application Nov. 3 with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the Oregon Department of State Lands. But the public comment period seemingly opened weeks later, just before the Christmas holiday.

Titled “Clear Lake E-Commerce,” the project includes a 318,000-square-foot building, semi-trailer parking and stormwater treatment infrastructure. The application does not name Amazon but describes the tenant as an “e-commerce company with economic interest in the area.”

TC Pursuit Services is a subsidiary of Trammell Crow Co., a Dallas-based commercial real estate developer that has built facilities for Amazon and other companies, according to reports from Texas, Washington and Wisconsin on similar fulfillment center proposals.

The construction application documents environmental impacts, including the filling of about 6.5 acres of saturated soil with imported earth or engineered materials such as concrete. The application states that no species protected under the federal Endangered Species Act rely on the site’s habitat.

However, it acknowledges documented sightings of the Western pond turtle in the surrounding area. That species is classified as “sensitive-critical” on Oregon’s State Sensitive Species List.

The application did not elaborate on emissions tied to the 976 fleet vehicle parking spaces and the roughly 2,600 daily vehicle trips the project could generate. It remains unclear how many of those vehicles would be electric, diesel-powered or a combination.

The Environmental Protection Agency has long linked vehicle exhaust to asthma and other respiratory illnesses, with children particularly vulnerable because of their developing lungs.

To regulate emissions, the Lane Regional Air Protection Agency approved an air permit in September. That permitting process garnered its own round of public comments.

While the project is located in a zoned industrial development area that the city designated to concentrate heavy uses away from residential neighborhoods, public concerns remain about its broader impacts.

Specifically, commenters raised concerns about truck traffic that could still cut through nearby neighborhoods, including Trainsong and Bethel. Residents from those areas wrote that their communities have already “suffered too much” from industrial pollution.",https://i0.wp.com/lookouteugene-springfield.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-31-at-4.15.46-PM.png?fit=1018%2C678&ssl=1,N,,2026-01-01 04:58:09.702301

With 2026 midterms on the horizon, North Carolinians should welcome the season not with campaign slogans, but with a clear-eyed demand for good public policy.

As we head into the new year, the question voters should ask is simple: Are lawmakers or candidates truly heroes of liberty in the ways that matter, or just in stump speeches?

Over the past decade, North Carolina has offered a case study in what accountable, liberty-minded governance can look like. Lawmakers pursued tax reform, regulatory restraint, and policies that expanded opportunity rather than dependency. The result has been sustained economic growth, more families moving to the state, and an environment where individuals can define their own destinies.

Those outcomes didn’t happen because of clever messaging or polished speeches. They happened because policymakers made choices and voters were able to judge them by their effects. In 2026, the same principle applies: the measure of leadership is in real-world impact, not talking points.

Too often, election seasons devolve into clickbait headlines, abstract promises, dire warnings, and partisan labels. But North Carolina’s recent history shows that the most meaningful question for voters is practical:

Did this leader make it easier to work, start a business, or keep more of your paycheck?

Did they give parents real authority over their children’s education?

Did they protect individual liberty by limiting the reach of unelected bureaucracies?

These are the questions that matter when deciding who truly deserves to be called a champion of freedom.

Redistricting has already sharpened the focus on several congressional and legislative races. New maps mean new political dynamics, but they do not change the underlying responsibility of those seeking office. Representation is not about geography alone. It’s about performance in defending liberty and opportunity.

A new year is also an opportunity for citizens to learn more about what liberty-based policy looks like in practice. The Carolina Liberty Conference, held this year Feb. 27-28 in Raleigh by the John Locke Foundation, offers a chance to explore the principles that underpin North Carolina’s most successful policies and understand how informed, principled leadership can expand prosperity.

North Carolina voters have repeatedly shown they are pragmatic. The recent rise in voters registering as independent shows that they are open to new ideas, not necessarily partisan labels. The skepticism of political parties is healthy. A free society depends on citizens who evaluate outcomes, not intentions.

As the new year begins, candidates know they have precious few seconds to capture public attention and midterm turnout, especially in primaries, is notoriously low. This year, let’s look for those willing to talk policy on the campaign trail, not just politics.",https://www.carolinajournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/north-Carolina-flag-scaled-e1647285502935.jpg,N,,2026-01-01 05:57:13.597755

The order from Energy Secretary Chris Wright will keep the nearly 50-year-old Craig Generating Station Unit 1 in northwest Colorado operating until the end of March, with an option to extend it further.

It’s the Department of Energy’s sixth such move this year; Wright has also ordered two coal plants in Indiana, one in Michigan and one in Washington state to stay open past their retirement dates, as well as a Pennsylvania power plant that runs on oil.

“Keeping this coal plant online will ensure Americans maintain an affordable, reliable, and secure supply of electricity,” Wright said in a statement.

Colorado’s governor and its top energy official pushed back on Wright’s claim that keeping Craig open would boost affordability, saying it would only raise electricity prices.

In a statement, Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, a Democrat, said the order would pass “tens of millions in costs to Colorado ratepayers, in order to keep a coal plant open that is broken and not needed.”

According to Polis’ statement, Craig 1 “isn’t even operational right now” and would require repairs costing millions of dollars to get it up and running before it could even produce power. Tri-State Generation and Transmission Association, the power supply co-op that owns Craig 1, said the unit has been offline since a critical part broke on December 19.

“As a not-for-profit cooperative, our membership will bear the costs of compliance with this order unless we can identify a method to share costs with those in the region,” said Tri-State CEO Duane Highley.

It would cost at least $20 million to keep Craig 1 operational for 90 days and approximately $85 million to run the unit for a year, according to a report from power sector consulting firm Grid Strategies, prepared for the Sierra Club. Those costs are mostly from the purchase of coal. However, the price tag could balloon to $150 million per year, depending on how much the DOE requires the plant to run, the Grid Strategies report said.

Colorado Energy Office executive director Will Toor said Tri-State has already built gas and renewables projects to replace the power the unit produced. Toor said the North American Electric Reliability Corporation has not forecast any reliability risks in the region.

In other words, Toor said, Craig 1 is simply not needed to bolster the state’s grid.

“We think there would be a very significant cost to ratepayers for no benefit,” Toor told CNN.

In addition, Toor said, Craig 1 was built near a coal seam that has had all of its coal mined. Procuring more coal from elsewhere would incur additional costs.

Wright’s order “is purely for the purpose of trying to keep coal in the system for ideological reasons, while driving up cost to customers,” Toor said. “At the same time, they are actually taking steps to reduce the reliability of the grid by making it far harder to deploy the resources that you can quickly build, which are wind and solar.”

Keeping other coal plants open past their retirement dates has foisted tens of millions of additional costs on ratepayers.

Electric cars aren’t political, but they rely on political support Electric vehicles aren’t really a left-or-right issue.","Five years ago, spotting a hybrid or electric car was a rare treat. Tesla sold about half a million EVs globally in 2020, proving the technology worked, while the Toyota Prius led hybrids in the US with 43,500 sales.

By 2025, the landscape has shifted dramatically. EVs grabbed 10.5 percent of new-car sales by Q3, thanks in part to expiring tax incentives.

Hybrids are even hotter, making up roughly one in five new vehicles sold. The Camry going hybrid-only is a clear marker of just how far the segment has come.

The Toyota Camry ushers hybrids into a golden age

The Toyota Camry made waves last year when news broke that the new model would be hybrid-only. Some longtime buyers weren’t thrilled, ready to say goodbye to the familiar nameplate.

Still, with a 17-horsepower boost over the 2024 Camry Hybrid, the new model is capable enough to quiet a lot of the early criticism.

If we had a choice, we’d pick a real 8-speed automatic over a CVT any day. But judging by the latest sales numbers, most Americans don’t seem to mind.

Here’s a look at how Camry sales have shaped up over the past five years.

These numbers don’t include December 2025.

The Camry has been averaging 24,056 units sold per month, so even with an average final month, the hybrid-only model could hit around 312,929 sales.

That would mark its second-highest sales this decade—and that’s a conservative estimate.

The 2025 Camry marks a milestone for hybrids

The Toyota Camry has been America’s favorite car—counting only sedans and coupes—for decades. Its only slip came in 2001, when the Honda Accord edged it out by a slim margin.

You might think Honda would have a shot at reclaiming the crown, but the Camry going hybrid-only hasn’t dented its sales one bit.

Toyota likely expected some drop in sales when it ditched the ICE Camry, but that never materialized.

While EVs may have been overhyped, with many brands dialing back their all-electric promises, hybrids are quietly proving they’re the real future of the auto industry.

A strange year for electrified vehicles

We’re still waiting on the year-end numbers for EVs and hybrids, but so far, things are going “according to plan.”

The news that EV tax credits would expire at the end of September gave the entire electrified segment a nice boost.

The Tesla Model Y sold 25,800 units in August and then posted its best month of the year in September with 30,702 units.

Tesla’s Q4 results are still up in the air, as is the bigger question of EV sales in a post-credit world.

Industry experts predicted exactly what we saw: a sharp spike as buyers rushed to grab expiring EV incentives.

We probably won’t see a total crash, but the September surge looks more like a one-time boom than a lasting upward trend.

Tesla stays king of EVs through the highs and lows

A quick look at Tesla’s stock over the past year tells the story: dramatic swings, soaring highs, and gut-dropping lows. It’s been that kind of strange, roller-coaster year.

Early in the year, Tesla’s stock nosedive and the rise of competing EVs had some wondering if its reign as the EV leader was ending. That clearly hasn’t happened.

Even so, electric vehicles are still a niche compared with hybrids.

Are we truly ready for an all-electric future?

Fully electrified highways may be inevitable—gasoline won’t last forever, and a switch to diesel isn’t very likely. Early estimates suggest it won’t happen for at least 25 years.

The real question isn’t if we’ll get there, but whether it’ll happen in the next five to ten years.

Without getting political, the facts are clear: it’s not going to happen during this administration.

The bipartisan infrastructure bill under President Biden helped put more charging stations on the map and encouraged buyers to cash in on EV tax credits.

On the other hand, President Trump has shown little interest in supporting or nudging the EV market, slowing much of the momentum it had gained.

Electric cars aren’t political, but they rely on political support

Electric vehicles aren’t really a left-or-right issue. Driving a Tesla doesn’t reveal your politics, and the word “bipartisan” played a key role in Biden’s infrastructure bill.

Major changes in the American auto industry have always leaned on government support. Think Eisenhower’s 1956 Highway Act or Obama’s $7,500 EV rebate—big shifts rarely happen without it.

Cars are heavily regulated because the government runs the roads and aims to keep cities smog-free. Without ongoing support, major changes in the industry are nearly impossible.

For now, electric cars are more of a “definitely someday” deal. We could see another big push toward electrification by the end of the decade.

But don’t expect it in the next three years. Whether that’s good or bad is up to you, but in the meantime, hybrids are likely to keep selling like crazy.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/c3P7Vy5gYMiEtIyPYP0Sow--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/how_to_geek_999/835cd552f76c5a11485235b0a04c2ae2,N,,2026-01-01 02:57:19.177687

Statewide emissions of carbon monoxide and sulfur dioxide, in particular, reached all-time lows in 2022, the latest year for which data are available from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

According to the report, statewide emissions of the air pollutants regulated under the federal Clean Air Act have declined sharply from 1990 through 2022. Specifically, emissions fell:

• 95% for sulfur dioxide (SO2)

• 74% for carbon monoxide (CO)

• 71% for nitrogen oxides (NOx)

• 48% for fine particles (PM5)

• 67% for volatile organic compounds (VOCs)

Average concentrations of SO2, for example, are 95% below the federal standard; annual nitrogen dioxide concentrations are 89% below the standard.

North Carolina’s transition away from coal for power generation has been a major driver of these changes. More of the state’s power now comes from clean sources such as solar, wind and nuclear energy. Energy efficiency improvements in homes and buildings also reduce emissions from power plants.

Cars, trucks and other vehicles on North Carolina roads also emit far less pollution than older vehicles, thanks to improved engine and fuel standards and more advanced emissions controls.

This transition to low-carbon and resilient infrastructure creates unprecedented workforce demands and opportunities. Jobs in renewable energy recorded the highest annual growth rate in 2023, reaching 16.2 million globally, with projections suggesting this could need to double by 2030 tion. Yet communities often lack access to the training, resources, and employment opportunities needed to join this workforce or build local capacity for resilience. This gap is particularly acute in underserved communities across these regions, where climate impacts hit hardest but pathways for skilled employment remain limited.

Examples of the many areas for climate resilience technology and innovation include AI-powered early warning systems and climate risk assessment tools, infrastructure hardening, flexible microgrids to maintain essential services, and broader deployment of nature-based solutions rooted in Indigenous and ancestral knowledge. When combined with new workforce pathways, climate resilience becomes an economic opportunity that strengthens communities while protecting ecosystems.

The Macquarie Community Resilience Prize seeks scalable, technology-enabled solutions that address these interconnected challenges across Brazil, Australia, and Pacific Islands, simultaneously strengthening climate resilience and developing the skilled workforce for the transition to a green economy. Solutions that integrate ancestral and Indigenous knowledge are especially encouraged to apply. The prize seeks solutions that address both community resilience to climate change and workforce training, including solutions that:

Address the following community resilience dimensions: Enhance infrastructure resilience for electrical, water, and other technical systems; reduce community risks from hazards such as wildfires, flooding, drought, and extreme heat; and strengthen climate-adapted agriculture and food systems, particularly those that protect and restore natural ecosystems.

And the following workforce and skilling dimensions: Train and upskill workers in trades for enabling infrastructure resilience and adapting communities; provide tools and opportunities that allow current workers to adopt climate resilience work within their portfolios; and enable new funding and employment models to support long-term community resilience and transition work.

Prize benefits include access to a prize pool of up to $1 million, which will be awarded to up to 10 winning teams. Award amounts could range from $50,000 to $250,000. In addition, each winner will receive a dedicated support program including a tailored needs assessment call, workshops, executive coaching, access to additional resources, and mentorship matchmaking between the winners and Macquarie Group employees.

Rivian and Lucid also sell vehicles directly to consumers, and now, it looks like Scout Motors will be joining in their footsteps.

Colorado Approves Scout's Sales Model

According to Automotive News, Colorado’s Motor Vehicle Dealer Board recently granted a dealer license to Scout Motors in the state of Colorado. The board voted six to two to approve Scout’s application to become a dealer in the state. With the dealer license, Scout Motors will be able to sell vehicles directly to consumers in Colorado. Scout’s license in Colorado is valid from December 16, 2025, to October 31, 2026.

The board’s decision comes at a tense time in the automotive industry, as more automakers look to adopt direct-to-consumer sales methods and face strong opposition from dealers. While it’s an early win for Scout, it’s a win nonetheless. And the win comes in a state that’s shaping up to be a key one for the automaker. Colorado is one of the larger electric vehicle markets in the U.S., and the state was identified as a prime location for Scout’s planned stores and experience centers.

Dealers Push Back on the Decision

While Scout is happy with the board’s decision, Colorado dealers aren’t as thrilled about the decision. “We’re disappointed,” Colorado Auto Dealers Association CEO Matthew Groves told Automotive News. “We have a law that specifically prohibits manufacturers from having control of the dealership, and now the state’s just granted a manufacturer control of the dealership.”

From Groves' perspective, he believes that Scout is inherently different from Tesla, Rivian, and Lucid, which have been able to sell vehicles directly to consumers for some time now. Groves believes that these automakers are different and should be allowed to have a direct-to-consumer sales model because they do not have franchise agreements in place with legacy automakers, reports Automotive News.

Scout Faces Challenges Outside Colorado

While Volkswagen owns the Scout brand, the German automaker claims that Scout Motors is an independent startup. Additionally, the Colorado Motor Vehicle Dealer Board ruled that Scout is not a same-line manufacturer as VW, Audi, or Porsche, according to Automotive News. That ruling may have played a large role in Scout receiving a dealer license, as it means that Scout doesn't have any existing franchise agreements in the state.

In a statement to Automotive News, Cody Thacker, Scout’s vice president of commercial operations, thanked Colorado’s Motor Vehicle Dealer Board for their decision to grant the automaker a dealer license. “Despite repeated attempts by dealer lobbyists to unfairly prevent Colorado consumers from choosing how they want to buy cars, today’s decisive approval by the Dealer Board ensures that we can continue moving forward with our business plans to invest in Colorado, employ Colorado workers, and deliver a modern, customer-focused experience for thousands of future Scout owners in the state,” said Thacker.",https://cdcssl.ibsrv.net/cimg/www.carsdirect.com/618x348_100/432/spare-wheel-stored-in-a-traveler-759432.jpg,N,,2026-01-01 04:58:18.922123

Charging an EV in Indiana usually costs less than filling up a similar gas car, especially if you plug in at home - roughly $10-$15 for a full charge. Check this post by the Indy Auto Man dealer’s practitioners for a general overview and some details on Indianapolis EV costs.

For drivers around Indianapolis, what you actually pay depends on your local electric rate, how efficient your EV is, and how often you rely on highway fast chargers instead of home charging points.

Home charging in Indiana

Most EV owners in and around Indiana do the bulk of their charging at home because it is usually the cheapest way to power. Recent estimates put the average residential electricity rate in Indiana at around 16 cents per kWh, which is roughly in line with or a bit below national numbers, depending on when you look. Rate details from AES Indiana show energy charges around 10–11 cents per kWh before riders and fees, which aligns with those statewide averages once everything is included.

To get a feel for what “a full charge” costs, just multiply your battery size by your cost per kWh. For example, charging a 60 kWh battery from very low to full at 16 cents per kWh runs about 60×0.16=9.6060 \times 0.16 = 9.6060×0.16=9.60 dollars, while a larger 100 kWh pack would be around 16 dollars for a full charge at home.

EV charge cost per mile vs. gas

Looking at the cost per mile makes it much easier to compare an EV to a gas vehicle. Many newer EVs average about 3–4 miles per kWh, so at 16 cents per kWh, you are paying roughly 4–5 cents per mile if you mostly charge at home. A typical gasoline sedan that gets 30 mpg at 3 dollars per gallon comes out to about 10 cents per mile, so Indiana drivers often see home-charged EV miles costing about half as much as gas miles.

Over a month, national EV cost calculators using 12,000 miles per year suggest home charging bills in the ballpark of 40–60 dollars for an efficient electric sedan, compared to more than 100 dollars in gasoline for a similar car. Bigger electric SUVs and trucks will use more energy per mile, but they still usually beat their gas counterparts on “fuel” cost when most charging happens at residential rates.

Public Level 2 and DC fast charging

Public Level 2 chargers in Indiana, like the ones you might see at offices, downtown garages, or shopping centers, often bill by the kWh or by the hour, and some locations still offer free charging for customers. When you do pay, Level 2 energy usually ends up near or a bit higher than what you pay at home, with the main benefit being that you can add range while you are out and about.

Costs jump the most with DC fast charging along interstates and busy routes around Indianapolis. Studies of major fast-charging networks show a lot of Indiana and national pricing in the 0.40–0.50 dollars per kWh range or higher, and one AES Indiana filing for its own DC fast chargers lists a flat session fee plus roughly 0.36 dollars per kWh. At those rates, a 60 kWh fast-charge stop on a road trip can easily land above 25 dollars, which starts to look similar to or even higher than what some drivers pay for gas on that same stretch.

Indiana-focused examples on how much charging an EV costs

Looking at a typical Indy commute and EV charging locations makes the numbers feel more concrete. Say you drive an EV that averages 3.5 miles per kWh and you commute 30 miles a day, mostly charging at home at 16 cents per kWh. You would use about 8.6 kWh per day, or around 2.75 dollars in electricity, which comes out to roughly 55–60 dollars per month for your commute and everyday errands.

Now picture two road-trip stops at Indiana fast chargers. If that same EV needs 50 kWh at a DC fast charger priced at 0.45 dollars per kWh plus a small session fee, you are looking at a little over 20 dollars for that one stop, which is still reasonable but clearly more expensive than filling up at home. On a long highway trip with multiple fast-charging sessions, your cost per mile can creep up near or even above that of a very efficient gas car, especially if you are driving a larger electric SUV or truck.

AI models could now use heavy amounts of compute power to ""think,"" which helped deliver more complex answers with greater accuracy. AI also got some agentic legs, meaning it could go out onto the internet and do tasks for you, like plan a vacation or order a pizza.

Despite these advancements, we might still be far off from artificial general intelligence, or AGI. This is a theoretical future when AI becomes so good that it's indistinguishable from (or better than) human intelligence. Right now, an AI system works in a vacuum and doesn't really understand the world around us. It can mimic intelligence and string words together to make it sound like it understands. But it doesn't. Using AI daily has shown me that we still have a ways to go before we reach AGI.

As the AI industry reaches monstrous valuations, companies are moving quickly to meet Wall Street demands. Google, OpenAI, Anthropic and others are throwing trillions in training and infrastructure costs to usher in the next technological revolution. While the spend might seem absurd, if AI does truly upend how humanity works, then the rewards could be enormous. At the same time, as revolutionary as AI is, it constantly messes up and gets things wrong. It's also flooding the internet with slop content -- such as amusing short-form videos that may be profitable but are seldom valuable.

Humanity, which will be the beneficiary or sufferer of AI, deserves better. If our survival is literally at stake, then at the very least, AI could be substantively more helpful, rather than just a rote writer of college essays and nude image generators. Here are all the things that I, as an AI reporter, would like to see from the industry in 2026.

It's the environment

My biggest, most immediate concern around AI is the impact massive data centers will have on the environment. Before the AI revolution, the planet was already facing an existential threat due to our reliance on fossil fuels. Major tech companies stepped up with initiatives saying they'd aim to reach net-zero emissions by a certain date. Then ChatGPT hit the scene.

Don't miss any of our unbiased tech content and lab-based reviews. Add CNET as a preferred Google source.

With the massive power demand of AI, including Wall Street's insatiable need for profitability, data centers are turning back to fossil fuels like methane gas to keep the GPUs humming, the tools that perform the complex calculations to string words and pixels together.

There's something incredibly dystopian about the end of the planet coming at the hands of ludicrous AI-generated videos of kittens bulking up at the gym.

Whenever I get an opportunity, I ask companies like Google, OpenAI and Nvidia what they're doing to ensure AI data centers don't pollute the water or air. They say they're still committed to reaching emissions targets but seldom give specific details. I suspect they aren't quite sure what the plan is yet, either. Maybe AI will give them the answer?

At the very least, I'm glad that the US is reconsidering nuclear energy. It's an efficient and largely pollution-free energy source. It's just a bit sad that it's market demands that'll bring back nuclear and not politicians fighting to protect the planet. At least the US can take inspiration from Europe, where nuclear energy is more common. It's just frustrating that it takes five or more years to build a new plant.

I want my phone to be smarter

For the past three years, smartphone makers such as Apple, Samsung and Google have been touting new AI features in their handsets. Often, these presentations show how AI could help edit photos or clean up texts. Even then, consumers have been underwhelmed by AI in smartphones. I don't blame them. People turn to smartphones for quality snaps, communication or social media. These AI features feel more like extras than must-haves.

Here's the thing: AI has the capability to fix many pain points in smartphone usage. The technology is way better at things like vocal transcription, translation and answering questions than past ""smart"" features. The problem is that for AI to do these things well, it requires a lot of computing. And when somebody is trying to use speech-to-text, they don't have time to wait for their audio to be uploaded to Google's cloud so that it can be transcribed and beamed back to their phone. Even if the process takes 10 seconds, that's still too long in the middle of a back-and-forth text chain.

Local AI models are available to run on-device to do these sorts of quick tasks. The problem is that the models still aren't capable of getting it right all the time. As a result, things can feel haphazard, with quality transcriptions working only some of the time. I'm hoping that in 2026, local AI on phones can get to a point where it just works.

I also want to see local AI models on phones that can be more agentic. Google has a feature on Pixel phones called Magic Cue. It can automatically pull from your email and text data and intuitively add Maps directions to a coffee date. Or if you're texting about a flight, it can automatically pull up the flight information. This kind of seamless integration is what I want from AI on mobile, not reimagining photos in cartoon form.

Magic Cue is still in its early stages, and it doesn't work all the time or as you'd suspect. If Google, OpenAI or other companies can figure this out, that's when I do feel consumers will really start to appreciate AI on phones.

Is this AI?

Scrolling through Instagram Reels or TikTok, whenever I see something truly charming, funny or out of the ordinary, I immediately rush to the comments to see if it's AI.

AI video models are becoming increasingly convincing. Gone are wonky movements, 12 fingers and perfectly centered shots with uncanny perfection. AI videos on social now mimic security camera footage and handheld videos, and added filters can obscure the AI-ness of a video.

I'm tired of the guessing game. I want both Meta and TikTok to straight-up declare if the video uploaded was made with AI. Meta actually does have systems in place to try and determine if something uploaded was made with generative AI, but it's inconsistent. TikTok is also working on AI detection. I'm not entirely sure how the platforms can do so accurately, but it'd certainly make life on social far less of a puzzle.

Sora and Google do have watermarks for AI-generated videos. But these are getting easier to evade, and many people are using Chinese AI models, such as Wan, to generate videos. While Wan does add a watermark, people can find ways to download those videos without it. It shouldn't be incumbent upon a few in the comments section to delineate whether a video is AI or not. (There are even subreddits that survey users trying to discern if a video is AI.)

We need clarity.

I'm tired of the constant guesswork. C'mon, Meta and TikTok -- what's the point of all the billions in AI investment? Just tell me if a video on your platform is AI.",https://www.cnet.com/a/img/resize/637a4d749e079618cf8b715975b255948fad6f9b/hub/2025/12/29/a553678d-a231-4284-85af-01d688b1cbba/gettyimages-2252210703.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200,N,,2026-01-01 05:12:44.115574

While Indiana lawmakers typically schedule most new laws to begin July 1, some provisions are delayed until the start of the year. For 2026, several of those changes center on taxes, along with a mix of unrelated measures affecting daily life for Hoosiers.

Property tax changes begin phasing in

Several provisions of Senate Enrolled Act 1, Indiana’s major property tax reform law, take effect Jan. 1, 2026.

The law reduces property taxes by increasing exemptions and deductions so less of a property’s value is taxed.

For 2026, the standard homestead deduction will remain at $48,000. At the same time, the supplemental deduction will increase from 37.5% to 40%. The standard deduction will gradually phase out and be eliminated by 2031, while the supplemental deduction will rise to two-thirds of a property’s value by that year.

A new homestead tax credit will also take effect. Property owners will receive a credit equal to $300 or 10% of their property tax bill, whichever amount is lower.

Additional changes include the elimination of the 30% tax floor on depreciated business equipment purchased in 2026 or later, meaning businesses will no longer be required to pay taxes on at least 30% of the original purchase price.

Rental properties and farmland will also receive a new supplemental deduction that begins at 6% in 2026 and increases to one-third of the gross assessed value by 2031.

The Department of Local Government Finance is required to launch an online property tax transparency portal by Jan. 1. The portal is intended to allow property owners to compare their current tax bill with alternative tax rates and provide feedback to state and local governments.

State income tax decrease

Indiana’s state income tax rate will decrease slightly at the start of the year, dropping from 3% to 2.95%.

The reduction stems from the 2023 budget cycle. For someone earning $100,000 annually, the change amounts to about $50 in yearly savings.

SNAP purchase restrictions

Under Indiana’s “Smart SNAP” initiative, SNAP recipients will no longer be allowed to use benefits to purchase certain sugary snacks and drinks.

According to the Family and Social Services Administration, the change affects about 450,000 Hoosiers and roughly 5,000 retailers statewide.

Data privacy updates

A consumer data privacy law will give Hoosiers new rights over how their personal data is collected and used by companies.

Consumers can request access to their personal data, correct inaccuracies, request deletion under certain conditions and opt out of targeted advertising.

Businesses are required to disclose how data is collected and used, implement reasonable security practices and respond to verified consumer requests. The Indiana Attorney General’s office is responsible for enforcement, with an emphasis on compliance.

Other laws taking effect Jan. 1

Several additional provisions begin with the new year:

Under House Enrolled Act 1380, electric vehicle registration fees will no longer apply to motorcycle owners.

Senate Enrolled Act 108 limits facilities that host bingo or casino game nights to no more than three nights per week.

House Enrolled Act 1004 requires the Department of Health to establish a reporting process for violations related to health insurance commission disclosures.

House Enrolled Act 1285 requires schools to ensure at least one employee on site during the school year has received nonviolent crisis intervention training.

Senate Enrolled Act 331 requires drivers who change a vehicle’s color through paint or vinyl wraps to notify the Bureau of Motor Vehicles within 30 days. Failure to do so could result in a warning from law enforcement.

Both chambers of the Indiana General Assembly will reconvene for the 2026 legislative session on Monday, Jan. 5, at 1:30 p.m.",https://www.wishtv.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/28/BRAUN-BILL-SIGNINGS-VO.transfer.transfer_frame_290.jpg,N,,2026-01-01 00:13:03.800327

My V-Dub is the latest in a line that dates back to the original Rabbit-based GTI from1976 — the car that arguably launched the “hot hatch” segment.
“The decline in hot hatch popularity since the ‘90s can be attributed to several factors: Changing consumer preferences toward SUVs and many (automakers) deciding to exit the sedans and coupes market,” said Owen Peacock, general manager of Toyota Marketing.
It’s a long drive and I have plenty of time to ponder the state of hot hatches in America.
“We keep these cars relevant by continuously refining their driving dynamics, powertrains and technology to meet modern expectations while preserving the core excitement that defines a hot hatch,” Peacock said.","It’s noon, and I’m sitting in Jackson, Tennessee, a waypoint on Interstate 40 an hour east of Memphis. My husband calls and wants to know if I’ll be home in Indianapolis for dinner. I look at the Volkswagen GTI while knowing there are hours of challenging roads ahead.

“Yeah, I’ll be there,” I said. I threw my bags under the hatch, slid into the tartan-upholstered seats, and stomped the turbo-four onto the highway.

My V-Dub is the latest in a line that dates back to the original Rabbit-based GTI from1976 — the car that arguably launched the “hot hatch” segment. They’re practical rides with enough sporting pleasure to fill weekend back roads with revving engines, tight suspensions and crisp transmissions. The GTI is also affordable at $32,445.

While there once was an array of choices for enthusiasts, it’s waned precipitously since the 1990s.

“The decline in hot hatch popularity since the ‘90s can be attributed to several factors: Changing consumer preferences toward SUVs and many (automakers) deciding to exit the sedans and coupes market,” said Owen Peacock, general manager of Toyota Marketing.

It’s a long drive and I have plenty of time to ponder the state of hot hatches in America.

The Honda Civic Type R could have taught my V-Dub a few lessons since it broke the front-drive lap record time of 7 minutes 44.881 seconds on Germany’s treacherous Nürburgring. To accomplish that feat, it employed a 315-horsepower 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine, six-speed manual transmission, Brembo brakes, wing and adaptive suspension. All that for $45,895.

Who buys cars like this?

“It’s a very specific product purchase,” said Jonathon Rivers, the department lead for customer experience at American Honda Motor Co. “It’s somebody who knows every single detail about that car — need a track-capable vehicle, but something that’s also reliable and with extra usability. It’s an awesome blend of a visceral experience, but owners can switch drive modes and put things in the huge hatch.”

How has Honda addressed what these buyers really want?

“What makes the Type-R stand out is its heritage,” Rivers said. “It stands out because it is front-wheel-drive when many competitors use AWD. With dual axis front suspension technology, you can still put the power down and provide a very dynamic driving experience. It has a big wing on the back, scoop on the hood, but still looks very mature.”

If that seems intense, Honda also introduced a Civic Hybrid Hatchback for 2025 dishing 200 horsepower and 50/45 MPG city/highway. Hybrid hatches start at $30,495.

“It’s been great, Car of the Year — done very well from a customer perspective,” Rivers continued. “It brings us a lot of credibility with the Honda Prelude.”

Indeed, nostalgia bites harder for 2026 as Honda marks a new Prelude sport coupe that looks equal parts Porsche and Civic, employing the latter’s hybrid system and chassis from the Typer R. Combined system output including the 2.0-liter engine totals 200 horsepower. Leather-trimmed sport seats with houndstooth pattern, flat-bottom steering wheel and Bose audio encourage grand touring. Load the hatch and go.

Interstate 40 across Tennessee is not the Nürburgring, but it can feel like it when chicaning semis through sweeping hills and a fast crossing of the Tennessee River. Across hill and dale, the GTI is rock steady at triple digits with one hand on the wheel. The 2.0-liter turbo-four dances with 241 horsepower and available adaptive suspension.

If I was going to choose another whip, I’d consider the Toyota GR Corolla. This is not your nephew’s dorm shuttle! Developed by Toyota’s GAZOO Racing, the widened hatchback employs a 1.6-liter turbo-three engine dishing 300 horsepower through a six-speed manual transmission (automatic optional) and all-wheel-drive. Deeply bolstered seats and a head-up display encourage track days. Prices start at $39,160.

“Our performance hatchbacks attract a passionate, diverse group,” Peacock said. “Typically, these buyers are driving enthusiasts who value a blend of everyday practicality and spirited performance. They tend to be younger professionals or enthusiasts who want a car that’s fun to drive — whether it’s for spirited canyon runs or just enjoying a dynamic daily driver.”

I strafe Nashville before pointing North. Passing through Bowling Green, Kentucky, I spot the red spire of the National Corvette Museum. America’s dream car straddles the worlds of gas-burning Nirvana and the EV age with two hybrids. Which makes me wonder about the future of hot hatches.

We get a hint with the all-electric Hyundai Ioniq 5 N, boasting 641 horsepower, 221-mile range and 0-60 mph in 3.25 seconds. It sports out with a lowered suspension and sueded seats. You know you’re going to have fun when a car has a “drift optimizer” and “N Grin Boost” for optimum acceleration — all for $66,200.

Going further, Hyundai recently unveiled the Concept Three with compact three-door profile looking like a next-generation Veloster. It’s interior trades giant touchscreens for smaller screens around the steering wheel while integrating recycled wool and aluminum.

Looking 10 years into the future, how will this segment look?

“There are opportunities for a multitude of platforms and powertrains to co-exist,” Rivers said. “It’s up to customers. The reason you want a hot hatchback is because it’s fast and fun to drive. There’s always a way to evolve, like with automated shifting and sound technology, that take what made those cars great and bring it forward.”

As much as I’m enjoying my romp across the Ohio River, I can’t help but wonder how long VW’s party can last. No worries, as it showed its first all-electric GTI Concept that channels the original 1976 model’s DNA into a sleek two-box design with augmented reality head-up display. Digital instruments simulate gauges from classics.

“We keep these cars relevant by continuously refining their driving dynamics, powertrains and technology to meet modern expectations while preserving the core excitement that defines a hot hatch,” Peacock said. “Our focus remains on delivering engaging, driver-focused vehicles that offer a thrilling experience on every drive.”

I roll into the driveway at 5:30 and call my co-worker back in Jackson. She’s in disbelief.

Our region is fortunate to have a community foundation, especially one that is a hub for these partnerships. Together, we are carrying out the Community Foundation Southwest Louisiana mission of connecting people who care with causes that matter.

Did you know the Greek root of philanthropy may be literally translated as “loving people”? A shining example of philanthropy is the Just Imagine SWLA 50 Year Resilience Plan which was sparked by a transformational $2.5 million gift to the Community Foundation from Angela and David Filo. That generosity launched our community’s vision, the Just Imagine SWLA plan, which continues to be implemented through a team effort. 2025 saw the opening of the first phase of the Mid City Neighborhood Transformation project. When completed, the area will consist of more than 500 units of new, resilient, mixed-income housing at Lake and 18th Streets. Once completed in its entirety, the neighborhood will include a new park, buildings constructed to Fortified Gold standards, and opportunities for small businesses to start-up and thrive.

People are giving generously to causes that matter most to them, whether close to home or across the world. This year, individuals, families and companies who give through charitable funds at the Community Foundation, such as Donor Advised Funds, gave over $2.4 million to 188 organizations! Through their generosity, these donors advanced missions in education, social services, and arts and culture. A local Mardi Gras krewe created a fund to offer a unique way to honor members of their Royal Court. This was the first fund of its kind established at the Community Foundation and will be used to support meaningful causes selected by the Krewe of Mystique.

Nonprofits in our region are fortunate that some individuals and families choose to create endowment funds to support their favorite causes both during their lifetimes and through their wills. Recent examples include a family establishing funds to benefit Catholic Charities and the Haiti Education Mission at Good Shepherd Episcopal Church, as well as another family whose endowment supports the Children’s Museum of Southwest Louisiana. These legacy funds ensure that the causes chosen by the donors will be supported forever.

Some individuals choose to establish endowments that are funded entirely through their wills. One such individual was Beverly Schalon, a longtime chemist and quality professional at PPG, who passed away last December. Beverly created an endowment fund to provide annual support for causes that were important to her and her late husband, David, including their three universities, United Way of Southwest Louisiana, and the Community Foundation.

Corporate partners play a vital role in our region’s philanthropy through the Community Foundation. Area industries, in collaboration with the Foundation, are providing scholarships through their Women in Industry program. Sempra Energy funds career coaching and counseling for their scholarship recipients at SOWELA. Cameron LNG’s Employee Giving Program provides quarterly grants to local nonprofits selected by their employees. Through Woodside Energy’s LEAD Program at Sulphur High School, students selected the Just Imagine project focused on Strong Downtowns. The mural on the side of Village Coffee House, along with the planter boxes and banners throughout downtown Sulphur, showcases the leadership skills students gained and the community impact made possible through corporate philanthropy.

We love sharing these stories through the American Press, social media and in person with civic clubs, classrooms, and community groups across SWLA—from Rotary clubs to Boards of local nonprofits. If you or your organization would like to learn more about supporting a cause that is important to you, we’d be glad to visit and continue the conversation.

AND IT WILL BE VERY SHORT LIVED AS WELL, BECAUSE AS WE GO INTO NEXT WEEK, WE ARE EXPECTING THAT OUR TEMPERATURES WILL WARM RIGHT BACK UP HERE AS WE HAVE MORE OF A SOUTHERLY WIND COMING UP FROM THE GULF, AND THAT SHOULD HELP GET RID OF SOME OF THAT COOLER AIR AND REPLACE IT WITH WARMER AIR, ESPECIALLY ON TUESDAY. I THINK YOU’LL NOTICE A BIGGER DIFFERENCE THERE WITH TEMPERATURES. MORE ON THAT HERE IN A SECOND ON THAT SEVEN DAY FORECAST. BUT REALLY QUICKLY, THOUGH, THE SUGAR BOWL FORECAST OF COURSE THAT’S A BIG GAME HAPPENING ON THURSDAY 7:00 AT THE SUPERDOME. KICKOFF INCREASING CLOUDS 60 DEGREES. AND I DO THINK THE CLOUDS WILL STICK AROUND. I’M NOT EXPECTING ANY RAIN THOUGH. TEMPERATURES WILL BE INTO THE MID 50S BY HALFTIME AND BY THE END OF THE GAME TOO. AND YOUR WDSU FIRST WARNING SEVEN DAY FORECAST. LOOKING GOOD. LOOKING AT THOSE INCREASING CLOUDS OUT AHEAD OF THAT SYSTEM. THAT’S GOING TO BRING US THAT COOL FRONT. SO FRIDAY AND SATURDAY LOOK PRETTY WARM. PARTLY TO MOSTLY CLOUDY THERE. SUNDAY PARTLY CLOUDY STILL, BUT HIGH TEMPERATURES DROPPING INTO THE MID 60S. AND THEN WE’RE WARMING UP A LITTLE BIT INTO THE UPPER 60S ON MONDAY. STILL PARTLY CLOUDY AND THEN INCREASING. CLOUDS ARE LIKELY COMING UP TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY, BUT THEN OUR TEMPERATURES WARM RIGHT BACK UP INTO THOSE LOW TO MID 70S. AND OUR LOW TEMPERATURES. ALSO, RESPONDING TO THAT COLD FRONT COMING IN, WE DROP FROM THE 60S ON SATURDAY ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THE 40S AND LOWER 5

Fossil fuel–backed activists and groups have for years been spreading misinformation about wind turbines harming whales.","Think of the Washington Monument. Imagine it sitting on the surface of the sea, with blades as long as a football field slowly spinning. It’s futuristic and white with rounded edges, like a rocketship. But there are no blasts or flares. There is no noise at all but calling gulls.

Sitting on the stern of a shrimp boat in early November, this is what I saw. The captain steered us directly under one of two ​“pilot” turbines. In the distance, I saw foundations for 176 more, poking a few dozen feet out of the sea. The Hoover Dam came to mind, another landmark feat of energy engineering. Each new turbine will be roughly the same height as the famous dam, from blade tip to the surf below.

“Why do people think they are an eyesore? Doesn’t bother me none,” said the captain, Bob Crisher, a commercial fisherman. He’s in favor of the wind farm and believes it will bring down his electricity bills.

Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind, America’s largest planned offshore wind farm, was then being built about 27 miles east of Virginia Beach. It’s slated to power up to 660,000 homes in a region with the highest concentration of data centers in the world. With energy demand skyrocketing and electricity costs rising, Virginia needs the last construction push on this project to go smoothly. The developer, utility Dominion Energy, promised the turbines would start feeding the grid by March 2026.

How quickly things fell apart.

Last week, the Trump administration ordered a pause on all five in-progress offshore wind projects in America — including Virginia’s — citing unspecified risks to ​“national security.” It was the largest blow yet to a once-growing industry that Trump has brought to its knees in just 11 months. While Trump spent much of 2025 slowing the incredible rise of renewables, his unrelenting war on so-called ​“windmills” has been more vicious and personal.

In many ways, Trump’s attacks on offshore wind this year encapsulate this new era of politics. He throttles long-held norms in favor of retribution and personal grievance, acting with dizzying speed. He contorts facts and pushes officials in his administration to do the same.

Left in the wake are everyday citizens — including dozens I’ve interviewed over the past year — who are losing the prospect of good-paying jobs. They and their neighbors are also losing access to public goods like lower emissions, revitalized ports, reliable electricity, and a buffer against skyrocketing power bills driven by an AI boom.

Trump’s grudge against offshore wind began more than a decade ago, when he tried — and failed — to stop 11 turbines from being built within view of one of his Scottish golf courses. He has been disparaging offshore wind turbines as ​“ugly” and ​“eyesores” ever since.

He cranked up the intensity when he embarked on his second presidential campaign in 2023, branding big ocean turbines as dangerous. “[W]indmills are causing whales to die in numbers never seen before,” he said that year — a false statement. Still, attacking offshore wind seemed little more than an odd punchline for his campaign rallies. After all, the Trump administration backed the sector for much of his first presidential term, executing multiple offshore wind auctions that had been queued up by the Obama administration.

But Trump’s hyperactive second term has turned fringe movements and personal grudges into full-blown policies. Like his attacks on vaccines and higher education, his blitz on offshore wind farms is having far-reaching implications that will take years to fully enumerate.

Here’s some initial accounting: In-development wind projects have been paused, delayed, and paused again. One fell apart. Two are essentially mothballed after Trump sunsetted wind tax credits. Port revitalizations got cancelled. Developers lost billions. Related manufacturing is drying up. Tens of thousands of once-promised jobs may never be created. Workers already on the job are sitting idle.

One Trump-voting fisherman called the president’s anti-wind campaign ​“madness.”

But while vaccines and universities will endure through Trump’s political attacks, in one form or another, the U.S. offshore wind industry may not. Despite the ubiquity of offshore turbines in northern Europe and China, there is only one large-scale wind farm fully operational in American waters today. When Trump moved back into the White House, the industry was just taking off.

J. Timmons Roberts, a Brown University professor of environmental studies who tracks opposition to offshore wind, put it simply: ​“They’re killing the baby while it’s still in the cradle.”

Dismantling offshore wind

When Trump’s first term ended, there were no federally approved plans for offshore wind farms. When President Joe Biden left office, there were nearly a dozen — and at least 40 more were in various stages of planning and early development in waters along the East Coast from Maine down to the Carolinas, across the Gulf of Mexico, and along the California coast.

But, on the first day of his second term, Trump signed an executive order that froze offshore wind permitting, blocking proposed projects that didn’t already have federal approval. And he ordered a new review of the projects that did have federal permits but were not yet fully completed, throwing their future into doubt. (The executive order was ultimately struck down by a federal court on December 9.)

Unease amongst state leaders, developers, and investors immediately took root.

Within days, the first permitted project began to fall apart due to ​“uncertainty” over federal actions. In late January, Shell — one of two developers of the Atlantic Shores wind farm slated to be built east of New Jersey — announced it was withdrawing from the project. New Jersey then abandoned plans to purchase power from the installation. The final blow came weeks later when Trump’s Environmental Protection Agency revoked a Clean Air Act permit for the project. One former EPA official called the move ​“unusual.”

Research cuts and funding clawbacks soon followed.

In May, Lincoln Varnum was called into his supervisor’s office at the University of Maine, where he worked as an instrumentation engineer. Varnum was one of nine employees laid off from the university’s high-profile engineering and offshore-wind research center due to the Trump administration pausing funding. The administration also cancelled federal funding for Maine’s first floating offshore wind array, which had been fully permitted; the project was then mothballed.

“I obviously got a little emotional in the meeting … Something that I cared about was getting terminated,” Varnum told me. ​“It was also the first time I had ever been laid off.”

He sees himself and others who’ve been working on offshore wind as collateral damage.

In the following weeks, Varnum, who once identified as a conservative, was hopeful that Maine’s Republican members of Congress would speak up about the funding cuts, but none of them did — not even Sen. Susan Collins, a long-time offshore-wind supporter. He described Collins’ silence as ​“rough,” especially since he had voted for Collins in the past.

“We’re a poor state. We need industry. To have a new industry that is unique to us, floating offshore wind, now targeted by the feds … It feels like a kick in the teeth,” said Varnum.

Trump yanked funding in other ways.

In September, the Department of Transportation pulled back $679 million for infrastructure projects that supported offshore wind, including one that would have cleaned up and revitalized a massive California port. Mandy Davis, a California resident and anti-wind activist, aligns herself with Trump’s false narrative that turbines harm the ocean environment. She was elated by cuts that might block turbine construction in California’s waters, but her joy was short-lived.

In November, when the Trump administration announced plans for new oil drilling off the California coast, she told me it was a ​“betrayal.”

New England communities, which spent over a decade preparing to build America’s first offshore wind farms, also felt betrayed. Prior to Trump’s December halt, two massive projects had been paused by the Interior Department earlier in the year. One of the projects, Revolution Wind off the coast of Rhode Island, was already 80 percent completed.

“It’s like having the rug pulled out from under you,” Jack Morris, a Massachusetts-based scalloper and Trump voter, told me earlier this year. ​“Nobody understands why Trump did it. I don’t know what Trump’s agenda is.”

Revolution Wind had employed 80 local fishermen, including Morris, to help with construction. The project’s pause caused Morris and others to lose some of the part-time income that has them pay their bills as fishing revenues dry up.

The stop-work orders for Revolution Wind and New York’s Empire Wind were each lifted or reversed after about a month. But some damage was permanent. According to Harrison Sholler, an energy analyst for BloombergNEF, the orders were a signal to companies that America is not a sound investment. Foreign firms had invested heavily in the sector, lost billions, and are now looking for the door.

Trump’s more sweeping wind halt last week only reinforced that assessment.

What America lost

“What exactly will America have lost? How do you even begin to answer that question?” pondered Elizabeth Wilson, a professor of environmental studies at Dartmouth College.

We could start by looking at how much new electricity capacity won’t be added to America’s increasingly strained grid.

Before Trump was elected last November, BNEF expected 39 gigawatts of offshore wind to be built in the U.S. by 2035. BNEF’s latest forecast is for just 6 gigawatts by 2035 — and even that number could come down thanks to Trump’s latest pause.

Another lens is employment. Together, the five wind farms currently underway have been slated to generate about 10,000 jobs. Now some of the highly skilled workers who have already trained for those projects face an uncertain future. And the 77,000 offshore wind jobs that the Biden administration had projected the country would see in the coming decades may never materialize.

Varnum, the laid-off engineer, said that if Maine’s nascent offshore wind industry rises from the ashes sometime in the future, he ​“certainly would want to help. It’s not something I’m turning my back on.”

He has since found a job working for a hydroelectric company. But Varnum said he fears for America’s energy future and how far Trump might take his broader war on carbon-free energy. The president has already boosted fossil-fuel production and nuclear power while trying to tamp down clean energy. His political revenge against offshore wind may be paving the way for more.

“The guy torpedoes us on Day One and how far is he going to go? How far will this go?” wonders Varnum.

Wilson of Dartmouth says that Trump’s assault on offshore wind is ultimately a battle over facts and truth.

Fossil fuel–backed activists and groups have for years been spreading misinformation about wind turbines harming whales. They lit the match and Trump fanned the flames. The president ranted and made false claims about offshore wind throughout 2025, in front of reporters, foreign heads of state, and the entire United Nations General Assembly

“There’s no proof, right? There are no receipts,” Sen. Martin Heinrich, Democrat of New Mexico, told me in June. He said the administration hid the report and then used the permitting process as a ​“political tool,” something he sees as typical of ​“a banana republic.”

Without new offshore turbines going up, millions of households across the Northeast will soon pay more money for dirtier and less reliable electricity. According to a recent report, offshore wind power could help keep the lights on year-round in the Northeast and mid-Atlantic regions, especially during harsh winter weather when gas plants can fail. Cuts to planet-warming pollution, mandated by several East Coast states, are also now out of reach. All signs point to Trump’s second term creating a hotter and less affordable future for Americans.

Few people interviewed for this story expressed hope that the damage from Trump’s war on ​“windmills” could be reversed anytime soon.

“What Trump really killed was hope,” said Wilson. ​“And what is the value of hope?”",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/CVOW-pic_2026-01-01-003028_vjrk.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=86fdfe6f13b9f5c28b31fafce2c01c83,N,,2025-12-31 19:57:21.628712

The move to keep the Craig plant open had been expected for weeks .
“Going backwards is an attempt to force local communities to foot the bill to extend plant operations, and will cost energy consumers more.
Craig Mayor Chris Nichols welcomed the news of the emergency order, but stated that Craig should continue the work of preparing for a possible economic transition within the community.
“Those needless costs are likely to be borne by electricity customers in Colorado and nearby states,” Earth Justice stated.","President Donald Trump’s Energy Department is ordering a coal-burning power plant in northwest Colorado to remain open just one day before it was scheduled to shut down.

U.S. Department of Energy Secretary Chris Wright issued an emergency order on Tuesday requiring Craig Station’s Unit 1 plant in Moffat County to keep running until at least March 30, 2026, with an extension possible. The plant was set to close on Wednesday, Dec. 31.

The order was issued under section 202(c) of the Federal Power Act, which allows the Energy Department to keep power plants running during times of crisis, such as war or energy shortages. The move to keep the Craig plant open had been expected for weeks .

Wright’s order claims that Colorado and other Western states face an energy “emergency” due to a “shortage of electric energy, a shortage of facilities for the generation of electric energy, and other causes.”

The closure of coal-burning plants “could lead to the loss of power to homes,” the order states, as well as “businesses in the areas that may be affected by curtailments or power outages, presenting a risk to public health and safety.”

The Trump administration has used similar justifications under the Federal Power Act to keep open coal plants in Michigan and Washington, as well as an oil plant in Pennsylvania.

Gov. Jared Polis, in a statement on Wednesday, condemned the decision, claiming that keeping the Craig plant open will “pass tens of millions in costs to Colorado rate payers.”

He added that the plant is “broken and not needed.”

“Ludicrously, the coal plant isn’t even operational right now, meaning repairs — to the tune of millions of dollars — just to get it running, all on the backs of rural Colorado ratepayers!” Polis stated. “Going backwards is an attempt to force local communities to foot the bill to extend plant operations, and will cost energy consumers more. Today’s action flies in the face of this careful planning, is inconsistent with market forces, and will hurt Coloradans.”

The Craig Press sent questions to Tri-State Generation and Transmission Association, the utility cooperative that operates Craig Station, asking whether claims that the plant is “broken” are accurate and how it plans to respond to the emergency order.

A spokesperson said that Tri-State received the order at 6 p.m. last night and responded to questions with a statement saying that the plant, as a result of the order, “will likely require additional investments in operations, repairs, maintenance and, potentially, fuel supply, all factors increasing costs.”

Tri-State co-owns Craig Station’s Unit 1 alongside other utility providers, including Xcel Energy, the Platte River Power Authority and PacifiCorp.

“Tri-State has a policy of 100% compliance, and we will work with (the plant’s) co-owners, and federal and state governments to determine the most cost-effective path to that end,” said Tri-State CEO Duane Highley, in a statement.

“We are continuing to review the order to determine what this means for Craig Station employees and operations, and the financial impacts,” Highley’s statement continued. “As a not-for-profit cooperative, our membership will bear the costs of compliance with this order unless we can identify a method to share costs with those in the region. There is not a clear path for doing so, but we will continue to evaluate our options.”

Tri-State originally decided to close the plant by the end of 2025 as part of its move to more environmentally-friendly energy sources. It plans to close the Craig station’s two other coal-burning plants by 2028.

The effort is partly driven by a state law that requires large-scale utility providers to reach 100% renewable electrical energy by 2050. Tri-State is also looking to transition to other energy sources for economic reasons, it said.

Craig Mayor Chris Nichols welcomed the news of the emergency order, but stated that Craig should continue the work of preparing for a possible economic transition within the community.

“It’s great for the community to keep those jobs active, even for a short period,” Nichols said in an interview on Wednesday. “But we need to continue what we’re going to do to replace good-paying jobs in the community, because it’s a short-term extension.”

U.S. Rep. Jeff Hurd, a Western Slope Republican whose sweeping 3rd Congressional District includes Moffat County, praised the emergency order in a statement on Wednesday, saying that Colorado’s energy policy “has been driven by ideology instead of reality.”

“Plants were scheduled to close to satisfy political timelines, even though the power was still needed and local economies would feel the loss,” stated Hurd, who has pushed for the Trump administration to keep another coal plant running in Pueblo , which is also in his district.

The state’s energy office and environmental advocates, however, are deeply critical of the decision.

Colorado Energy Office Executive Director Will Toor, in a statement, questioned the U.S. Energy Department’s use of the Federal Power Act, which he said provides the federal government “limited authority” to act during emergencies.

“Colorado does not have an energy emergency,” Toor stated.” In fact, the state, along with the rest of the region, has some of the most reliable power systems in the country.”

Toor pointed to a recent report by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation , a nonprofit regulatory group that assesses grid conditions and develops standards, that found there are no short- or long-term elevated reliability risks in the Rocky Mountain region.

The environmental group Earth Justice, also in a statement , claimed the emergency order was “illegal” and failed to provide evidence of any “actual emergency.”

The group also cited an analysis by Grid Strategies , a consulting firm that supports more clean energy, showing that if the plant remains open and generates its average output of the last few years, costs could rise to $20 million over 90 days, or approximately $85 million per year.

“Those needless costs are likely to be borne by electricity customers in Colorado and nearby states,” Earth Justice stated.

How much will be cut? And which tax?

Don’t believe candidates for the Governor’s Mansion (in either party) who pledge that they will eliminate state income taxes — no matter how loudly or how often they say it. For starters, the South Carolina governor doesn’t have the authority to unilaterally change tax policy. Period. That is entirely up to the 170-member Legislature.

Sen. Sean Bennett, who a year ago was considering a bid for governor, calls those campaign promises “pie in the sky.”

“They sound good, particularly in election years on the stump: ‘Let’s just eliminate our income tax,'” said the Summerville Republican.

The financial planner calculates the move would require at least doubling the state’s 6% sales tax: “I wish we wouldn’t waste time chasing that shiny lure.”

He is hopeful, however, about traction on the type of sweeping changes to the state tax code he’s advocated for years.

Legislation that further cuts state income taxes is in the Senate’s court, after passing the House by a vote of 68-46 in May during the last week of the 2025 legislative session.

What Congress did two months later provided a boost to state House GOP leadership’s arguments, though probably not in the way you’d think.

The “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” which President Donald Trump signed July 4, is expected to reduce state income taxes by $515.4 million in the fiscal year starting July 1, according to a recent analysis by the state Revenue and Fiscal Affairs Office. The state’s revenue forecasters expect the federal law to further reduce collections by $244 million in 2027-28 and $251 million in 2028-29, when some of its major provisions — such as no taxes on tips or overtime — will phase out, leaving tax impacts beyond that a mystery.

But there’s a giant “if” in those predictions. The reductions will occur if the Legislature adopts the federal tax code changes.

That’s what the General Assembly normally does: South Carolina is among just a handful of states to tax “federal taxable income.”

The argument for decoupling

But a major reason that House Republicans gave last session in pushing their tax restructuring plan was to decouple South Carolina’s income tax code from the federal system.

House GOP leaders recently told the SC Daily Gazette they believe the Trump-signed tax law — and state forecasters’ analysis of its impact to state tax collections — increase the need for South Carolina to untether and do its own thing.

“It shows what happens when we give away the tax-making authority of the General Assembly to Washington,” said Rep. Brandon Newton of Lancaster, chairman of House Ways and Means’ tax policy subcommittee, which advanced the bill he co-sponsored.

“We can’t be at the mercy of whatever D.C. does, whether it’s President Trump or President AOC,” he continued, referring to progressive Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, while stressing, “even though I agree with the changes made by President Trump.”

More importantly for the bill’s chances, the Senate’s budget chief agrees.

“We want to decouple from the feds,” said Senate Finance Chairman Harvey Peeler, R-Gaffney. “South Carolina doesn’t need to depend on Congress.”

Bennett, who chairs two of Senate Finance’s regular subcommittees, believes the “Big Beautiful Bill” not only strengthens the case that state tax collections should not be “dependent on the whims of the federal government,” it highlights the need for a total overhaul.

“Let us decouple and put together a South Carolina-focused, South Carolina-centric tax policy that supports our budget,” he said.

For him, that means making changes to the entire tax structure, not just further chipping away at income taxes. And for the first time in his 13 years in the Senate, he said, he senses a real possibility of that happening.

Senate Majority Leader Shane Massey said the debate should include finding a way to reduce property taxes. Those are the taxes he gets the most complaints about, he said, even though they’re collected by counties, not the state, to fund local government services and schools.

“I’m all for a further reduction in income taxes,” said the Edgefield Republican. However, “I don’t have any constituents telling me we should eliminate income taxes.”

Changing appearances

The bill passed by the House would reduce income tax collections overall by $400.3 million in year one.

House GOP advances new plan that initially cuts SC income taxes by $400M

That would not, however, benefit all taxpayers immediately. Whether you would pay less in the proposal’s first year depends on your income and how you file: 42% of filers would see a cut, 24% would owe more, while 33% would see no change whatsoever, according to the Revenue and Fiscal Affairs Office.

That’s an improvement from the bill as originally filed, which Republicans announced with much fanfare in the Statehouse lobby before the state’s fiscal experts could dissect it — an odd, cart-before-the-horse move. After their analysis showed the bill would actually increase taxes for nearly 60% of filers, the public backlash prompted a rewrite.

The amended bill collapses the state’s three tax rates into two, instead of moving to a single flat tax rate immediately, while promising to get there through a multi-year phase-in.

House GOP leaders point to the 2022 law that cut income taxes by more than $1 billion as proof that will happen sooner than later. That phase-in was expected to take five years. Instead, it was completed by the budget that took effect July 1.

That law passed unanimously in both chambers. Opposition to the current House GOP plan comes from two directions: The hardline House Freedom Caucus insists on the immediate elimination of state income taxes — which, by the way, still make up more than 40% of the state’s general fund revenue. Democrats argue it’s unnecessary and potentially harmful to the state’s fiscal health.

As I wrote back in April about the original bill, the push wasn’t really about cutting taxes — at least, not in year one. It’s about removing what the House’s chief budget writer, Ways and Means Chairman Bruce Bannister, calls the state’s “glaring black eye”: a tax structure that seems to be the highest in the Southeast, even though it’s not.

Even with completion of the 2022 law, the state’s top marginal income tax rate is 6%. That appears uncompetitive to our neighbors and beyond. Politicians like to point to that 6% rate when they tell voters that South Carolinians pay the highest taxes in the region. That claim is malarkey.

Because South Carolina taxes “federal taxable income,” rather than adjusted gross income as most states do, South Carolinians start their state tax forms with less income to tax, compared to what they’d file if they lived across the state border.

Their effective tax rate — what people actually pay — is comparatively low. Roughly 45% of tax filers actually pay no state income taxes at all.

Republicans want a “fair and flat” tax code that makes South Carolina stand out as a low-tax state, rather than appear the opposite. But numbers can be deceiving. That’s why the original proposal that brought the tax rate to a flat 3.99% in one fell swoop actually increased most people’s taxes.

If the Legislature adopts the tax code changes in the “Big, Beautiful Bill,” the overall cut to state income taxes would be bigger in the coming fiscal year: $515 million compared to the House GOP plan’s $400 million.

But the state’s tax rate would still appear out of whack.

“We’d still have the sticker shock problem,” Bannister told the Gazette.

“We need to get the rate down,” he said. “If we cut $500 million, we ought to do it in a way that lets us celebrate a historic tax rate decrease, not just that we’re following the feds.”

The House GOP plan would further put in state law the goal of someday, eventually eliminating state income taxes.

Just conforming to the federal code would make it “almost impossible” to also pass a bill restructuring state taxes, Bannister said.

The next move will be decided in Peeler’s committee after the Legislature returns Jan. 13.

The House bill, said the Gaffney Republican, is “heading in the right direction.”

Peeler said he wants to make sure whatever the Senate passes is an actual tax cut — a not-so-veiled swipe at the original House plan.

And, further emphasizing that the Senate will pass something, he repeated a line he’s known to make: “You can’t out-cut Harvey Peeler.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/income-tax-newser.jpg,N,,2025-12-31 21:12:36.800537

The Environmental Protection Agency has proposed a new Waters of the U.S. rule aimed at giving farmers and ranchers clearer guidance on what qualifies as a regulated waterway.

The proposed rule would revise how federal jurisdiction under the Clean Water Act is defined, a long-standing issue for agriculture where uncertainty over ditches, ponds, and seasonal waterways has raised compliance concerns.

“I think farmers need to express that this is a positive rule moving in the right direction, and express their support for the rule,” says Courtney Briggs, senior director of government affairs for the American Farm Bureau Federation.

Briggs says the updated definition could help landowners better understand when federal permits are required and when normal farming practices can continue without added regulation.

Briggs continues, “It’s important that the EPA and the Army Corps hear the voice of agriculture. They can go to regulations.gov and search for WOTUS and provide their comments there, or on our website at fb.org, searching WOTUS, and you can go to our advocacy page, and we have set it up for our members to engage.”

The American Farm Bureau Federation urges farmers and ranchers to weigh in before the public comment period closes. The organization says producer input is critical to ensure the rule provides clarity, consistency, and protects both water quality and agricultural operations.

“Folks have until January 5 to provide comments, and then the rest of the regulatory process needs to play out.

Trump vetoed drinking water pipeline legislation from Republican Rep. Lauren Boebert of Colorado, a longtime ally who broke with the president in November to release files on convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. He also vetoed legislation that would have given the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida more control of some of its tribal lands. The tribe was among groups suing the administration over an immigration detention center in the Everglades known as “ Alligator Alcatraz.”

Both bills had bipartisan support and had been noncontroversial until the White House announced Trump’s vetoes Tuesday night.

Trump appeared to acknowledge the tribe’s opposition to the detention facility in a letter to Congress explaining his veto. “The Miccosukee Tribe has actively sought to obstruct reasonable immigration policies that the American people decisively voted for when I was elected,” Trump wrote.

Trump did not allude to Boebert in his veto of her legislation, but raised concerns about the cost of the water pipeline at the heart of that bill.

Boebert, one of four House Republicans who sided with House Democrats early on to force the release of the Epstein files, shared a statement on social media suggesting that the veto may have been “political retaliation.”

“I sincerely hope this veto has nothing to do with political retaliation for calling out corruption and demanding accountability. Americans deserve leadership that puts people over politics,” her statement said. Boebert added in another post: “This isn’t over.”

The Florida legislation had been sponsored by Republican Rep. Carlos Gimenez, whom Trump has endorsed. Gimenez and the Miccosukee Tribe were not immediately available for comment on Wednesday.

When asked whether the vetoes were punishment, the White House did not answer and instead referred to Trump’s statements explaining the vetoes.

Congress can override the vetoes by a vote of two-thirds of the members of the House and the Senate, but it’s unclear if there’s enough support in the Republican-controlled chambers to do so, especially heading into a midterm election year where many of them will be on the ballot and many GOP members will count on Trump’s backing.

Boebert’s legislation, the “Finish the Arkansas Valley Conduit Act,” aimed to improve access to clean drinking water in eastern Colorado.

While the congresswoman has long been a staunch supporter of Trump, she found herself at odds with the president with her support this year for legislation that required the Justice Department to release files related to Epstein.

Trump fought the proposal before reversing in the face of growing Republican support for releasing the files. Members of his administration even met with Boebert in the White House Situation Room to discuss the matter, though she didn’t change her mind.

Republican Rep. Jeff Hurd of Colorado, who co-sponsored the legislation, said he was “deeply disappointed” by Trump’s veto.

“This was a bipartisan, unanimous bill passed by Congress to uphold a long-standing federal commitment to southeastern Colorado,” Hurd said in a statement.

He said the legislation did not authorize any new construction spending or expand the federal government’s original commitment to the pipeline project, but adjusted the terms of repaying its costs.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1411b20/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4123x2165+0+292/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F97%2Fd5%2Fdd1324de49689afa2657d24e1e28%2Fb49f83efca014b49855589bd6e1894ba.jpg,N,,2025-12-31 17:58:45.094773

The group has cited filings showing that compliance with earlier DOE orders at J.H.","A rapid succession of Section 202(c) emergency orders has forced utilities to keep more than 2 GW of coal capacity online in December alone, marking an unprecedented federal intervention in grid operations and triggering legal challenges from states and environmental groups. Across all orders issued since May 2025, the DOE has now stalled the retirement of at least 4.5 GW of coal capacity.

The Department of Energy (DOE) issued four additional Section 202(c) emergency orders in December, directing utilities and grid operators to halt the retirement of coal-fired units—a combined capacity of more than 2 GW—across three regions: the Pacific Northwest, Midwest, and Mountain West. The new orders extend the Trump administration’s unprecedented run of federal grid interventions to at least 16 separate orders since May 2025.

On December 30, the DOE ordered co-owners of the 430-MW Craig Station Unit 1 in Colorado to maintain the coal-fired unit’s availability through March 30, 2026. Earlier, on December 23, the DOE issued directives requiring CenterPoint Energy and Northern Indiana Public Service Co. to keep three coal units—Unit 2 at F.B. Culley and Units 17 and 18 at the Schahfer station in Indiana—online through March 23. The orders follow a December 16 directive to TransAlta to keep Centralia Generating Station Unit 2 in Washington available through March 16.

Since May, the DOE has significantly expanded its use of Section 202(c) authority to compel the continued operation of generation and transmission assets deemed critical to grid reliability. Orders have repeatedly required utilities, independent system operators, and balancing authorities to override planned retirements, environmental operating limits, and market-based outcomes by mandating unit availability, extended run-hours, and coordinated operating measures to address projected supply shortfalls. Although each directive is time-limited—most spanning 60 to 90 days—their cumulative frequency and broad geographic reach represent a marked escalation in federal intervention in day-to-day grid operations.

Federal Grid Interventions: The Timeline of Section 202(c) Orders in 2025

Since May 2025, the Department of Energy (DOE) has issued 16 emergency orders under Section 202(c) of the Federal Power Act directing grid operators and utilities to maintain specified fossil fuel units and other infrastructure. In May, DOE issued separate orders to MISO to keep the J.H. Campbell coal plant in Michigan online (May 23), renewed the order in August (Aug. 20), and extended it again on Nov. 18 through Feb. 17, 2026. Similar emergency directives have targeted Constellation Energy’s Eddystone generating units in Pennsylvania (orders issued in May and August, extended on Nov. 25 through Feb. 24, 2026), Talen Energy’s Wagner station in PJM (orders issued in July and October, continuing through Dec. 31, 2025), Duke Energy Carolinas units during extreme weather on June 24–25, and PREPA generation and transmission assets in Puerto Rico (orders issued in May, renewed in August, and extended on Nov. 12 through Feb. 10, 2026).

Additional December orders extended federal intervention to three new regions: TransAlta’s Centralia Unit 2 in Washington (Dec. 16 through March 16, 2026), Northern Indiana Public Service Company’s Schahfer Units 17 and 18 (Dec. 23 through March 23, 2026), CenterPoint Energy’s Culley Unit 2 in Indiana (Dec. 23 through March 23, 2026), and Tri-State’s Craig Station Unit 1 in Colorado (Dec. 30 through March 30, 2026).

So far, at least nine of the 16 Section 202(c) orders have targeted coal-fired units, collectively preventing the retirement of more than 4.5 GW of coal capacity across Michigan, Pennsylvania, Washington, Indiana, and Colorado through early 2026. For reference, approximately 166-172 GW of coal capacity was operational in the U.S. as of mid-2025, according to the Energy Information Administration.

DOE Overrides Colorado Regulators on Craig Unit 1 Closure

The most recent order, issued December 30, directs Tri-State Generation and Transmission Association, a not-for-profit generation and transmission electric cooperative, and its four co-owners—Platte River Power Authority, Salt River Project, PacifiCorp, and Xcel Energy—to keep Unit 1 at the Craig Station in northwestern Colorado available to operate through March 30, 2026.

Craig Station is a three-unit coal-fired generating plant located near Craig in northwestern Colorado and operated by Tri-State Generation and Transmission Association. The facility has a combined nameplate capacity of 1,427.6 MW, consisting of Unit 1 (446.4 MW), Unit 2 (446.4 MW), and Unit 3 (534.8 MW). While Unit 1 was scheduled to cease operations on Dec. 31, 2025, Units 2 and 3 were slated for retirement in 2028.

Unit 1’s planned retirement stems from a September 2016 agreement among the Craig Station owners—Tri-State Generation and Transmission Association, PacifiCorp, Platte River Power Authority, Salt River Project, and Public Service Company of Colorado—with the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and environmental groups to revise Colorado’s regional haze State Implementation Plan (SIP). The agreement followed a 2014 SIP that required significant reductions in nitrogen oxides at Unit 1 by August 2021. After reviewing compliance options—including installing additional emissions controls and switching fuels—the unit’s owners opted to seek an extension and commit to unit retirement, citing regulatory conditions, market outlooks, and the substantial cost of further emissions controls.

But, in its Dec. 30 order, the DOE said it relied in part on findings from the North American Electric Reliability Corp.’s (NERC’s) 2024 Long-Term Reliability Assessment, which identified growing reliability risks in the Western Electricity Coordinating Council’s (WECC’s) Northwest assessment area—covering Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Oregon, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming—amid accelerating baseload retirements. The DOE cited NERC’s projections that 5 GW “of baseload resource retirements are anticipated between 2024 and 2028.” It also pointed to the 2024 WECC Western Assessment of Resource Adequacy that found that peak demand in WECC’s Northwest-Central subregion (which includes Colorado) is “forecast to grow by 8.5% over the next decade, from 33 GW in 2025 to 36 GW in 2034.” WECC, the DOE noted, found most planned retirements involve “baseload generation, such as coal, natural gas, and nuclear.”

The DOE also cited the pace of generation retirements in Colorado, noting that since 2019, 571.3 MW of coal-fired capacity across six units at three sites have retired, reducing coal’s share of in-state generation from 45% to 28%. Looking ahead, the department pointed to Energy Information Administration projections showing that by 2029, about 3,700 MW of coal-fired generating capacity in Colorado is scheduled to retire—accounting for all but one coal-fired power plant in the state—alongside the retirement of 675.6 MW of natural gas-fired generating capacity. In contrast, intermittent wind resources accounted for more than 5,300 MW of Colorado’s electricity-generating capacity in 2025.

Ultimately, the DOE said it determined that “an emergency exists within the WECC Northwest assessment area due to a shortage of electric energy, a shortage of facilities for the generation of electric energy, and other causes.” It concluded that continued operation of Craig Unit 1 “will best meet the emergency and serve the public interest.” The agency also warned that if retired, a coal unit like Craig Unit 1 would be difficult to restart, and it said that “any stop and start of operation creates heating and cooling cycles that could cause an immediate failure that could take 30–60 days to repair,” with workforce, contract, and permitting constraints further extending restoration timelines.

Under the order, Tri-State and the unit’s co-owners will need to take all measures necessary to ensure Craig Unit 1 remains available to operate at the direction of either the Western Area Power Administration’s Rocky Mountain Region (Western Area Colorado–Missouri) in its role as balancing authority or Southwest Power Pool West in its role as reliability coordinator, as applicable, with sufficient time for orderly ramp-down following the order’s conclusion consistent with industry practices.

The DOE order, notably, halts a retirement that appeared central to Tri-State’s broader clean energy transition strategy. In August 2025, the Colorado Public Utilities Commission approved Tri-State’s 2023 Electric Resource Plan, which included Craig Unit 1’s scheduled retirement as part of a portfolio shift toward natural gas, renewables, and battery storage. Tri-State, which has been pursuing expanded participation in organized wholesale markets, also received Colorado PUC approval in December 2025 for its application to join Southwest Power Pool’s Western Energy Imbalance Service market—while simultaneously managing member exits and securing replacement capacity.

It is unclear if the forced extension of Craig Unit 1 through March 2026 disrupts that timeline and creates uncertainty for Tri-State and its member cooperatives, particularly given the DOE’s (now defunct) Grid Deployment Office terminated Tri-State’s $26.8 million Grid Resilience and Innovation Partnerships (GRIP) Program award earlier this year, eliminating federal support for grid modernization projects that were intended to support the utility’s transition away from coal.

DOE Extends MISO Coal Units to Address Year-Round Reliability Gaps

On December 23, meanwhile, the DOE issued two separate emergency orders requiring Northern Indiana Public Service Company (NIPSCO) and CenterPoint Energy to maintain five coal-fired units online through March 23, 2026. The directives affect NIPSCO’s Schahfer Generating Station Units 17 and 18—which are each rated at 423.5 MW and slated for retirement at year-end—and CenterPoint Energy’s F.B. Culley Generating Station Unit 2 (103.7 MW), also scheduled to retire in December 2025.

The R.M. Schahfer Generating Station, located in Wheatfield, Indiana, is owned and operated by Northern Indiana Public Service Company (NIPSCO), a division of NiSource Inc. The plant consists of four units: two natural gas–fired units (129 MW each) and two coal-fired units—Units 17 and 18—each rated at 423.5 MW, for a combined coal capacity of 847 MW. Units 17 and 18 entered service in 1983 and 1986, respectively, and were approved for retirement by MISO following NIPSCO’s Attachment Y Suspension Notice, with coal combustion scheduled to cease by Dec. 31, 2025 absent a directive to remain open. In October 2025, NIPSCO formally notified Indiana regulators that the units were on track for permanent retirement under federal effluent limitation guidelines, but confirmed that cessation of coal combustion—and associated environmental compliance milestones—would depend on the absence of a reliability-driven order compelling continued operation.

The F.B. Culley Generating Station, located in Warrick County, Indiana, is owned and operated by CenterPoint Energy. The coal-fired facility consists of Unit 2 (103.7 MW) and Unit 3 (265.2 MW), for a combined nameplate capacity of 368.9 MW. Unit 2 entered service in 1966 and Unit 3 in 1973, with Unit 2 scheduled to retire in December 2025 under CenterPoint’s long-term generation transition strategy. In its 2023 Integrated Resource Plan, filed with the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission, CenterPoint outlined a plan to end coal-fired generation in Indiana by 2027 and replace Culley’s coal output with a mix of renewable resources and natural gas-fired generation to meet new, more stringent MISO capacity requirements across all four seasons. The plan identified conversion of Unit 3—the last remaining coal unit—to natural gas by 2027 to preserve roughly 270 MW of dispatchable capacity, while allowing Unit 2 to retire as planned.

In both orders—like its previous emergency orders—the DOE found that if retired, coal units would be difficult to restart, warning that “any stop and start of operation creates heating and cooling cycles that could cause an immediate failure that could take 30–60 days to repair,” with workforce availability, contract constraints, permitting requirements, and potential disassembly further extending restoration timelines. The agency therefore directed that the affected units remain available to operate through March 23, 2026, with dispatch coordinated by MISO to minimize costs to ratepayers.

Echoing its other orders, the DOE determined that “an emergency exists in portions of the Midwest region of the United States due to a shortage of electric energy, a shortage of facilities for the generation of electricity, and other causes.” It concluded that continued operation of the units “will meet the emergency and serve the public interest.”

In justifying the Midwest extensions, the DOE leaned heavily on reliability assessments from MISO and the NERC, citing evidence that resource adequacy risks in MISO have shifted from a seasonal issue to a year-round concern. The agency specifically pointed to MISO findings showing that “reliability risks associated with resource adequacy have shifted from ‘summer only’ to a year-round concern,” with more than 60% of MISO’s MaxGen emergency events—triggered when available generation is insufficient—occurring outside the traditional summer peak season. However, the DOE also cited MISO documentation attributing the shift to accelerating retirements of dispatchable generation, declining reserve margins, increased reliance on weather-dependent resources, and more frequent extreme weather.

Backlash Is Mounting

The orders come on the heels of the DOE’s December 16 emergency order directing TransAlta to ensure Unit 2 of the Centralia Generating Station in Centralia, Washington, remains available through March 16, 2026. The 730-MW coal unit, Washington’s last coal-fired power plant, was scheduled to shut down on December 31 under SB 5769, a state law that mandated closure by year-end.

So far, the Trump administration has issued more emergency orders in 2025 than in any prior comparable period over the past two decades, according to Congressional Research Service (CRS) analysis. The DOE’s emergency authority under Section 202(c) of the Federal Power Act is typically a rarely used provision that grants the Secretary of Energy broad discretion to temporarily override normal electricity market, regulatory, and environmental constraints during declared emergencies. According to the CRS, Section 202(c) allows DOE to “require by order such temporary connections of facilities and such generation, delivery, interchange, or transmission of electric energy as in its judgment will best meet the emergency and serve the public interest” when it determines that an emergency exists due to shortages of electric energy, generation facilities, fuel, or other causes. While the authority was originally designed to address short-term disruptions—such as extreme weather events, transmission outages, or sudden demand spikes—CRS notes that its use to delay long-planned power plant retirements represents a broader and increasingly contested interpretation of the statute.

The expanding wave of Section 202(c) orders, meanwhile, has already triggered swift and fierce opposition. Earlier this month, Washington Governor Bob Ferguson, Attorney General Nick Brown, and Ecology Director Casey Sixkiller jointly condemned the Centralia order, saying: “Under the guise of ’emergency powers,’ U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright is attempting to force Washington state’s dirtiest power plant to continue burning coal. Let’s be clear: there’s no emergency here.”

Similar resistance has followed the December 23 Indiana orders affecting coal units at Schahfer and Culley, with potentially far-reaching repercussions. Last week, the Sierra Club and Earthjustice filed the first-ever judicial challenge to DOE’s use of Section 202(c), asserting that the orders unlawfully override decisions made by utilities, state regulators, and grid operators. Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel filed a Request for Rehearing challenging DOE’s repeated extensions for the J.H. Campbell plant, arguing that the orders exceed DOE’s authority under the Federal Power Act and fail to satisfy statutory limits requiring operation only when necessary. “Nearly seven months into this fabricated emergency, what is now clear is that DOE will continue issuing these unlawful orders unless the courts intervene,” she wrote.

Cost and reliability concerns are also adding complexity. Earthjustice characterized the Indiana orders as “an unprecedented power grab” that overrides decisions made by power companies, grid operators, and state utility regulators, noting that the targeted coal plants were already deemed uneconomic and unreliable. The group has cited filings showing that compliance with earlier DOE orders at J.H. Campbell cost more than $80 million over several months—an average of more than $615,000 per day.

The group has also pointed to an independent Grid Strategies analysis—which the consulting group prepared for Earthjustice, the Environmental Defense Fund, NRDC, and the Sierra Club—that estimates federal mandates forcing large fossil plants scheduled to retire through 2028 to remain online could cost ratepayers between $3.1 billion and $5.9 billion per year, depending on how many units are subject to emergency orders. The August 2025 study assumes an average subsidy of $89,315 per MW-year, based on recent Reliability Must Run contracts used by regional grid operators, and suggests the estimate may be conservative. It notes that early cost data from federally mandated plant extensions already exceed $180,000 per MW-year in some cases",https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/jh-campbell-complex-waterway-descriptor3.png,N,,2025-12-31 18:13:13.878078

‘It was the best of times, and it was the worst of times’,” said Abigail Ross Harper with the Solar Energy Industries Association, describing solar energy’s 2025.
Solar companies now have a lot less time to qualify for federal tax credits.
And, she said, some solar projects have had trouble getting federal permits.
“And that gives extra reason for developers to try to build their solar projects now,” said Daniel Cohan, a professor of environmental engineering at Rice University.","Dec. 31 was the last day to qualify for a federal tax credit for installation of rooftop solar panels. That’s just one of the policy changes in Washington that clouded the outlook for the solar industry this year. Other tax credits for large, commercial solar installations are still available, but they’ll end years earlier than originally planned — per President Donald Trump's tax and spending bill passed in July.

And yet, according to the energy analytics firm Wood Mackenzie, solar made up 58% of all new energy generation through the first nine months of this year.

”I will borrow a phrase from a renowned author. ‘It was the best of times, and it was the worst of times’,” said Abigail Ross Harper with the Solar Energy Industries Association, describing solar energy’s 2025.

Solar companies now have a lot less time to qualify for federal tax credits. And, she said, some solar projects have had trouble getting federal permits.

“There have been delays and stoppages and just outright, like lack of response from federal agencies,” Ross Harper said.

And yet, we just keep building more solar. Partly, because those tax credits are going away.

“And that gives extra reason for developers to try to build their solar projects now,” said Daniel Cohan, a professor of environmental engineering at Rice University.

Solar is also growing because energy demand is rising fast. From new data centers, manufacturing plants, and electric vehicles.

“The only source of new power that can grow very quickly and scale up is solar. Every other source of energy has key barriers that keeps it from growing in the near term,” Cohan said.

New coal plants aren’t really a thing. The Trump administration has shut down several major offshore wind power projects. Nuclear power will take five to ten years to build, Cohan said. And new natural gas turbines are backlogged.

“There's only so much new natural gas power capacity that can be added anytime soon. That leaves solar as the biggest option and really, the only one that can be scaled up in the next few years,” he said.

It’s also gotten cheap. So have battery storage systems, said Rob Gramlich, head of the consulting firm Grid Strategies. Put solar panels and batteries together, and you can power the grid even when the sun isn’t shining.

“You can run most of the grid on solar through the afternoon and then into the evening, when you're still running air conditioning in the hot summers, then you have the batteries that were charged in the afternoon delivering power through the evening,” Gramlich said.

It’s been a really good year for that combo.

Paul MoseleyNorfolk political reporter

Plans for a large solar farm received a significant setback - while another reached a major milestone.

Developers of the 3,600-acre (1,460-hectare) Tasway Energy Park project near Long Stratton, Norfolk, said they had not been given a date to connect to the national grid system, meaning they were now ""reviewing the next steps"".

The Stop Tasway Solar campaign group, which has opposed the project over concerns of ""industrialisation of the countryside"", said it hoped it would now be withdrawn altogether.

However, the firm behind the nearby East Pye Solar scheme – which would cover almost 2,700 acres (1,090 hectares) – said it had been told it would get a connection to the national grid.

With its flat terrain and generally sunnier weather, Norfolk has been seen as an ideal place for solar farms – and several of the UK's largest have been proposed for the county.

The government has said such schemes are necessary to reduce energy bills, cut carbon emissions and provide better energy security.

But critics have warned about the loss of agricultural land and the impact on the look of the countryside.

And the largest solar farms have been controversial because, due to their classification as nationally significant infrastructure, final say on them rests with the government instead of local councils.

Earlier this month, the government-owned National Energy System Operator (NESO) told developers whether they would receive connections to the national grid.

Those deemed ""ready to go"" received ""Gate 2"" status, giving them a connection date to join the national power network.

Others were given ""Gate 1"", meaning they have no date for connection, but could move forward in the future.

Developer Island Green Power (IGP) said its East Pye project - stretched over a large area across villages including Hempnall, Great Moulton and Saxlingham Nethergate - had received ""Gate 2"" status.

IGP has said the site, which would cover 1,500 football pitches, would generate power for 115,000 homes a year.

Whilst the firm said it expected to formally seek approval from the government for its plans in February, campaign group Block East Pye Solar told the BBC it was ""taking legal advice"" on whether it could challenge the decision.

IGP also received positive news about its Droves solar and battery storage scheme, which would cover another 2,800 acres near the East Pye site.

Project manager Harman Sond said the government's planning inspectorate had agreed to inspect its proposals – which he described as ""a significant milestone"".

However, the firm did not confirm if it had been given a date for connecting to the grid.

The future of the Tasway project, though, which would also be built in south Norfolk, has been thrown into doubt.

It received ""Gate 1"" status and its developers, energy firm Aukera, said it was ""reviewing next steps"".

""This outcome will mean there will be a delay to the planning submission process,"" the company added.

Myles Jeeves, from Stop Tasway Solar, was pleased - but wanted to see the proposals completely scrapped.

""We think this is the right decision, given the existing projects in the area,"" he said.

""We hope Tasway will do the right thing and withdraw the scheme rather than hang it over all our heads.""

But the developers of the 4,000-acre (1,619-hectare) High Grove project, planned for five sites near Swaffham and Dereham in Norfolk, would not disclose what kind of connection they had been offered by NESO.

A spokeswoman for RWE said it was reviewing decisions made and ""considering the implications for our current and future projects"".

""Once this process has been completed we will be able to provide further details regarding the High Grove project,"" she added.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/e8e3/live/d53cf6b0-b02b-11f0-a375-75de819286d1.jpg,N,,2025-12-31 22:57:17.169743

(NASDAQ: TSLA) that can only be described as a high-stakes rollercoaster. It was a year where the laws of financial gravity seemed to bend; while the company’s core automotive business faced its first prolonged annual contraction in history, its market valuation surged to record heights. This ""decoupling"" of stock price from vehicle deliveries has redefined Tesla not as a car company, but as a speculative barometer for the future of Artificial Intelligence and robotics.

The immediate implications of 2025 are profound. Tesla has successfully transitioned its narrative away from being the ""king of EVs""—a title it officially ceded to Chinese rival BYD (OTC:BYDDY) this year—and toward becoming an AI powerhouse. However, this pivot has come at a cost. The company’s heavy reliance on the personal brand of Elon Musk and the speculative promise of ""unsupervised"" autonomy has introduced a level of volatility that now poses a systemic risk to the broader Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQ: IXIC).

The Year of the ""Demand Cliff"" and the Robotaxi Pivot

The 2025 timeline for Tesla was marked by extreme highs and sobering lows. The year began in a ""stagnation phase,"" with the company struggling to maintain the breakneck growth of previous years. By the end of the fourth quarter, the ""demand cliff"" became a reality: annual deliveries were estimated at 1.64 million units, an 8.3% decline from 2024. This contraction was punctuated by a record-breaking Q3, where customers rushed to purchase vehicles before the expiration of federal tax credits, only to see interest plummet in the final months of the year.

The centerpiece of the year was the long-awaited Robotaxi launch on June 22, 2025, in Austin, Texas. While the event initially sent the stock soaring, the reality was more nuanced. Tesla was forced to include safety drivers in its pilot fleet, failing to achieve the ""Level 5"" unsupervised autonomy that Musk had promised for the year. This led to an official postponement of the ""unsupervised"" rollout to 2026, yet the market largely looked past the delay, choosing instead to price in the massive potential of the ""AI Moat"" that Tesla is building through its Full Self-Driving (FSD) data.

Key players this year extended beyond the boardroom. Elon Musk’s dual role as Tesla CEO and a lead figure in the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) under the Trump administration created a unique ""partisan effect."" On November 6, 2025, shareholders approved a revised $1 trillion compensation package for Musk, a move that signaled total alignment with his vision, despite vocal concerns from institutional investors about his distractions with X (formerly Twitter) and political ventures.

Winners and Losers in the Great EV Shift

The clear winner of the 2025 fiscal year was Tesla Energy. While the car business stalled, the energy segment became the ""quiet giant,"" deploying a record 12.5 GWh of energy storage in Q3 alone—an 81% year-over-year increase. With gross margins exceeding 30%, Tesla Energy now contributes nearly 25% of the company’s total profit, providing a critical safety net for the balance sheet as automotive margins were squeezed to 17% by persistent price wars.

On the losing side, Tesla’s dominance in the global EV market has officially been broken. BYD (OTC:BYDDY) finished 2025 as the world’s top seller of electric vehicles, leveraging its vertical integration to undercut Tesla’s pricing by as much as 50% in European and Southeast Asian markets. Meanwhile, legacy automakers like Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F) and Hyundai Motor Company (KRX:005380) have successfully chipped away at Tesla’s U.S. market share, which fell below 50% for the first time this year.

The consumer base also saw a significant shift. Data from the latter half of 2025 suggests a ""Musk Partisan Effect,"" where Tesla lost an estimated 1 million potential sales in the U.S. due to Musk’s political polarization. While favorability rose among Republican buyers, it collapsed among Democrats—the demographic that historically formed the core of the early EV adopter market.

Broader Industry Trends and the AI Narrative

Tesla’s performance in 2025 is a microcosm of a broader trend: the ""AI-fication"" of the industrial sector. The market is no longer valuing Tesla based on how many Model 3s it can produce, but on its potential to dominate the humanoid robotics market with Optimus and the software-as-a-service (SaaS) potential of FSD. This shift has turned Tesla into a ""speculative barometer"" for the entire tech sector. When Tesla hit its all-time intraday high of $498.83 in mid-December, it single-handedly powered the Nasdaq to new peaks.

However, this reliance on a single company’s AI narrative has regulatory and policy implications. The delay of unsupervised Robotaxis highlights the gap between Silicon Valley’s ""move fast and break things"" ethos and the stringent safety requirements of federal transportation regulators. Furthermore, Tesla’s aggressive pricing strategies to combat BYD have triggered a ""race to the bottom"" in EV margins, forcing competitors to either innovate rapidly or exit the low-end EV market entirely.

Historically, this year draws comparisons to the dot-com era, where valuations were built on future promises rather than current cash flows. The difference in 2025 is Tesla’s massive infrastructure—its Gigafactories and energy business—which provide a tangible foundation that many 1990s tech darlings lacked. Yet, the volatility remains, as seen during the late-December correction where Tesla paced Nasdaq decliners, dragging the entire index down as the AI-driven trade cooled.

What Lies Ahead for 2026

Looking toward 2026, Tesla faces a critical strategic pivot. The company must prove that it can move from ""supervised"" to ""unsupervised"" autonomy to justify its $1.5 trillion market cap. Any further delays in the Robotaxi rollout or FSD regulatory hurdles could lead to a massive re-rating of the stock. Investors are also closely watching for the rumored ""Model 2""—a more affordable entry-level vehicle—which many analysts believe is the only way for Tesla to regain lost ground from BYD in the mass market.

The integration of Optimus into Tesla’s own factory lines will be another key milestone. If Tesla can demonstrate that its humanoid robots can significantly reduce manufacturing costs, it may solve its margin problem without needing to raise vehicle prices. However, the challenge of maintaining a cohesive brand image amidst Elon Musk’s increasingly public political role will continue to be a wild card that could either open new doors in government contracting or continue to alienate a large segment of the traditional consumer base.

A Year of Transformation and Tension

In summary, 2025 was the year Tesla ceased to be a car company and became a high-stakes bet on the future of autonomy. The key takeaways for the year are clear: the energy business is a powerhouse, the automotive business is under siege from China, and the stock price is now untethered from traditional delivery metrics, driven instead by AI sentiment and the personal influence of Elon Musk.

Moving forward, the market is likely to remain volatile. Tesla’s outsized weight in the Nasdaq means that its idiosyncratic risks—from a Musk tweet to a regulatory setback in FSD—are now systemic risks for all tech investors. In the coming months, investors should keep a close eye on FSD version 13 adoption rates and the progress of the Austin Robotaxi pilot. Tesla has survived the rollercoaster of 2025, but the tracks ahead in 2026 look equally steep and unpredictable.

The Guardian notes South Korea has the world’s seventh-largest coal power fleet and is the fourth-largest thermal coal importer behind China, India and Japan.
Japan, whose economy is more than twice the size of South Korea, uses double the amount of renewable energy.
South Korea currently relies on coal for 30% of its energy needs, but within 14 years it could be zero.
We know that we're hearing the same thing from China, that many coal power plants will be shut down over the next five to 10 years.","South Korea’s move to kill coal will almost certainly have repercussions on two of its largest energy customers, Australia and the United States.

A decision on the polluting fossil fuel was made at the COP30 climate conference in Brazil, when South Korea’s Ministry of Climate, Energy and Environment announced plans to retire most of the country’s coal-fired power plants by 2040, and to at least halve its carbon emissions by 2035. Forty of the plants already have confirmed closure dates.

South Korea has been criticized for not acting faster to address the climate, according to the Guardian.

A new policy direction came with the election of a more liberal president in June, Lee Jae Myung, who campaigned for stronger climate commitments than his conservative predecessor, Yoon Suk Yeol.

The country is a major importer of coal and natural gas and lags its counterparts in the adoption of renewable energies.

The Guardian notes South Korea has the world’s seventh-largest coal power fleet and is the fourth-largest thermal coal importer behind China, India and Japan. Coal provides about 30% of its electricity.

Related: Where are The World's Rare Earth Minerals Located?

It is also a significant importer of metallurgical coal, used in steelmaking, and has substantial nuclear and gas-power fleets, each supplying roughly one-third of its electricity.

By contrast, renewable energy generated just 10.5% of South Korea’s domestic power last year. Japan, whose economy is more than twice the size of South Korea, uses double the amount of renewable energy.

There are plans to boost offshore wind power capacity to 4 gigawatts, around 10 times the current level.

Climate activists are rejoicing South Korea’s move away from fossil fuels, but the policy places the country in a quandary with the United States.

That’s because, as part of a trade deal with the Trump administration that would see it avoid higher tariffs, South Korea agreed to raise imports of US liquefied natural gas.

The Associated Press reports Talks are underway for South Korea to invest $350 billion in U.S. projects and purchase up to $100 billion worth of U.S. energy products, including LNG, a natural gas cooled to liquid form for easy storage and travel. It burns cleaner than coal, but still causes planet-warming emissions, especially of methane.

It’s important to note that the agreement with the US is still under negotiation. AP says depending on the deal’s duration, the country may import between 3 and 9 million tons of US LNG a year.

The quandary is that South Korea is making deals with the United States to import more LNG at the same time as setting a target to cut its LNG import percentage from almost a fifth last year to 10.6% by 2038.

Insung Lee with Greenpeace in Seoul is skeptical:

“If we just replace coal plants with LNG, that means the coal exit actually doesn’t lead to a green transition and merely shifts Korea’s addiction from coal to gas, which undermines the whole spirit of climate action,"" AP quoted Lee saying.

The decision to close coal plants, meanwhile, is sounding the alarm in Australia, the world’s second-largest coal exporter behind Indonesia, and the planet’s biggest exporter of met coal by far.

Australia expects to export $1.5 billion worth of thermal coal to South Korea in 2025, and is hoping for the same figure in 2026, according to analytics firm Kepler.

South Korea currently relies on coal for 30% of its energy needs, but within 14 years it could be zero.

At COP30, South Korea announced it would join the Powering Past Coal Alliance, a group of around 60 countries and 120 sub-national governments, businesses and organizations that are phasing out the use of fossil fuels. China hasn’t officially joined, but it plans on doing so.

But is there another explanation for South Korea’s plan to quit coal? Sources say it comes down to economics.

In most current scenarios, coal is significantly more expensive to run than building new renewable energy sources like wind and solar.

Studies show 99% of US coal plants are more costly to operate than replacing them with new clean energy, a trend accelerated by factors like the Inflation Reduction Act. Renewables, even with storage, offer lower Levelized Costs of Energy (LCOE) compared to coal, making coal economically uncompetitive for power generation. (AI Overview)

Kim Sung-hwan, South Korea's Minister of Climate, Energy and Environment, said shifting from coal to renewables will increase the country’s energy security, by not relying as much on foreign imports; and it will boost the competitiveness of South Korean businesses.

How so? By making energy cheaper. In response, James Bowen, the director of consultancy ReMap Research, said that Australian coal exports could fall in value by 50% over the next five years.

“South Korea’s decision should prompt Australia to show leadership by discussing timeframes for its own fossil fuel phaseout while helping its regional neighbours to embrace clean energy,” he said via the Guardian.

Video blogger Sam Evans, aka ‘The Electric Viking’, notes that Australia too is reducing domestic coal usage. He said the government recently introduced ambitious domestic green energy plans, with the aim of increasing the proportion of electricity from renewable energy from 42% over the past year to 82% by the end of the decade.

“South Korea’s ambitious goal… shows that demand for coal is going to continue falling. We know that we're hearing the same thing from China, that many coal power plants will be shut down over the next five to 10 years.

“It's going to be a tsunami for coal. There's going to be coal companies going bankrupt all over the world. So, if you want to short anything, this is what you should be shorting,” he concluded.

Previously, I’ve written about the potential for a future smart grid, where homes with solar panels and batteries intelligently interconnect to form a cleaner, more-robust distributed power system. While we’re still far from a full-fledged smart grid, recent years have seen wider deployment of distributed energy storage. Today, Germany already boasts over 7,000 home solar plus energy storage systems, and some analysts suggest the U.S. could see similar growth once Tesla’s much-touted battery “Gigafactory” starts producing at scale.

With home battery systems on the rise, it’s worth thinking about how economics might influence the development of storage-equipped smart grids in the future. Consider the example of solar energy tariffs in Germany versus the United States.

In Germany, solar energy delivered to the grid is paid a set “feed-in tariff,” a fixed energy rate established by the government to promote adoption of solar energy. Today, the tariff ranges from about 13 to 14 euro cents per kilowatt-hour of energy—far less than Germany’s typical residential electricity rates of about 22 to 29 euro cents per kilowatt-hour.

The difference between these two rates creates an incentive to store solar energy before it can flow to the grid. If solar electricity is stored and then used in the home, it offsets purchase of grid electricity at the cost of not collecting the solar feed-in tariff. The current difference between these rates equates to a net benefit of 10-15 euro cents per kilowatt-hour of solar energy diverted from the grid into batteries.

In the United States it’s a different story. Solar power generated by electricity customers is typically either “net metered” or paid a “value-of-solar” tariff. Under a net metering rate, produced solar energy essentially rolls the electric meter backwards, i.e. it is valued at exactly the price of retail electricity. Value-of-solar tariffs pay for solar at a rate calculated based on its overall environmental and system benefits. Rates calculated by Minnesota’s Public Utility Commission (14.5 cents per kilowatt-hour) and Austin’s municipal electric utility (12.8 cents per kilowatt-hour) both exceed retail energy rates. Under both of these solar tariffs, the economic decision is to send solar electricity directly into the grid, rather than save it for later use in the home.

Instead of storing solar energy, U.S. home battery systems are intended to take advantage of time-of-use electricity rates, which charge more for energy use during peak hours. The battery stores extra grid electricity at night, when electricity is cheapest, to offset the purchase of expensive on-peak electricity.

The effect of storage operating under the U.S. rates is that a home uses more grid electricity at night, uses less on-peak electricity, and stores no solar energy for use in the home. Anytime solar power production exceeds the home’s energy demand, the extra power is simply pumped back into the grid, turning the home into a net generator.

The difference between Germany’s energy-independence rate structure and the U.S. grid-centric structure is subtle yet in many ways decisive. Germany’s utility tariffs incentivize a home to minimize its interaction with the wider grid, encouraging a system where individual homes can more-easily operate independently. The U.S. rates incentivize more economic reliance on the grid both to store cheap nighttime energy and sell extra solar energy.

The distinction between these rates illustrates divergent visions for the future smart grid: one that prefers energy independence versus one that prefers reliance on the central grid. Which is preferable? The short answer is: it depends. It will certainly be interesting to see how smart grids develop over the coming years.",https://www.scientificamerican.com/static/sciam-mark.jpg,N,,2025-12-31 20:58:27.434558

The New York banking giant is working with real estate advisory Newmark Group Inc. to raise both equity and credit for the project building modular natural gas-fired generation serving a cluster of south Dallas data centers, according to developer GridFree AI. Newmark has also been tapped as the exclusive marketer and advisor for the data hub, called South Dallas One.

The aim in this initial round is to raise “hundreds of millions of dollars” with more rounds as the first project is scaled up, according to Philip Krim, chief executive officer of Montauk Capital, which incubated GridFree AI.

Goldman declined to comment.

The US power system, which is based on Thomas Edison’s 19th century grid, is struggling to meet the electricity needs of the modern economy. Aging infrastructure is being strained by extreme weather and unprecedented demand growth. Consumers are faced with a double whammy of rising power bills and a greater threat of blackouts in large parts of the US.

“Edison’s grid was not built for the scale and size of these data centers,” said Krim. “We ended up saying, ‘Let’s start a company for energy experts to build a data center — knowing how energy-dense and energy—hungry data centers are — to scale up the AI buildout.'”

GridFree AI was formed about a year ago with Ralph Alexander as CEO. Alexander, a nuclear engineer, previously served as the top executive at Talen Energy Corp., where he led the development of a data center campus next to the independent power producer’s Susquehanna nuclear plant in Pennsylvania. Amazon Web Services bought that campus early last year, which was expanded this year into a 1.92 gigawatt supply contract with Talen. This co-location deal quickly became the major flash point in making sure tech giants pay for their fair share of power plants and grid infrastructure without shifting those costs to other consumers.

“South Dallas One represents the future of AI-ready infrastructure: fast to deploy, resilient by design, and insulated from the grid constraints holding back the industry,” Alexander said in an statement.

With land for two of the three sites secured, GridFree said initial power can be brought online in less than 24 months from the lease being signed, significantly faster than waiting to connect to the Texas grid. Each site will have about 1.5 gigawatts of power with structures to house data centers. The plan is to build 100-megawatt modules — 10 gas turbines providing around-the-clock power and two for back-up — so they can be quickly plugged into projects, Krim said.

This set—up can be done on 500 acres and will use the one household’s worth of water because waste heat from power generation will be captured to help with cooling needs, he said.

While these AI campuses will be self-reliant, the goal is to ultimately connect to the Texas grid to supply spare power, Krim said. Fuel for the gas plants will be supplied by two pipelines, including one owned by Energy Transfer LP, and no back-up diesel generators will be needed, Krim said.

Water cooling systems help lower carbon emissions by reducing reliance on fossil fuel power plants for energy-intensive air cooling.","In our increasingly digital world, data centers are the unseen backbone of the internet.

Behind every search query, video stream, or artificial intelligence request is a cooling system that raises a critical question: Why do data centers need water?

Data centers house thousands of servers that generate a tremendous amount of heat. Without cooling, these machines would overheat and fail.

That’s where water comes in. Many data centers use evaporative cooling or closed-loop cooling systems to keep temperatures stable.

Water is often more efficient than air cooling because it transfers heat more effectively. This helps reduce energy consumption and improves energy efficiency.

Cold water or liquid coolant is circulated through heat exchangers to absorb hot air from server racks, which is then cooled again for reuse.

Most data centers use water in some form, especially large data centers operated by major tech companies like Google.

In 2023, Google reported consuming over 6 billion gallons (22.7 billion liters) of water to cool all its data centers. Water consumption is used as part of a strategy to balance energy usage and environmental impact.

The amount varies by region and cooling method. Some facilities use over 1 million gallons (3.8 million liters) per day.

In 2020, U.S. data centers collectively used an estimated 174 billion gallons (659 billion liters) of water, mostly for cooling. That’s enough to fill over 260,000 Olympic-sized swimming pools.

The United States leads the world in data center deployment. As of early 2024, there were more than 5,300 data centers in the U.S., spread across nearly every state.

Virginia, Texas, and California have the highest concentrations, largely due to connectivity, power access, and favorable climate conditions.

Many new data center projects are planned in water stressed regions, increasing the urgency for better water management practices.

From the outside, data centers resemble giant industrial warehouses. They’re often windowless and can span hundreds of thousands of square feet. Inside, rows of server racks line climate-controlled rooms, with hot air containment systems, cooling towers, and backup generators.

The facilities also feature massive power and water infrastructure, including tanks, heat exchangers, and pipes that circulate water or liquid coolant.

In some locations, these buildings blend into suburban business parks, while others are in remote areas optimized for energy efficiency and water conservation.

Water cooling systems help lower carbon emissions by reducing reliance on fossil fuel power plants for energy-intensive air cooling.

But that benefit comes with tradeoffs. Cooling towers evaporate water during the process, meaning data centers rank among the top 10 water-consuming industries in the U.S.

To reduce impact, some companies are using recycled water, reclaimed water, or non-potable water to meet their cooling needs. Others are investing in immersion cooling and water usage effectiveness metrics to improve water management.",https://media.hswstatic.com/eyJidWNrZXQiOiJjb250ZW50Lmhzd3N0YXRpYy5jb20iLCJrZXkiOiJnaWZcL3NodXR0ZXJzdG9jay0xMzk0MDM1MTY5LmpwZyIsImVkaXRzIjp7InJlc2l6ZSI6eyJ3aWR0aCI6IjEyMDAifX19,N,,2025-12-31 18:13:17.458839

The demand drivers remain clear: Data centers from tech giants like Google and QTS, combined with expanding industrial and agricultural operations, are pushing Iowa’s energy consumption to levels not seen since the 1960s. Projections call for a 30% to 60% increase in electrical load by 2030.

Iowa’s response has been multifaceted. The state leads the nation in renewable energy generation, with wind providing 63% of electricity production. Solar installations saw explosive growth — 554 megawatts added in 2024 alone, representing $706 million in investment. MidAmerican Energy received approval for 800 megawatts of solar generation, the largest in state history, while Alliant Energy announced plans for up to 1,000 megawatts of additional wind capacity.

However, uncertainty arrived when the One Big Beautiful Bill eliminated residential solar tax credits effective Dec. 31, 2025. Solar installers predicted residential installations could plummet by 90% and industry employment could be cut in half. Nearly half of Iowa counties have also enacted restrictive ordinances creating barriers to utility-scale renewable development.

Meanwhile, the push to restart the Duane Arnold Energy Center gained momentum as NextEra Energy Resources secured key regulatory approvals. The restart, potentially operational by first quarter 2029, would create 400 permanent jobs and generate more than $340 million in annual economic output.

Transcript

Part I

MEGHNA CHAKRABARTI: It's New Year's Eve in 1980 in Austin, Texas. A man wearing a hat decorated with an armadillo shell and deer antlers steps to the microphone at a music club.

Live from deep in the heart of Texas! Live from the Armadillo world headquarters! Commander Cody! (MUSIC)

COMMANDER CODY: (SINGING) Everyone who loved The Armadillo, I want you to give me a cheer. (CHEERING)

CHAKRABARTI: The Armadillo is in fact called the Armadillo World Headquarters in Austin. Sadly, it was the music venue's last night. The club was closing after roughly a decade in Austin. The band Commander Cody and His Lost Planet Airmen had the stage.

COMMANDER CODY: (SINGING) Nights like this, when my brain gets fried --

CHAKRABARTI: The Armadillo hosted hundreds of musical acts during its run. People like Willie Nelson, Jerry Jeff Walker, Frank Zappa, Waylon Jennings, and Charlie Daniels.

CHARLIE DANIELS: Armadillo’s a special place to play. There's no doubt about it. When they put that few inches of asphalt over the top of this place, they’ll be buryin’ something. It'll be a long time before anybody ever realizes what they buried. You know, it was a place to kinda start happening. Everybody respected it, you know. It is the end of an era. Ain't no two ways about it. It's an end of an era.

CHAKRABARTI: Charlie Daniels there. They put more than a couple of inches of asphalt over The Armadillo. Shortly after it closed, it was demolished and replaced with a multi-story office building.

Now for some in Austin, places like The Armadillo are a symbol of what they like to call ""Old Austin,"" because for decades the city has been known as a funky, liberal haven in a deep red state. A place where venues like The Armadillo could thrive.

But now tech money is pouring into the city and there's been huge growth. Elon Musk has moved both his Tesla and X headquarters to the Austin area. Big names like Joe Rogan also live there now. Here's Rogan talking about why he loves Austin on his podcast with comedian Kevin James last year.

KEVIN JAMES: By the way, I love Austin. I'm coming here. I want to be here every day.

JOE ROGAN: Move here! Club's always very available. You'll have fun, great place to work out. Come here to my gym. We can work out together. The way they treat, like, freedom here is like a religion. Freedom is a different thing in Texas. They, they're not interested in controlling your — what you buy and where you go and what you do on your land.

JAMES: Love it.

ROGAN: You can own a zebra. They don't give a [EXPLETIVE].

CHAKRABARTI: Now listeners who hear On Point in Austin on station KUT, they, too, have noticed a shift in the city's culture.

ASHLEY: I don’t smell as much patchouli in Austin as I used to. When I first got to Austin it would be everywhere. Nowadays, I’m much more likely to smell a designer perfume or something along those lines.

RANDY: There was a warehouse district that was pretty close to downtown in the '80s and '90s, and there were all these punk clubs there. And so we would go see really great bands and pay $5. Now it's like gourmet chocolate and a $18 salad place. This is the new Austin.

JENEE: It really was about music and art and just this whole vibe of kind of anything goes. And you can do and look kind of however you want. And new Austin is all about shiny things.

CHAKRABARTI: Those are On Point listeners and Austinites Ashley, Randy, and Jenee. Now, of course, cities change. This is a fact. Technology changes things. Trends come and go. Demographics shift and gentrification happens. That's not what makes the old Austin/new Austin story so interesting, especially for those of us who don't live there.

What I find most fascinating is that Texas is the second most populous state in the union today. And that growth is attributed to the fact that Texas prides itself as being a low tax, low regulation, pro-growth state, but even that super welcoming environment has not been able to cope with the speed Texas' own capital is booming. So just to lovingly rile up both our Texas and California listeners for a second, I wonder: Does that make Austin the San Francisco of Texas?

Joshua Long joins us to help answer that question. He's at KUT in Austin. He is a professor of environmental studies at Southwestern University and author of the book Weird City: Sense of Place and Creative Resistance in Austin, Texas.

Professor Long, welcome.

JOSHUA LONG: Hello, Meghna. Good to be here.

CHAKRABARTI: Is Austin the San Francisco of Texas?

LONG: That was a great intro. I'm not really sure how to answer that question.

CHAKRABARTI: (LAUGHS) Who do you wanna offend the least? Let's just put it that way.

LONG: Exactly. It's yeah, that's definitely been on my mind when preparing for today's discussion.

CHAKRABARTI: Okay. I appreciate the elegance with which you sidestepped that question. So let me get to an easier one to answer. How long have you lived in Austin?

LONG: Oh, I currently don't live in Austin.

CHAKRABARTI: Oh, you don't?

LONG: I've lived in and around Austin for most of my life. But I'm currently in Georgetown, because I teach at Southwestern and I'm very close to the university where I teach. But in some ways, that sort of outside looking in is, I think, very true for a lot of Austinites, who have been displaced from Austin for various reasons, but still call themselves Austinites and still have that connection to the city.

CHAKRABARTI: Help me with my Texas geography, Georgetown being out where, relative to Austin?

LONG: Depending on traffic, anywhere between a half an hour to an hour and a half north of Austin.

CHAKRABARTI: Okay. Okay. Got it. But you said you've been living in and around Austin for most, if not all of your life?

LONG: Yeah, it was a circuitous route through graduate school and some jobs overseas. But honestly, I grew up in Bastrop, which might come up in the conversation later because we've seen Bastrop transform quite a bit over the last few years. But I went to school in Austin and worked at the Capitol, worked at Austin coffee shops. And over the years have seen the city transform quite a bit.

CHAKRABARTI: Okay, so before we talk about that actual transformation, I still want to know a little bit more about like, your relationship with Austin. Like how do you feel about this place?

LONG: Oh, these are the questions I was hoping to avoid. (LAUGHS)

CHAKRABARTI: (LAUGHS)

LONG: I still, I actually have a deep love for Austin and always will, but it is mixed feelings, and I think that's true for a lot of Austinites.

We still miss some of the old landscapes and honestly the vibe, that sort of laid back, slower living and a greater sense of tolerance and friendliness that Austin was very much known for. A lot of that is disappearing. But you still can find that in pockets throughout the city, and I enjoy it when I do stumble across that from time to time.

CHAKRABARTI: Yeah. The reason why I asked is because even though I've lived in New England for roughly half my life now, I still consider home the Pacific Northwest. And for some of the same reasons, especially Seattle — that's not my home territory, Oregon is — but that sort of corridor there on the other side of the country for some of the same reasons, has changed so rapidly.

This idea of what constitutes the soul of a city and especially ones that are so geographically unique, really is, it hits home for me. So to hear that you have this this internal tussle about it resonates quite deeply with me. But how long have people been lamenting the loss of old Austin?

LONG: That's a great question. Because it really depends on who you ask. For many people, it was the decade of the 'Dillo was true old Austin, that was the golden age of Austin. And I think they have a pretty good case in some ways there.

But it depends on, if somebody moved here in the '80s or '90s and they lived through certain transformations of the tech scene and the music scene, then they identify with certain music venues there, or restaurants that closed then, or when they started to have to pay to get into Barton Springs. So for everyone, it's a little bit different.

But if you were to look at this sort of taking a step back, I think there's been three waves I would argue of an Austin narrative that has emerged — in the '60s and '70s, in the '80s and '90s, and since 2000 — and they're all unique in their own way. And we've seen this move away from old Austin to new Austin and somewhere in the middle that you could probably draw a dividing line.

CHAKRABARTI: So '60s, '70s, '80s, and '90s. That's interesting. Could I interpret that as, in a sense, Austinites have always been lamenting the loss of old Austin? Just depends on when you moved there?

LONG: Yeah, we speak about it in nostalgic and sad tones. There's a joke that came out in a play a few years ago, like old Austinites talk about Austin like they're veterans of some war. ""You have no idea what it was like!""

But there was something special about the Austin that emerged in the 1970s, this sort of hippie libertarianism, that there's only a couple regions in the United States where that term gets applied. And Austin had its own flavor of that, this idea that individual liberty and minimal government and all of that of libertarianism. But also mixed with the sort of anti-establishment, peace, loving, social tolerance, creativity and sort of whimsical weirdness all mesh together in Austin.

And people tell the story of when Willie Nelson jumped on the stage at the old Armadillo World Headquarters and sang Blue Eyes Cryin' in the Rain, he married the rednecks and the hippies. And we realized we could all get along and there was this sort of kumbaya moment. And again, even though it's overly romanticized, there's an element of truth to that that carried the city through into the 1980s.

CHAKRABARTI: Yeah. Right now, my heart is weeping along with my fellow Oregonians, particularly in Portland, aka ""weird Portland,"" people there who are lamenting the loss of the sort of rain-soaked, mossy version of what you just described as Austin having been.

So the thing is, though, that I find particularly interesting, and correct me if I'm wrong, it's as I said earlier, cities do change, but it seems as if in the past, maybe decade, or at least couple of decades, the pace at which things have been transforming in Austin is much, much higher than perhaps we've seen elsewhere. And that is part of the issue.

LONG: Oh, no question. Whether it's politically or culturally or socially or whether we've seen the displacement of certain populations and other populations moving in, things have definitely changed. And it's something that's hard to put your finger on. It's hard to really describe a sense of place. But the vibe of Austin has changed.

When I was doing research from my book back in the early 2000s all the way up through 2008, 2009, it was very easy to do that kind of work, because everybody I talked to had an opinion. I could just walk up to people on the street and they'd start saying something and want to talk about Austin. I don't know if I could do that research again today in Austin,

CHAKRABARTI: Because they wouldn't have an opinion?

LONG: Oh, they might have an opinion, but they're too busy to get to work.

Part II

CHAKRABARTI: Now we heard from a lot of Austinites who listen to On Point on KUT in Austin, for example. Here's Christopher Hutchins.

CHRISTOPHER HUTCHINS: It was a freak town, where you could be whoever you wanted to be, and that was okay. There's plenty of things to do outdoors, tons of music and art to consume. That is still here. It's just not as inclusive. All the freaks and the queers and the artists are still here. We're not going away.

CHAKRABARTI: And here's Robert Cullick. He was a journalist on the growth beat for a local newspaper in the 1980s.

ROBERT CULLICK: In Old Austin, it was a young person's culture. One came to Austin from a more conservative place in Texas and experienced the heady feeling of intellectual and, certainly, physical freedom. So you stayed to protect and nurture that feeling. One assumed one's waiter had a PhD, 'cause there was a good chance he or she did.

Well, in New Austin, people move here for good jobs and bigger homes than they can get in California and to experience some of the creative spirit and music and art that's been left behind. But it's just smoke and not much fire.

CHAKRABARTI: Here's one more. This is Marty Butler. He says his parents moved to Austin in the late 1960s and he's lived there for some 50 years.

MARTY BUTLER: There's been booms in the past, but nothing like what's happened over the last 20 years, where Austin really became a place that you could come to get rich. I'm now surrounded by homes with incomes probably above half a million dollars a year.

It has not necessarily ruined the city. There's still a lot of Austin that's intact, but the change is marked. And this is what we have to recognize, that Austin is not what it used to be, but it's still pretty damn good.

CHAKRABARTI: Joshua Long joins us today. He's a professor at Southwestern University and author of Weird City: Sense of Place and Creative Resistance in Austin, Texas.

And professor Long, look, I'm just gonna be totally transparent about like, I am not a Texan, not an Austinite. So I really wanna actually just spend a few more minutes digging into the texture and cultural history of the city to help us who aren't of the soil there to understand why this issue of change in Austin matters so much to people.

Because as an outsider, I've always actually wondered why Austin was able to retain this hippie, libertarian feel, especially as the capital of the state of Texas, which, especially in the past quarter century, has, to an outsider's view, become a bastion of just like deep conservatism. Does that make sense?

LONG: Yeah. It does make sense. And Austin, for a long time, I think it's important to remember that Austin for a very long time was a very affordable place to live. And a place where you didn't, it was never a city of elites. It was never a city of influencers, we have become that most recently.

But how Austin came to be this in the '70s and '80s is more of a relatively middle class and affordable place was that Austin was often in the shadow of cities like Dallas and Houston and San Antonio, and it was the capital city. And it was a place where people who were trying to get away from the conservatism of deep red Texas came to this blue oasis in search for something different.

Started in the 1960s, for sure, when the University of Texas population doubled in the decade. And in the 1970s as the outlaw country and cosmic cowboy music scenes started to take off, that added a certain element to it as well. And that started to transform a little bit as we got into the 1980s, because Austin really started to tell a story about itself.

And actually, that's something that we should talk about. Because rather than a traditional sort of timeline history of Austin, the city loves to tell stories about itself and who it is, and those often-become self-fulfilling prophecies.

CHAKRABARTI: Okay. One second though, because before we get to what some of those stories are, just to not sound totally ignorant about how diverse Texas actually is. I mean there were other like major blue spots in the state. I was just in Houston, so it's not like Austin is this single blueberry, right, in the tomato soup?

LONG: Oh, you're absolutely right that Houston and San Antonio especially are places that, especially now, do embrace that kind of lifestyle.

But if you're thinking about the 1960s and seventies in rural Texas, the University of Texas, especially, was a sort of beacon to a lot of young people who wanted to get away from that strict conservatism. And they didn't go towards the fancy — forgive me for saying this — the highfalutin' Dallas area or the oil money in Houston, they went to Austin for the music scene, for the counterculture vibes. And that's what drew a lot of that.

CHAKRABARTI: I got you. Okay. So tell me what, like what's one of the stories that the city loved to tell about itself?

LONG: (LAUGHS)

CHAKRABARTI: (LAUGHS) You're setting yourself up for these questions!

LONG: (LAUGHS) I know. You're right. So coming outta the 1970s, where we very much trying to portray ourself as this laid back, if you come here, try to be tolerant, be creative, be whimsical. We love our weirdos here, we don't care where you come from, just relax and enjoy the city.

That actually started to change in the in late '70s and 1980s when the growth machine in Austin started to come together and say, we need to attract some businesses here. Now there's alternative to this. There are many people who were very anti-growth at the time. That was a very strong sentiment. But the University of Texas, the Austin Chamber of Commerce, which was incredibly influential, and many of the other developers and business interests in Austin started to actively recruit industries to Austin. Specifically, the tech scene, software development, advanced manufacturing.

We started to get IBM and Motorola and Samsung and 3M and Texas Instruments. And that actually meshed well in some ways with the hippie libertarianism. Because if you think about it, another place in the United States where the term hippie libertarianism gets applied is Silicon Valley. And here we were telling everybody that we were the new Silicon Hills, just cheaper, more affordable, and a great place to hang out and spend the time in between your software development job.

CHAKRABARTI: So how did, it seems to me though, that like you, you call it the growth machine, but the growth machine, a growth machine works well in an environment that is also, laissez-faire, right? Like that libertarian streak. ""Come as you are. Grow as you want?""

LONG: Sure. And Austin still embodies that and has for a long time. In many ways it's actually been, it's actually been to our detriment to a certain extent. Because again, if I'm telling these stories and I'm reproducing this narrative, they're dominant political narratives. They're inherently exclusionary.

And by me telling these stories, I'm not telling the stories of the people who end up being displaced by that growth machine. Because we started to embark, especially, if we're going to fast forward towards the 1990s. When we started to bring in environmentalism as part of our ethos and we monetized environmentalism and we started to say, okay, let's, you know, historians talk about the Green Council, the late 1990s that came together and initiated a lot of smart growth.

Smart growth in theory is really great, but you have to put in protections for your existing communities. Because as you densify, you are going to, in a free market, real estate economy, you're going to drive up real estate prices, rents, and in a place like Texas, you're going to increase property taxes as well.

CHAKRABARTI: I promise you, in just one minute we're gonna talk with someone — who you're sitting right next to, actually — about the real big negative challenges of rapid neighborhood change. But there's one more thing about this libertarian streak. Because again, externally from outside of Austin, it's like people are like, ""Wow, Joe Rogan lives there. Elon Musk is moving there. This must be something crazy new."" But that sort of part of the city has always been there.

LONG: Yes, it has. And it's always been there. We talk about hippie Austin, but you don't always talk about Bubba South Austin. That is another term that comes up.

CHAKRABARTI: Or Alex Jones Austin.

LONG: I have to say, we do have this history of conspiracy theorists living in Austin. We are the home of Infowars, unfortunately. But actually, conspiracy theories on the left and the right. Because there's always been this kind of distrust of the establishment in government in Austin.

So in some ways, you can see how these sorts of evolve over time to include different people and including people like Joe Rogan and Elon Musk. And if we wanna talk about that later, we have to think about when they moved here. Joe Rogan moved here in 2020 and he was outspokenly critical of COVID policies in California and talking about how in Austin, they let you do what you want.

And it was this budding comedy scene that he was going to incubate. And at first, we saw moving in and we were like, ""Ah, another Californian, spent $14.5 million dollars on a Lake Austin home. Telling all his buddies from California to move here."" It's evolved over time. Pros and cons there.

CHAKRABARTI: Okay. Professor Long, hang on for just a second because I'm long overdue in bringing Susana Almanza into the conversation. She also joins us from KUT in Austin, and she's director of the advocacy group PODER and a longtime East Austin resident. Susana, welcome to On Point.

SUSANA ALMANZA: Hello, Meghna. Thank you.

CHAKRABARTI: Tell me a little bit about East Austin, what it was like, what it's like now.

ALMANZA: East Austin is, for people don't know, the city of Austin did its master plan in 1928, and in that master plan it decided that people of color would live east of the highway. So Highway 35 became our border wall.

And we built our homes from anywhere from $2,000 to $18,000 in East Austin. And we made it the beautiful part of the city for people of color. So we had our own small businesses, mom and pops. We had our own transportation, taxi service, Latino, African American. We had our own beauty shops and we had, of course, our segregated schools in East Austin.

Growing up in East Austin, I'm a native of East Austin. Of course, we had, we didn't have paved streets and there was very little lighting. The drainage system wasn't the best. But it was a happy place because it was a social network there where we had cousins, aunts, grandmas, everybody living in the area. And it was extended families, and it was all about families. At that time, I think the average family size was like eight to 10 people. I knew I grew up in a family of 10. So it was a lot of families in the areas.

There was a lot of celebrations. A lot of different parks in the community that we did, transportation was not as heavy. Because in that era, before up to the seventies, there wasn't a lot of people who owned vehicles. So there wasn't heavy traffic until ""your job is your credit"" came in and people were able to get vehicles. But it was a very walkable community. Very walkable community. And it was a community where we were allowed to have, we had our own chickens and rabbits. We ate everything pretty fresh, had our gardens.

And so it was a time where I looked at where I had to walk across Highway 35 every day just to go to elementary school. And I could tell you Highway 35 is nothing like it is today. I wouldn't be able to walk it, the traffic or especially as a child. Trying to cross 35. So the atmosphere is very different, in people of color living together, but also working-class community.

CHAKRABARTI: Okay. So tell me more about that, because it sounds like what you're headed towards is that sense of community which I want, I do want to just emphasize. That was created in part by like deliberate planned segregation, as you said. That sense of community, affordability, sounds like that's changing even in East Austin.

ALMANZA: Absolutely. East Austin is going under, it's gentrified, being gentrified, but we say that gentrification is a new name for colonization. Because what has happened is as Austin continues to grow, where does it grow? To the west, it has a lot of restrictions, and they have a lot of people in power that they're gonna make sure that they keep their single-family homes and that they control the type of growth. In East Austin has always been different, because East Austin has been trying to treat it like the stepchild or the orphan child.

So zoning has come in, we went through industrial zoning, which meant that you could have a factory that was emitting chemicals next door to a school or to your home. So you are allowed to live with industrial emissions, industrial traffic in the area. That's very different from West Austin. It was very much protected.

And that was one of the reasons that PODER came about. Because when we look at all the hazardous facilities in our community and we actually got the city to do a study, and it turned out that 90% of all the industrial zoning was in East Austin.

CHAKRABARTI: 90%?

ALMANZA: 90% of all the industrial zoning was in East Austin.

CHAKRABARTI: Wow.

ALMANZA: And because of the zoning, we could be living next to these hazardous facilities. And so that's the kind of Austin that people don't hear about. The history of how racism and zoning has played on Austin, and on how, now that Austin is growing, it came in with new kind of zoning, that never existed before in our communities. Commercial service, mixed use, vertical mixed use, all of these different things have been used to take over our community.

In 1997, the city came out with a plan where it would say, we're gonna go through a neighborhood process and we're going to divide the city into 54 neighborhood planning areas. And so they started with the neighborhood plan in East Austin, one that became the Cesar Chavez Neighborhood plan. And the other one was a Chestnut neighborhood plan and the Chestnut with the African Americans and ours was basically Latinos.

When they came in and changed the zoning, and we were involved in that process. We fought it because it introduced a zoning that never had existed before, commercial service mixed use. Which they said, okay, these houses are going to now, homes, single family homes, are gonna be zoned commercial service mixed use. And we said, if you do that, then people who don't own their homes are gonna get displaced.

CHAKRABARTI: I see.

ALMANZA: Because people are gonna get more money rented at commercial services and they're not gonna qualify for equity loans. Because equity loans had just come in, because they're not zoned residential, they're not gonna qualify for federal money, for rehabilitation or anything else, because they're zoned commercial.

CHAKRABARTI: Susana, can I just jump in here for a quick second? We have to take a break in just 30 seconds. But why did they wanna change the zoning to begin with?

ALMANZA: That was a way to take over and displace the community. You change the zoning, and you displace people. That is, how do you take over the land?

CHAKRABARTI: They wanted the land for someone else.

ALMANZA: They wanted the land. It was a land grab.

Part III

CHAKRABARTI: Professor Long, can you just pick up on what Susana was describing as this rapid change for the Latino and Black lifelong residents of Austin? Because I think obviously what she's describing is very familiar to people in other cities, right? Boston, Seattle, San Francisco, you name it, Chicago.

It's gentrification with a capital G. But I understand that you said, you told our producer, Claire, that Austinites themselves had a hard time calling it that.

LONG: Well, I don't know about that. I think it was late for us to be having that conversation. Because initially, it was all about, it was driven largely by economic growth and an environmental ethos that said we need to protect our watershed which we did to the west. And we needed to zone a little bit better for more dense use, which we did. And we needed more public transportation, but in not putting in protections for the existing population, we created a real problem.

Because alongside this, Austin was trying to portray itself as the new creative center of the United States, like it was an emerging major international city and saying we want musicians, artists and young creatives to come to this city. When they come to the city, it's still hard for some people to find a place to live where the affordable place is. It was East Austin, central East Austin especially, and I think the city looked at that and was like, that is a place where we can extract value.

And the reason that's a story that's common to many other cities is because we live in a very neoliberal capitalist world. Where everything, you can put a price on the value of a person, on the value of their labor, on the value of their property. And East Austin house prices were so low, and it was such a place where, you know, as you start to direct growth in that way, property values go up, rents go up. That's displacing populations.

But a story that's not often told about Texas cities is how quickly our property taxes can go up. And I know Susana will have something to say about that.

CHAKRABARTI: Oh, okay. We'll talk about that in a second. But there's one more thing, because this is like a number that very, it brings this, the rapidity of the change into stark relief. Because Austin has had obviously population growth and a lot of it between censuses, between the 2010 and 2020 census.

But in that same time, what, professor, has been, for example, the decline in the African American population in Austin?

LONG: Oh, yeah. There's a statistic that's pretty alarming across the decades, but between 2000 and 2010, Austin saw a 20% population growth rate while it witnessed between a five and 6% decrease in its African American population.

And that's a statistical outlier from the rest of the United States. So while we were growing, we were simultaneously hemorrhaging largely our Black population, but also our Latino population.

CHAKRABARTI: Okay. So Professor Long and Susana Almanza. Hang on for just a second, because we did actually speak with a member of the Austin City Council, Ryan Alter. He's a councilman for the fifth district in Austin. And he told us that the council is working hard to build more affordable housing. But he says the city's median family income — this is important — has skyrocketed, so it's tough to keep prices accessible.

RYAN ALTER: You used to have a whole lot of individuals or families who an 80% median family income unit, that was very accessible for them, and now they can only afford something that's restricted to 50% or even 30%. Those units are much more costly to build, and so you just don't have as many of them. That imbalance has been a huge challenge that we've been trying to rectify and put back into balance. But our MFI shot up so fast that playing catch up has been really difficult.

CHAKRABARTI: By the way, the median family income in Austin, Texas right now is approximately $126,000 in comparison to the roughly $80,000 national median family income.

So Ryan Alter says it's hard to get developers to agree to build housing that would meet the needs or the capabilities of people making 30% to 50% of Austin's, again, Austin's median family income. And he says sometimes creating some slightly more affordable units at that 80% is better than nothing at all.

ALTER: We calibrate these density bonus programs so that you can have a higher percentage of units that are less affordable or a lower percentage of units that are more affordable. So incentivizing that, even if we don't get quite as many of the raw number of affordable units, if they're more affordable, then we're serving a segment of the population that is just underserved.

We're not allowed to condition zoning on affordability. That's something that in Texas is prohibited by law. This council has made it very clear that affordability is a top priority, and so when developers come to ask for zoning, they are free to say, look, I'm gonna set aside 5%, 10%, because I know that's gonna be attractive when they're reviewing this case.

CHAKRABARTI: Even if they solved this issue of what is affordable in Austin, Ryan Alter says, the bottom line is the city needs to build more housing, period.

ALTER: I think the proof's in the pudding. When you supply the units, prices go down and we have seen that. People will say, ""You guys rose so fast that even some kind of decline, you're still way above everybody else."" And there is some element of truth to that. I'm not going to pretend that we didn't see meteoric rise for four years.

We have a, what is called the strategic housing blueprint. It is our guide to exactly that question. How many units do we need? That 10-year plan, when we adopted it five years ago, I think it was 135,000 new housing units. That's a lot. We have built a lot of those, but we are behind.

CHAKRABARTI: That's Ryan Alter. He represents Austin's fifth district on the city council. Susana Almanza, would you like to respond to what the councilman was saying there?

ALMANZA: Yeah, I think that Councilman and the whole city council is not being truthful. The city of Austin owns thousands of properties that it acquired through liens or through purchase. That was a study done by Professor Eliot Tretter and his class.

And so we know that the city has all this land that is just land banking. So when you look at, we've given this recommendation to the city for decades, is that if we own the land, because that's city land, that means we, the taxpayers, own that land. Then what really drives up the price of homes is the land. But if you own the land, you can build housing from 0%, 30%, 40%, or 50% medium family income. The ability is there. What the community says is they don't have the ganas, they don't have the will, to do it.

So they try to say that they're doing all this by all of their different housing policies, of doing 10% affordability and so forth, when in reality they don't tell the truth. That they can actually build thousands of homes for all ranges of income if they really wanted to.

The truth is that Austin doesn't want low income and people of color in the urban core. That's the truth. If you look at their stats, they've built, and this is their own, it came out from 2018 to 2022. They built 35,000 units from 61% to 121% medium family income. And they only built 6,847 units from 30% to 60% income. So that's really, that's the real telling. That's the truth there. Who are they building for?

CHAKRABARTI: Susana? Can I just jump in here and ask?

ALMANZA: Sure.

CHAKRABARTI: I definitely hear what you're saying. As I mentioned earlier, I'm based here in Boston and this, it's like you're saying the exact same version of what's happening here. I actually reported for years on East Boston, happens to also be on the east side of the city, longtime home of especially Latino immigrants, but many immigrants. And the exact same story.

But let me challenge you a little bit with this. I hear what you're saying in terms of they, quote-unquote, they don't want people of color in the urban core of Austin. But isn't it even, is it less pointed than that and just this is the general outcome of what happens with capitalism and when a city becomes extremely attractive to people with a lot of money? I don't think I've seen any city solve this problem yet.

ALMANZA: I think what makes that city attractive? What makes it attractive? If it's when you have the council, you have the Austin Real Estate Council, the Board of Realtors, Chamber of Commerce, when you have all these people working together and planning a city and recruiting whatever employment agencies and so forth, without taking into regard that there are poor people of color living in an area.

When they passed a desired development zone, that desired development zone was east of the highway. Yes, it's part of capitalism, but it's also part of racism and we cannot live out the r-word. Okay, it's part of racism. It's, who do you target? Who is the most vulnerable population, and who has experienced racism from the very beginning of the establishment of the United States? It's the indigenous people of this continent.

So when you have to look at it, you have to see how land use and zoning has a history that's rooted in racism. And so yes, you have racism and then you have capitalism. And we ourselves, the people, have come up with the people's plan. When the city was continuing to the height of its growth, they say we don't just want to hear you all, come up with some plans.

We come up with plans and we come up with recommendations. We even wrote the resolution so that they wouldn't have to start from zero scratch, and some we borrowed from other states and cities that we thought were progressive and were doing the right thing. And when we presented those, again, they start to water them down and before you know it, they fall in this hole.

So it's not like people are not trying to bring on the changes and that they're not aware of what is happening in a city that's growing so fast as Austin, right? It's that you pretend that one section of the city is empty and you plan as if that city is, that portion of the city is empty without taking into regard who built this city.

CHAKRABARTI: I see.

ALMANZA: And looking at diversity. Looking at how do we retain these people? And I think that those are the things that we really need to look at. When we look throughout the United States and not just the United States, the world. Because gentrification is happening throughout the world. So you can see what's happening in the world and then see what's happening in Austin, Texas.

CHAKRABARTI: So professor Long, pick up on what Susana is saying. Because I think part of the reason why it's very hard for city councils to politically make the kinds of decisions that Susana and PODER are calling for is because there's always this fear, even amongst the quote-unquote most progressive city councils, that doing these kinds of changes will, developers will come back and say this reduces our ROI, so we're just not going to build there at all.

LONG: I think that is actually an important part of the conversation. Because we are so reliant on public-private partnerships and bringing in certain developers, they are very concerned with profit. And the city of Austin often throws its hands up and says, we can't do this because we can't be attractive to developers. We could subsidize that. It would take an effort, and it would take, it would actually take a community effort wide from the city to do it, but we could subsidize those efforts.

There's something else that Susana hasn't brought up yet and 'cause she's awful humble when it comes to this. Is that when it comes to East Austin, one of the reasons it became an attractive place is because PODER and other groups fought to clean it up.

We're talking about a place that had quite a bit of pollution in various different ways. Had a massive power plant that was having fire fires on a weekly basis and causing all kinds of noise and other forms of pollution in the area. And there were other facilities as well that they fought quite hard to be removed.

And as soon as those, the power plant was decommissioned, as soon as the fuel storage areas started to get removed, suddenly it was a cleaner, greener place and you had more open space. And the city looked at that and said, ""That's a desired development zone. That's where we're going to go in."" And for a long time, they had a lot of, not only legal, but community support to remove those things. But you can get environmental justice, but that economic justice is still late in coming.

CHAKRABARTI: If there isn't what you called for earlier, which is as this growth is happening, the protections that are put in for existing residents. And Susana, you were talking about how PODER has a plan for that. We only have a minute left, Susana, but like, when you presented this plan to city leaders, what was their response?

ALMANZA: One of the things is that they're gonna look at it and then they're gonna, which council will support what resolution. And then again, there's a study and then it just sits there on the shelf. That's usually the way it is.

CHAKRABARTI: Yeah, they'll say it's endlessly in committee. Where good ideas go to die. Sorry. I just, I'm a little jaded about state politics. But professor Long, again, in this last minute, help me find a way to wrap this up again and bring the relevance of what's happening in Austin to the rest of America.

Because what do you think the lessons are that Austin has to teach the rest of us about how to cope or what not to do in coping with rapid growth?

LONG: I think be careful about how much you wish growth to happen. And whether or not your economic sustainability as a city is really dependent on growth and expansion, because that is a story that is not going away.

And maybe the next time you'll have us on, we're talking about development east of the city and in the surrounding counties, because one of the areas that has not been developed is east of Austin. And whether it's data centers or advanced manufacturing or semiconductor plants, all of those communities east of Austin — which by the way, were places that a lot of people who were displaced from East Austin moved to those communities, because they're the only place they could afford. Now they're getting priced out again, and they're seeing growth come up all around them.

This program is here locally in the Ann Arbor area with the Washtenaw 2030 District, who is acting as the local host organization.

This month it was announced, the Michigan Infrastructure Office (MIO) Technical Assistance Center (TAC), in partnership with the Michigan Infrastructure Council (MIC) and the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy (EGLE), will help organizations access reimbursements of 30 percent or more for their clean energy investments.

In announcing the program, the MIO said, “Michiganders from across the state have been selected as Elective Pay Ambassadors to help nonprofits, schools, local governments, Tribal Nations, houses of worship and other tax-exempt entities bring federal funding to Michigan’s communities.”

According to the announcement, the MIO “is responsible for organizing and executing Governor Whitmer’s vision for infrastructure, coordinating across state government, marshaling resources, and partnering with local officials, federal partners, and outside stakeholders to ensure resources sent to Michigan through BIL, also known as the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), are used efficiently and effectively.”

The gist of the announcement is: Michigan’s Elective Pay Ambassador Program Makes It Easier for Entities to Access Federal Clean Energy Tax Credits.

By placing trained Ambassadors in trusted community organizations, we’re making it easier for eligible entities to understand the process, file for the tax credits, and receive the federal dollars they’ve earned,” Kris Brady, director of MIO TAC, said in the announcement. “Elective Pay offers real, tangible financial benefits for schools, local governments, nonprofits, and houses of worship, entities that are often balancing tight budgets while delivering essential services to their communities. This support helps communities lower costs, upgrade infrastructure, and keep more resources focused on the people they serve.”

After a competitive application process, the MIO TAC said it has awarded grants to seven nonprofits across Michigan that will host the Elective Pay Ambassadors. The Ambassadors’ job is simple but powerful: help community institutions access federal clean energy tax credits through Elective Pay, a mechanism that allows eligible organizations to receive reimbursements of up to 30 percent or more of their project costs.

The Ambassadors for Washtenaw 2030 District are Kim Heumann, a local government resilience specialist and Lissa Spitz, a longtime architect and sustainability advocate. The MIO said Ambassadors have begun receiving training on Elective Pay and will act as local experts, serving the Prosperity Region in which they are located.

“Despite the significant financial benefits of Elective Pay, awareness of this relatively new tool remains low, and many tax-exempt organizations face challenges navigating filing a tax return for the first time in order to claim the reimbursement,” the MIO announcement said. “The Ambassador program was created to close this gap and make the process easier for local leaders who are improving their communities by investing in clean energy technologies such as solar, energy storage, geothermal, and more.”

The Washtenaw 2030 District is a public-private-nonprofit collaborative working to reduce building related greenhouse gas emissions by 50-65 percent by 2030 and eliminating emissions by 2040 while increasing Washtenaw County’s competitiveness in the business environment and increasing owners’ return on investment.

The MIO said the program provides stipends to host organizations (nonprofits) that host Elective Pay Ambassadors who will host educational events on Elective Pay, raise awareness about MIO TAC’s Elective Pay resources and technical assistance services, and ensure Elective Pay is embedded in clean energy project planning. The EPAP will run for one year.

Sometimes it can pay to wait until an overvalued stock gets cheap enough to earn a place in your portfolio. And with shares down by over 80% from their peak, Rivian Automotive (RIVN +0.71%) might deserve a closer look.

Let's dig deeper to find out if the embattled electric vehicle (EV) maker can bounce back as it expands its business model and potentially benefits from a thinning of the competition as rival automakers begin to abandon their fully electric ambitions.

The EV industry faces serious challenges

When Rivian hit the market through an initial public offering (IPO) in late 2021, electric vehicles (EVs) were all the rage. Analysts boldly predicted that the new technology would quickly replace traditional gasoline-powered vehicles and potentially boost the industry's profit potential as early leaders like Tesla demonstrated incredible growth and margins.

Behind the scenes, governments around the world were putting their thumb on the scales to support the industry. In the U.S., this took the form of tax and regulatory credits to support demand while making EV production more competitive relative to gasoline-powered vehicles. However, this year, the Trump administration has rolled back these incentives with disastrous consequences for the once-burgeoning industry.

According to Reuters, overall U.S. EV sales sank by more than 41% in November, following the removal of a $7,500 tax credit that expired in October. Investors should expect continued weakness in the near term -- although over a longer time horizon, improving battery technology and changing consumer habits could spark a resumption of growth.

The crisis might have a silver lining for Rivian

While the loss of U.S. tax credits and other incentives will hurt the American EV industry as a whole, Rivian is much better positioned to weather the fallout than some of its rivals. For starters, many of the company's vehicles didn't even qualify for the $7,500 tax credit because of battery sourcing requirements and MSRPs that were too high. More importantly, the reduction in government support is already helping to thin the herd and stem the competition from legacy automakers.

In December, Ford Motor Company announced an eye-popping $19.5 billion in writedowns as it restructures its business and scraps planned new all-electric models. The company has totally cancelled its once-promising Ford-150 lighting, which competes directly with Rivian's R1T pickup truck.

Over the next few years, pure-play electric automakers like Rivian will have the opportunity to capture more market share in a smaller, but dramatically less competitive EV industry, while traditional U.S. automakers return their focus to gasoline-powered vehicles and hybrids.

The Trump administration's aggressive tariff policy could also add another layer of protection for Rivian by making imports less competitive. The California-based company makes most of its cars at its main factory in Illinois.

Is Rivian stock a buy in 2026?

For investing, numbers tend to speak louder than words. And Rivian's operational results are getting more encouraging. Despite the uncertainty in the EV industry, third-quarter revenue soared 78% year over year to $1.56 billion because of solid automotive sales and a surge in software and services revenue, which adds much-needed diversification.

Rivian has established itself as a leader in vehicle electrical and software development, which may have something to do with its start-up culture and the type of tech-related talent available in California compared to traditional automotive hubs. Reuters reports that its joint venture with Volkswagen is attracting attention from other automotive companies that are interested in incorporating its architecture into their vehicles.

This energy will not only support Superior but the surrounding areas that are growing in the East Valley and Copper Corridor.
For the Town of Superior, battery storage means emission-free energy, construction jobs and millions of dollars in lease revenue over the life of the project.
There is no one-size-fits-all plan to meet Arizona energy demand.
Mila Besich was elected Mayor of the Town of Superior in 2016, and re-elected in 2018 and 2022.","For 150 years, the people of Superior built this town with their bare hands.

Our rural community was carved from the Superstition Mountains like the silver and copper mines that dot this area – an indelible link to both our past and future.

Now, as Superior experiences an economic resurgence brought about by industries old and new, our town continues to envision and chart its own path. This time, with energy.

Like water, access to reliable and affordable energy is essential to every Arizona community. Superior is growing. We remain a small town of roughly 2,500 residents, but our downtown district is buzzing. A new generation of travelers and tourists is discovering Superior and our unique shops, restaurants and beautiful natural surroundings – all less than an hour from metro Phoenix.

Mining is also a big part of our story, of course. Resolution Copper is prepared to create thousands of local jobs as it pulls enough copper out of the ground to supply an estimated 25% of North America’s copper demand. We are working hard to keenly target the development of affordable housing and recruitment of quality employers so there are more places to live and work for Superior families.

None of this is possible without affordable, reliable power.

To help provide the energy Superior needs to thrive, we have proposed to SRP a local parcel for construction of a Battery Electric Storage System (BESS). The facility, when completed, will be capable of producing 100-150 MW for four hours at a time – enough to power over 25,000 homes during peak demand on summer evenings. This energy will not only support Superior but the surrounding areas that are growing in the East Valley and Copper Corridor.

The beauty of a battery storage system like this is it can be charged when demand is low (and power is less expensive) and utilized when demand and energy costs are high. That improves reliability and saves money on the power homes and businesses need.

Arizona has nearly 3,900 MW of operational battery storage statewide, with plans to nearly double this portfolio by 2026. Already, Arizona is among the Top 3 states in the nation in terms of deployed, utility-scale battery storage.

For the Town of Superior, battery storage means emission-free energy, construction jobs and millions of dollars in lease revenue over the life of the project. But SRP’s broader network of customers will also benefit since the battery power is more than enough for Superior’s current needs and will flow to the grid.

The need for more energy in our state is growing. Arizona’s major utilities – SRP, APS and Tucson Electric Power – all broke records this past summer for peak demand. Energy consumption is forecast to only keep climbing as our state grows and the economy requires more energy for manufacturing, data processing and other key industries. Rural Arizona must look at these energy opportunities, not only to serve its own residents but also to be actively engaged and leading to ensure the power grid is sustainable statewide.

There is no one-size-fits-all plan to meet Arizona energy demand. We need coal, natural gas, nuclear, renewables and other new technologies. Utility-scale battery storage is a critical part of the equation.

As Vice Chairman Nick Myers of the Arizona Corporation Commission said: “Battery storage not only supports grid stability, it ensures that renewable energy is available into the evening when the sun isn’t shining. Adding significant storage capacity is critical to maintaining a reliable and resilient grid.”

It’s fitting and I’m proud that the people of Superior are helping lead the way by taking control of our own energy future.

“This order will pass tens of millions in costs to Colorado rate payers, in order to keep a coal plant open that is broken and not needed.
Tri-State, which co-owns the Craig Power Station with several other utilities, has planned to close its Craig Unit 1 since 2016 for economic reasons and to comply with federal and state emissions-reduction requirements.
On Wednesday, Colorado Energy Office executive director Will Toor said the state does not have an electricity shortage that would warrant invoking the Federal Power Act to keep Craig Unit 1 open.
Craig Unit 1’s closure follows a careful planning process that determined replacing or repairing the aging coal-burning plant would cost more than investing in newer, more renewable forms of electricity, he said.","The Trump administration, in its ongoing push to boost fossil fuels, issued an emergency order Tuesday to keep an aging coal-fired power plant in Craig operating even though it is broken, out of operation and was scheduled to be retired this week.

The move puts Tri-State Generation and Transmission Association in a bind as it tries to figure out how to comply with the order after years of planning to shutter the old Unit 1 plant — and after a Dec. 19 malfunction caused an outage at the unit that will be expensive to repair.

“Tri-State has a policy of 100% compliance, and we will work with Unit 1 co-owners, and federal and state governments to determine the most cost-effective path to that end,” Duane Highley, Tri-State CEO, said in a news release Wednesday. “We are continuing to review the order to determine what this means for Craig Station employees and operations, and the financial impacts. As a not-for-profit cooperative, our membership will bear the costs of compliance with this order unless we can identify a method to share costs with those in the region. There is not a clear path for doing so, but we will continue to evaluate our options.”

The order, which was issued Tuesday night by Energy Secretary Chris Wright, was criticized by Gov. Jared Polis, who said it will cost utility ratepayers more money because the plant needs millions of dollars in repairs to be brought back online.

Colorado does not have an emergency need for electricity, the governor said in an emailed statement.

Environmentalists said reopening the old plant would harm public health as it pumps climate-changing carbon emissions into the air and goes against Colorado’s plan to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions to net-zero by 2025.

“This order will pass tens of millions in costs to Colorado rate payers, in order to keep a coal plant open that is broken and not needed. Ludicrously, the coal plant isn’t even operational right now, meaning repairs — to the tune of millions of dollars — just to get it running, all on the backs of rural Colorado ratepayers! Going backwards is an attempt to force local communities to foot the bill to extend plant operations, and will cost energy consumers more,” Polis’s statement said. “Today’s action flies in the face of this careful planning, is inconsistent with market forces, and will hurt Coloradans.”

The emergency order will keep Tri-State Generation and Transmission Association’s Unit 1 at the Craig Station in Moffat County open for at least another 90 days. Tri-State has until Jan. 20 to explain to the energy department how it plans to get Unit 1 running and to provide an update on environmental and operational impacts, according to the order. Wright could also renew the order.

Tri-State, which co-owns the Craig Power Station with several other utilities, has planned to close its Craig Unit 1 since 2016 for economic reasons and to comply with federal and state emissions-reduction requirements. The company has based its operational and maintenance decisions on that plan and has adequate resources to maintain power reliability, the Westminster-based company’s news release stated.

Unit 1 stopped operating on Dec. 19 when a valve failed and caused an outage, the company’s news release said. Now Tri-State and the other co-owners will need to repair the valve.

As a result of the order, retaining Unit 1 will require additional financial investments in operations, repairs, maintenance and, potentially, fuel supply. All those factors will increase costs, the company’s news release stated. Tri-State is continuing to review the order to determine how best to comply while limiting the costs to its members, and the impacts to its employees and operations, it said.

Tri-State is planning to close two other coal-fired units at the Craig Station in 2028.

President Donald Trump’s agenda is to increase the nation’s use of fossil fuels, and since he took office in January, he has set about trying to save the dying coal industry through executive orders, large sales of coal from public lands, regulatory relief and offers of hundreds of millions of dollars to restore coal plants.

Colorado is just one state where Wright, who is from Colorado and the founder of an oil-and-gas fracking company, has ordered coal plants to stay open. On Dec. 23, he issued orders to keep open two coal-burning power plants in Indiana.

Environmental groups are suing the Trump administration over its use of the Federal Power Act, arguing the president is abusing his power because there is no national emergency in supplying electricity.

On Wednesday, Colorado Energy Office executive director Will Toor said the state does not have an electricity shortage that would warrant invoking the Federal Power Act to keep Craig Unit 1 open.

In a statement, Toor said the North American Electric Reliability Corporation, a nonprofit with international regulatory authority that monitors the power grid, has found no short-term or long-term reliability risks in the Rocky Mountain region. Craig Unit 1’s closure follows a careful planning process that determined replacing or repairing the aging coal-burning plant would cost more than investing in newer, more renewable forms of electricity, he said.

“These orders will take money out of the pockets of Colorado ratepayers, and especially harm rural communities across the West who could be forced to absorb the unnecessary excess costs required to keep this plant operational,” Toor’s statement said.

But in his order, Wright wrote that he intends to keep Craig open because the electric reliability corporation has reported that the Rocky Mountain region has more variability in its electrical grid than other regions because of a large share of “wind and hydro in its portfolio.”

Wright cited a Western Electricity Coordinating Council assessment that said Colorado’s demand for power is expected to grow by 8.5% to 36 gigawatts from 33 gigawatts by 2034 and that shuttering coal plants will make it hard for the state to meet that demand.

“As described above, the emergency conditions resulting from increasing demand and shortage from accelerated retirement of generation facilities will continue in the near term and are also likely to continue in subsequent years,” the order stated. “This could lead to the loss of power to homes and businesses in the areas that may be affected by curtailments or power outages, presenting a risk to public health and safety.”

Still, Colorado officials and environmentalists said the energy secretary’s assessment is incorrect.

“The Trump administration is engaging in Soviet-style central planning, driven by ideology rather than the realities of the electric grid, that will drive dirtier air and higher electric rates across our state. These orders are unlawful and will not improve energy security in Colorado or the region,” Toor wrote.

Colorado environmental advocates, including GreenLatinos, EarthJustice and the National Parks Conservation Association, denounced the emergency order as a move that will make the state’s air dirtier, harming public health and staining views from the state’s beloved parks.

The Colorado Air Quality Control Commission specifically cited Unit 1’s retirement as part of its plan to reduce haze in Colorado.

“This order puts our communities at risk and turns back progress that Coloradans have fought tirelessly for,” Jessica Herrera, in-house counsel for GreenLatinos, said in a news release. “Once again, the administration is putting the fossil fuel industry before our health and well-being.”

Earthjustice, a nonprofit that provides legal representation to other environmental groups, said Thursday that it is prepared to take action to defend Colorado and to advocate for a just transition to cleaner energy sources.

“Keeping this dirty and outdated coal plant online will harm the health of surrounding communities and hurt all of our pocketbooks,” Michael Hiatt, deputy managing attorney with Earthjustice’s Rocky Mountain Office, said in a news release. “This unlawful order will benefit no one but the struggling coal industry. We are prepared to take action to defend Colorado communities and ensure a just transition.”",https://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Climate_Coal_Town_Transition_91724.jpg?w=1024&h=683,N,,2025-12-31 15:13:11.477694

Arizona's biggest climate wins in 2025 The year wasn't all dust and smoke plumes and dead energy projects in Arizona.","Wildfires and extreme weather events in 2025 highlighted Arizona's vulnerability to climate change.

The state's clean energy industry faced setbacks, as major projects were downsized, delayed or canceled.

Despite federal policy shifts, Arizona saw a decrease in heat-related deaths and local progress in climate resilience efforts.

Anyone paying attention to climate news in 2025 had to buckle up and hold on.

In January of what meteorologists say will end as the second- or third-hottest year on record globally, the new U.S. presidential administration change marked a dramatic shift away from outgoing President Joe Biden's historic climate initiatives.

On his first day back in office, President Donald Trump signed executive orders redefining energy reserves as primarily fossil fuels, calling for more oil to be ""unleashed,"" withdrawing America from the United Nations' Paris Agreement to address climate change and halting permits and incentives for wind and solar projects. The consensus from scientists and economists is that these renewable energy technologies are not only the best way to slow atmospheric warming, caused most by burning fossil fuels, but are are increasingly the most profitable electricity option across the globe.

As Trump signed these orders reversing what had been this country's most significant steps toward slowing weather destabilization, neighborhoods across Los Angeles were burning to the ground in what a scientist told The Arizona Republic were, in part, ""climate change fires.""

In the months that followed, historical climate and environment data that had been collected by federal agencies and paid for by the American people steadily disappeared from government websites while the nation's scientific leadership, systems of pollution regulation and federal agencies managing public lands and the environment were all dramatically defunded, challenged or reshaped.

The year ended with the Trump administration ordering (some argue illegally) more polluting coal plants slated for closure to remain open, and by halting progress on five major offshore wind power projects well underway despite declaring a national energy emergency (a judge determined his attacks on wind power were also unlawful). December brought a decision to shut down a major climate research center in Colorado, and the advancement of plans to weaken the Endangered Species Act, the nation's strongest protection for species feeling the effects of climate change.

Arizona's biggest climate losses in 2025

These anti-climate-action actions from Trump's White House trickled down to influence the economy and livability of America's hottest big city and one of its driest and sunniest states.

Arizona's burgeoning clean energy industry retreated into the shadows in 2025 amid new uncertainty about federal financial support; six major projects set to employ more than 8,000 people were ultimately downsized, delayed or canceled. Among these were the massive KORE Power Gigafactory and the Meyer Burger solar panel assembly facility.

Experts told The Republic in January that with its ample sunshine and critical minerals, but lacking oil reserves, Arizona stood to lose more than most states from cuts to incentives for renewables projects and electric vehicle charging stations. This prediction seemed to manifest in July when proposed slashes to climate incentives in Trump's Big Beautiful Bill Act led to Arizona's emissions-reducing businesses going silent as companies huddled to calculate the viability of their investments and economic plans.

""Arbitrarily deciding to stop funding things (the government) already committed to funding...is not a cohesive strategy,"" a industry insider source, who asked to remain anonymous out of fear of retribution by the Trump administration, told The Republic.

Clean energy in Arizona may face additional headwinds from a 2025 Trump administration proposal to declassify climate pollution as a harm to human health, and by a controversial bill signed into law by Gov. Katie Hobbs that environmentalists say will make it easier to finance the replacement of coal plants with gas projects over renewables. Another bill introduced in the Arizona Legislature seemed to pick up Trump's anti-wind mantle. It would have made 90% of the state off limits to new wind power projects. It failed, but could resurface in 2026.

Over the summer, Trump also announced cuts to longstanding low-income utility assistance while, paradoxically, claiming energy shortages necessitated increased drilling. Arizona analysts warned that stalling clean energy progress would cause electricity prices to go up in the state, which has lead to an increase in indoor heat deaths. The year ended with major utility Arizona Public Service requesting a $579 million rate increase.

The Grand Canyon State's federal workforce was also downsized this year, just before Arizonans watched the North Rim of their most famous landmark burn in July. According to a new year-end report from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the U.S. Forest Service lost 16% of its staff in just the first half of 2025, confirming earlier reports that thousands of firefighting positions sat unfilled in the months before the Grand Canyon filled with smoke. That included 451 local jobs, or 20% of the department's Arizona-based staff.

Public lands in Arizona also faced proposals in 2025 to defund federal management at national parks, to increase cattle grazing permits on arid landscapes that studies have found are already overgrazed, to remove conservation as a valid land management use and to repeal a 2001 law prohibiting road construction through wild landscapes. Combining those threats with repeated attempts in Congress to make it easier to sell off public lands, including 14 million acres in Arizona, and recent legal rulings that pave the way for destructive mining and development of sacred Indigenous spaces — and treasured natural spaces in Arizona have never been more at risk.

Arizona scientists determined that the two megafires north of the Grand Canyon, which together consumed 200,000 acres of forest and forced the closure of trails and businesses nearby, would not have been as extreme without the warming, drying influences of climate change. Yet, just a few months earlier, the experts who had been selected from the state to contribute to the Sixth National Climate Assessment, a congressionally mandated report that updates knowledge on domestic threats and solutions related to climate change every few years, received an abrupt email from the Trump administration informing them that their voluntary services would no longer be needed.

Dave White, a professor at Arizona State University and director of its Global Institute of Sustainability and Innovation, viewed his participation as a lead author of the Fifth National Climate Assessment, published in late 2023, as a ""patriotic responsibility"" that he was ""incredibly proud of."" The Trump administration labeled these evidence-based reports as ""climate alarmism,"" a move White called ""deeply worrying"" in a society that has been successfully built on trust in science.

""It's incumbent upon us to call out the reality behind the rhetoric here,"" White told The Republic in April.

Other Arizona-based scientists watched as hard-won grants to fund environmental research were put on indefinite pause this year, while seasonal windows to collect data passed and international collaboration opportunities dried up.

Ted Schuur, a professor at Northern Arizona University who conducts far-flung ecosystem research with scientists from Canada, Germany and Denmark told The Republic that this absence from global work toward climate knowledge and solutions will not only result in worse heat and drought extremes across Arizona, but likely also the end of many economic and status benefits America has enjoyed as a research leader.

""What's changing in the Arctic is directly linked to global changes and heat temperature records in Phoenix. If we care about our kids and grandkids and future generations, this doubling down on fossil fuel use that we know is the wrong direction is not a good path,"" Schuur said. ""I personally am a carbon cycle scientist because I want to help make a difference.""

Scientists everywhere remain adamant that the difference between pursuing climate solutions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions now and leaving it until later will be vast. Cancelling climate reports, defunding firefighting and pulling the rug out from under clean energy projects may temporarily hide the problem from central view, like an ostrich burying its head from danger but leaving its body exposed.

But in 2025, Arizonans weathered broken heat records and a range of dramatic and expensive storms made worse by an overheated, destabilized atmosphere that showcased why climate avoidance is not an America-first strategy.

Before the ashes at the Grand Canyon had fully cooled, for example, unexpected flooding in Mohave and Gila counties inflicted $30 million in damage, which the Trump administration recently declined to help with through federal emergency management funding. What had been an exceptionally dry and inactive summer monsoon suddenly darkened the skies around Phoenix in an immense August rainstorm and haboob dust cloud. Then, air turned abruptly cold as a hail storm shocked typically warm parts of the state.

The year closed with a holiday season in the mountains that brought rain instead of snow and temperatures 20 degrees warmer than average. It also ended with Phoenix climate activists mourning the death of 80-year-old Hazel Chandler, who spent her life fighting for cleaner air and a more stable climate on behalf of future generations.

Arizona's biggest climate wins in 2025

The year wasn't all dust and smoke plumes and dead energy projects in Arizona. Locally, some rays of hopeful climate news snuck through in 2025.

Perhaps most importantly, this year was less fatal when it comes to climate-fueled extreme heat. Arizona's most populous county is poised to record a notable dip in annual heat-related deaths in 2025 for the first time in a decade.

This may be thanks in part to Governor Katie Hobbs' Office of Resiliency, which successfully pushed back on the Trump administration pulling support for home efficiency improvements, and implemented a statewide heat preparedness plan. A three-part Arizona Republic investigation of the plan's effectiveness determined it made strides in rural heat coordination and deployment of mobile cooling units, even as its leading agency dropped the ball on addressing heat-related hospitalizations and its authors declined to acknowledge the influences of climate change.

In contrast to gubernatorial avoidance of climate talk, Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallego countered national climate dismissal head on by stepping in to lead on municipal action as the 2025 chair of Climate Mayors. She also introduced restrictions and sustainability considerations for new data centers, which environmentalists view as wasteful of water and energy — a critical developing climate story for 2026. Offsetting that was Gallego's support for the massive semiconductor plant TSMC and her desire to make Phoenix a hub for tech manufacturing, which also places large demands on limited local water supplies and forces more polluting electricity production.

In 2025, the city made progress on climate-related goals by launching the ""Phoenix Brownfields Revolving Loan Fund"" to revitalize degraded land, by approving a new ""Energy Access Plan"" to expand cooling affordability and by opening the region's first 24/7 heat respite center.

“Phoenix is proving that bold action and creative solutions can make a real difference in the fight against climate challenges,"" Gallego told The Republic in a statement. ""From planting over a thousand trees and expanding shade through innovative art installations, to advancing solar energy, water purification and food resilience programs, we are building a city prepared for the future.""

Dave Hondula, a climate scientist who oversees Phoenix's Office of Heat Response and Mitigation, celebrated reaching 31 of 36 year-one milestones in the city's five-year ""Shade Phoenix Plan"" to help keep residents safe and cool.

“Increasing tree and shade coverage throughout Phoenix, especially in areas where it is severely lacking, is one of our best strategies to build resilience to climate challenges,” Hondula wrote to The Republic.

Although thousands of acres of shade went up in smoke at the Grand Canyon this summer, scientists issued hopeful predictions that wildlife may recover fairly well given the open, fire-adapted landscape that likely allowed them to escape the flames and then return. (At the other end of the state, however, wildlife face new obstacles with the now double-layered border wall.) Many humans looking for habitat at the North Rim will be glad to watch a lodge to replace the historic burned structure take shape. Some Arizonans fear increasing winter access to the North Rim will detract from the backcountry experience, but business owners in the region told The Republic the planned reconstruction will ""be a huge benefit to everybody in the area,” perhaps even better than before.

Tragic as it was, watching both Los Angeles and the Grand Canyon burn in 2025 may help keep Arizonans on the path of getting serious about wildfire prevention. While L.A. officials moved to cut corners on fire-resistant building practices in the aftermath of the January flames under pressure from homeowners to allow them to quickly rebuild, an Arizona Republic investigation of how this state's forested cities are taking action to prevent conflagrations found many to be reasonably prepared.

From a forester launching a tree thinning consulting business in Flagstaff in response to demand for ""Firewise"" development to the town of Pinetop-Lakeside approving a $11.6 million bond for a new wildland fire station, Arizonans are taking fire management in the age of climate change seriously.

""There are 177 communities, self-defined, active in the (Firewise) program (in Arizona),"" Michele Steinberg, wildfire division director at the National Fire Protection Association, told The Republic in April. ""And that's growing all the time.""

Support among western nature lovers for conservation also seemed to grow in 2025, despite (or perhaps because of) unending attempts in Washington D.C. to erode environmental protections and put public lands up for sale. In the face of a clear development agenda, a slew of Arizonans stood tall for the cause.

Although Arizona State University didn't immediately step up to the plate when Trump went after university funding and any research project that included the word ""diversity,"" it did eventually bet big and publicly on an eco-friendly future. Early in fall semester, the massive university known for its focus on sustainability announced that a $115 million donation would fund a new School of Conservation Futures, giving hope in the dark to Arizona lands, species and young environmentalists.

""There is an urgent need to tackle the challenges facing our planet, as well as an unbelievable opportunity to find new solutions by dedicating our time, creativity and resources to the task,” ASU President Michael Crow told The Republic in September.

Other leaders of all ages continue to inspire other Arizonans to keep climate hopes alive. This year marked the 50th anniversary of the publication of Edward Abbey's ""The Monkey Wrench Gang,"" which continues to seed young minds with ideas for environmental revolution in the Southwest.

More contemporary local leaders like Phoenix organizer and entrepreneur Rhonda Bannard and Prescott naturalist and professor Thomas Fleischner are assembling groups of women or students, respectively, for instruction on how to be environmental advocates and appreciators.

Further into the wilderness, Roz Switzer and Emily Matyas spent 2025 gathering ""Old Broads"" to howl in support of wild animals. And following in their footsteps, Tucson computer whiz and youth climate pioneer Ojas Sanghi is poised to help harness artificial intelligence not to use more electricity but to use it cleaner. (These individuals were all profiled in The Republic this year as part of our monthly local climate leader series. You can nominate someone using this form: https://forms.gle/QCCxBPSHGy1bUJQ99.)

Finally, in a year that saw a distressing number of major news outlets dismiss their climate reporters just as scientists say this coverage is more important than ever, The Republic, Arizona's largest newspaper, still employs one of the biggest local climate and environmental journalism teams in the nation. For people relying on fact-checked, locally-contextualized news tracking the causes and consequences of climate change's influence in the state, that may be a win worth celebrating.

Adjusting your thermostat a few degrees when you’re not home can also reduce energy use and save money.
Eating healthier and wasting less Cutting down food waste can also benefit your wallet, your diet and the environment.
Food waste costs U.S. consumers $728 every year, according to the Environmental Protection Agency, and generates the annual planet-warming greenhouse gases equivalent to 42 coal-fired power plants.
“You’ll improve your diet, you’ll reduce your waste and your food will come in less contact with plastic,” she said.","Here’s some good news as the holidays wrap up: Many New Year’s resolutions people already make — eating healthier, saving money, getting organized — double as climate-friendly habits.

Whether you want to spend less, declutter or eat right, here are a few choices that could make a difference for you and the climate. Bonus: They’re all low-effort and low-cost.

Saving money on bills

If you want to save money, start at home. Electronics and appliances can continue drawing power even when they’re turned off. You can cut phantom energy use by unplugging items you’re not using, such as chargers and entertainment systems or using a power strip with an on-off switch.

Adjusting your thermostat a few degrees when you’re not home can also reduce energy use and save money. The U.S. Department of Energy says that adjusting your thermostat by 7-10 degrees Fahrenheit (4-6 degrees Celsius) for eight hours a day can save up to 10% a year on heating and cooling.

Another simple tip: Washing your clothes on the cold setting and air-drying them when possible can help lower energy use and utility costs. Heating water is the biggest energy draw in laundry, and clothes dryers are among the most energy-intensive household appliances, said Matthew Gonzales, the vice chairman of the National Hispanic Energy Council, which advocates for affordable energy for communities of color. This can also reduce wear and tear on clothing.

Gonzales said other simple swaps include switching to LED bulbs, sealing drafty windows and replacing dirty air filters so heating and cooling systems run more efficiently. He also suggested using natural light during the day, opening or closing curtains and windows strategically to manage heat and turning off the lights when you don’t need them.

Savings vary widely depending on where someone lives, how old their home is and local energy prices. But he said households in high-cost states can see meaningful savings from small changes over time.

“Don’t let perfect be the enemy of good enough,” Gonzales said.

Eating healthier and wasting less

Cutting down food waste can also benefit your wallet, your diet and the environment.

Food waste costs U.S. consumers $728 every year, according to the Environmental Protection Agency, and generates the annual planet-warming greenhouse gases equivalent to 42 coal-fired power plants.

One place to start is by using what you already have in your pantry before hitting the grocery store, said cookbook author Anne-Marie Bonneau.

“If you have fat and an onion and a couple of random vegetables — or even one random vegetable or some leftover cooked proteins or grains — you’ve got soup in the making,” Bonneau said. “If you’ve cleared out so much food that you don’t even have an onion and fat, it’s probably time to go shopping.”

She also recommends preserving food before it spoils, including fermenting vegetables, which, she says, is easier than it seems. For example, you can make sauerkraut with just cabbage, salt and a glass jar. You can also make sauces from seasonal vegetables like tomatoes and freeze them for use later in the year.

Using a multicooker to make things like apple sauce, yogurt, stews and beans can also help with meal prep while reducing energy use.

As a general rule, Bonneau added, eating fewer ultra-processed foods — such as sugary cereals, hot dogs, chicken nuggets and TV dinners — can benefit both your health and the environment. Those foods are often heavily packaged in plastic, which can shed into food and contribute to pollution.

“You’ll improve your diet, you’ll reduce your waste and your food will come in less contact with plastic,” she said.

Decluttering and buying less

Getting organized doesn’t have to mean buying storage bins or throwing things out. Often, it starts with using what you already have.

Spending even an hour organizing your space, spotting duplicates and rediscovering forgotten items can reduce impulse spending by helping people understand what they actually use, said Katrina Caspelich, communications director for Remake, an advocacy group for human rights and climate justice in fashion.

She said a “one-in, one-out” rule — where you can only buy a new thing if it replaces an old thing — can be effective because it keeps wardrobes from growing and helps prevent clutter by encouraging more intentional purchases.

Unsubscribing from brand emails and sale alerts can also help. “Most impulse purchases start with a notification, not a need,” Caspelich said, adding that waiting 24 hours before buying something new often turns a “must-have” into a pass.

For a more structured reset, you might try a no-buy challenge, pausing new purchases for 30 or 90 days while re-wearing, repairing, swapping with friends, or, if you can't commit to buying nothing, shopping secondhand instead of new. “The key is flexibility,” she said. “Framing it as an experiment rather than a strict rule makes it feel empowering instead of restrictive.”

Remake estimates that someone who takes part in a 90-day no new clothes challenge can save about 3,900 liters (1,030 gallons) of water, avoid roughly 300 kilograms (about 661 pounds) of carbon dioxide emissions, and keep around 9 kilograms (about 20 pounds) of clothing waste out of landfills while saving an average of nearly $300 by pausing new purchases.

Zoom out and the scale becomes clearer: Americans generated about 17 million tons of textile waste in 2018, most of it clothing, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.

For anyone overwhelmed by the advice, the takeaway is simple: You don’t have to do everything, and you don’t have to do it perfectly. Starting with one habit you’ll actually keep can make a difference for your budget, your routine and the climate.

A look at the global natural gas and LNG markets by the numbers

109.13 Mt/y: U.S. LNG exports are set to meet a new all time yearly high in 2025, growing more than 25% year/year, according to Kpler predictive data. Export volumes from the United States are expected to reach at least 109.13 million tons (Mt/y), by the end of the calendar year. The commissioning of Plaquemines LNG added an additional 16.51 Mt in exports, but existing terminals also saw yearly gains. Corpus Christi LNG shipped an additional 2 Mt/y due to the ramp up of the Stage 3 expansion. Freeport LNG also saw a 3.21 Mt/y gain after repair and maintenance work.

$9.66/MMBtu: Global benchmark natural gas prices are ending the year at levels last seen before the 2022 invasion of Ukraine. As seasonal temperatures turn toward the milder side in Europe, the February Title Transfer Facility contract has sunk to around $9.66 by mid-week. This is despite European Union gas storage levels falling below the five-year average for most of December. East Asia has maintained the price premium, but it has declined to similar levels as demand softens in Japan and South Korea.

19 Bcf/d: Pipeline nominations to U.S. LNG terminals have held steady near 19 Bcf/d for most of the week, helping to lift Henry Hub near the $4 mark. LNG feed gas nominations have previously hit 19 Bcf/d during the month as projects continue to reach advanced commissioning stages, but pushed to new highs consistently since the Christmas holiday. Nominations have been driven by Plaquemines LNG pulling above operational capacity and an uptick at Sabine Pass LNG.

460 Bcf/y: ST LNG LLC has asked the U.S. Department of Energy to approve exports for a proposed 8.4 Mt/y capacity project offshore the Texas coast. Project partners requested approval of 460 Bcf/y in LNG exports from the Matagorda, TX site through 2050. The project is outlined to utilize up to four floating LNG units combined with a floating storage unit, anchored equipment and a three-mile lateral pipeline to connect to existing offshore infrastructure. The terminal would be supplied feed gas by the Katy and Tres Palacios supply hubs. First LNG production is targeted to begin in 2029, if approved.

Conclusion The confluence of rising electrification (and AIdriven demand), FEOC and tariff-driven regulatory complexity, and an active private capital market has reshaped the bankability equation for power projects.","The US energy policy landscape underwent a significant shift in 2025 with the enactment of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act and issuance of related executive orders.

At the same time as the energy industry is adjusting to the new administration in the White House, demand for electricity in the US is expected to trend upwards after nearly two decades of being relatively flat1 ,driven by the data centre buildout, electrification and the onshoring of manufacturing. While the policy shift has created headwinds and bankability issues for renewables developers, demand for renewables projects is expected to continue to grow with the continued load growth spurred by data centres and electrification. Demand concerns and the need for energy reliability have also triggered a resurgence of interest in conventional energy and baseload power generation.

The demand squeeze

The International Energy Agency predicts around 40% growth in global demand for electricity by 2035, driven in part by advanced manufacturing, electric mobility and data centres.2 Electricity demand in the US is expected to increase dramatically as well, after nearly two decades of flat growth, driving an expansion in generating and storage capacity.3 Meanwhile, interconnection delays, which have been plaguing the US energy industry, have continued, and shortages of key equipment have become more pronounced.

Retail electricity prices in the US have already been increasing, in part a result of capacity prices increasing for regional transmission organisations (RTOs), which must contract for that capacity with generators. As the project costs for new build increase for developers, the cost to RTOs for that capacity has begun to climb accordingly – and in some cases dramatically, as reflected in a 22% increase in PJM capacity prices during 2025.4

Local distribution utilities and other load serving entities will ultimately pass those higher prices onto retail consumers in the form of higher electricity prices.5 This has prompted stakeholders in the industry to think creatively about ways to more efficiently bring large loads online, although ready solutions remain elusive, as evidenced by PJM's launch, and then abandonment, of a proposal to fast-track large loads such as data centres through mandatory curtailment.6

The regulatory squeeze

The July 2025 enactment of the OBBBA accelerates the phase-out of the tax credit incentives for solar and wind projects and electric vehicles. Under the OBBBA, solar and wind projects must begin construction within 12 months of enactment, ie by July 4 2026, or be placed in service by December 31 2027 to qualify for tax credits.

Additionally, the OBBBA broadened the scope of the foreign entities of concern (FEOC) restrictions, which apply to projects that begin construction after December 31 2025.

FEOC rules bar projects from claiming cleanenergy tax credits if they are owned by, controlled by, or receive material assistance from entities tied to specified foreign nations or designated as security concerns. Internal Revenue Service guidance for the implementation of expanded FEOC restrictions under the OBBBA has not yet been released, adding to the uncertainty around the availability of tax credits for projects that begin construction after December 31 2025.

Such uncertainty, coupled with the accelerated phaseout of the tax credits, has led the developers to reprioritise their development pipeline for solar projects and rush to begin construction by the end of 2025.

Tariffs add an additional layer of uncertainty. Even where projects are not directly affected by FEOC provisions, tariffs on imported modules, inverters or battery cells remain a meaningful line-item risk: sudden duties can raise equipment costs, delay deliveries, or make supply chains uneconomical.

The current administration has taken other steps that are expected to impede new solar and wind development. In January 2025, the federal government paused permitting and approval of new offshore wind projects in federal waters.7

On July 7 2025, the president issued an executive order titled ""Ending Market Distorting Subsidies for Unreliable, Foreign-Controlled Energy Sources"", which sought to review regulations and policies in order to cease preferential treatment of solar and wind facilities.8

On July 15 2025, the Department of the Interior issued a memorandum implementing that executive order. The memorandum imposed additional layers of review – including final review by the office of the secretary – for all decisions, actions, consultations, and other undertakings related to wind and solar energy facilities.9 Such additional review is likely to have a dilatory effect on the issuance of permits for solar and wind projects on federal lands, but may be required for projects outside of federal lands as well.10

Renewable project bankability

Regulatory shift and tariff uncertainty have raised certain issues relating to change-in-law provisions, FEOC compliance and tax credit eligibility, which are putting pressure on project bankability and in some cases pushing sponsors to be on-risk for potential additional capital requirements.

Negotiations have increased around the scope of changes in tax law, with lenders reintroducing the absence of changes in proposed tax law as a condition to funding in debt documents. Developers, offtakers, and suppliers of equipment also have extensively negotiated change-in-law provisions in commercial contracts.

In many cases, the risk of increased costs due to new tariffs has been at least partially shifted from suppliers to developers given the uncertainty around tariff policy. Some offtakers have agreed to price adjustments due to increases in tariffs, but many offtakers still refuse to accept such risk. While project finance has always relied on structured allocation of construction risk, with tariffs and supply-chain volatility, some lenders have required guarantees from sponsors to cover related cost overruns.

In the absence of clear IRS guidelines about FEOC restrictions, financings that bridge tax equity investments or tax credit transfers have required borrowers to provide representations, warranties and covenants concerning FEOC compliance.

In addition, loans made by lenders who themselves are ineligible for tax credits under the FEOC rules can cause borrowers to be ineligible for tax credits. Accordingly, in certain circumstances, borrowers are asking lenders to provide representations and warranties regarding their status under the FEOC rules (namely that they are not ""specified foreign entities"").

The practical consequences are that both borrowers and lenders are engaging in legal due diligence and requiring each other to provide contractual protections. Following the release of IRS guidance, fact-based diligence may become more prevalent (as opposed to relying on legal conclusions as to a party's status under the FEOC rules in representations and warranties).

In many cases, the risk of increased costs due to new tariffs has been at least partially shifted from suppliers to developers given the uncertainty around tariff policy

Certainly as to eligibility for tax credits, the July 4 2026 and December 31 2027 cliffs under the OBBBA are likely to impact the availability of bridge financing sized against expected tax equity or tax credit transfers. Since lenders will require a buffer period in advance of those cliffs, sufficient to take remedial action to procure such investment (in the absence of a developer successfully procuring the same), the tightening of available debt capital, and potentially requirements for related sponsor guarantees, should begin to impact project timelines and economics well in advance of those dates.

Private credit

While the demand for funding power generating projects has been growing amidst the growth of regulatory and policy risks, private credit has surged into the power and renewables space, offering flexible debt products that can bridge gaps left by constrained commercial banks.

Private credit lenders can offer patient capital, underwriting to hold their loans, even through temporary extrinsic market challenges; sector-focused capabilities to diligence and structure for complex projects; a willingness to accept construction period complexity, and apply creative structures such as delayed-draw borrowing base facilities for project development costs or quasi-equity instruments that can sit alongside tax equity; and a conviction to close amidst volatility, which derives from each of the factors above. Especially during a period of market uncertainty, private credit's conviction to execute will continue to make such lenders an attractive source of capital.

However, private credit funds still require strong structural protections – covenant packages, security interests, and strict change-in-law notice/cure regimes – and private credit may not fill every gap. Particularly for projects that remain reliant upon tax equity or tax credit transfers to drive a meaningful portion of projects' cash equity returns, permanent tax attributes will remain their primary economic driver.

Near-term outlook

Renewable power –We anticipate a growing divide in the coming year between renewable power developers. On the one hand, well-capitalised and experienced renewables developers that own projects with clean, FEOC-compliant supply lines and robust offtake arrangements will continue to attract financing at competitive pricing. Hybrid solar plus longer-duration storage projects, which serve both capacity and firming needs, should be particularly bankable.

Further, given the increasing cost-competitiveness of renewable power and rising demand for electricity, which is driving up offtake prices, a smaller but growing number of renewables projects may have long-term viability even without tax credits. Indeed, projects that forego tax credits may have greater access to cheaper equipment, since those projects will not be required to comply with the FEOC restrictions. As offtake agreements are priced up, there will also be further opportunities for project financing to fill the gap left by tax equity

There is likely to be some consolidation in the market, in favour of well-capitalised developers and their sponsors, particularly those whose pipelines of projects are supported by economics that are less reliant on tax credits.

On the other hand, marginal projects that depend on uncertain imports, thin margins or speculative merchant risk will face higher financing costs or fail to reach financial close. For projects for which sufficient economic capital is no longer expected to be available given the project's timeline, and which are unable to reprice, those may be marked down or sold, leading to opportunities for selective acquisitions. There is likely to be some consolidation in the market, in favour of well-capitalised developers and their sponsors, particularly those whose pipelines of projects are supported by economics that are less reliant on tax credits.

Conventional power – There is a near-term resurgence of interest in dispatchable resources – eg, fast-start gas peakers, combined-cycle plants with hydrogen readiness – that can integrate with renewables to meet the load profile associated with large-load data centres, as well as other clean fuel sources such as geothermal and nuclear. Some lenders and offtakers find conventional capacity easier to underwrite because it avoids the uncertainty and complexity of tax credits and FEOC compliance. However, conventional projects must still face decarbonisation politics, potential future carbon pricing, and stringent environmental permitting – all factors that complicate long-dated financing.

Moreover, due to a worldwide shortage of natural gas turbines, wait times for large turbines are now often five years or more, with major manufacturers still hesitant to add new manufacturing capacity.11

That shortage compromises the ability of natural gas projects to serve the immediate demand for electricity, in particular for data centres that highly prioritize ""speed to power"". The shortage may pose a significant constraint on the ability of gas-fired projects to achieve viability and secure financing. In fact, we already see a growing interest among data centre developers in installing reciprocating engines or smaller, mobile gas generators behind the meter, often as a stopgap solution until utility-scale gas generation and/or grid connection is available.

Conclusion

The confluence of rising electrification (and AIdriven demand), FEOC and tariff-driven regulatory complexity, and an active private capital market has reshaped the bankability equation for power projects.

The winners will be project developers who can align disciplined supply-chain management and FEOC compliance, or invest forward into new baseload opportunities, with flexible financing solutions, leaning on private credit where appropriate, while protecting their core economics through thoughtful contractual drafting.

The order from Energy Secretary Chris Wright will keep the nearly 50-year-old Craig Generating Station Unit 1 in northwest Colorado operating until the end of March, with an option to extend it further.

It’s the Department of Energy’s sixth such move this year; Wright has also ordered two coal plants in Indiana, one in Michigan and one in Washington state to stay open past their retirement dates, as well as a Pennsylvania power plant that runs on oil.

“Keeping this coal plant online will ensure Americans maintain an affordable, reliable, and secure supply of electricity,” Wright said in a statement.

Colorado’s governor and its top energy official pushed back on Wright’s claim that keeping Craig open would boost affordability, saying it would only raise electricity prices.

In a statement, Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, a Democrat, said the order would pass “tens of millions in costs to Colorado ratepayers, in order to keep a coal plant open that is broken and not needed.”

According to Polis’ statement, Craig 1 “isn’t even operational right now” and would require repairs costing millions of dollars to get it up and running before it could even produce power. Tri-State Generation and Transmission Association, the power supply co-op that owns Craig 1, said the unit has been offline since a critical part broke on December 19.

“As a not-for-profit cooperative, our membership will bear the costs of compliance with this order unless we can identify a method to share costs with those in the region,” said Tri-State CEO Duane Highley.

It would cost at least $20 million to keep Craig 1 operational for 90 days and approximately $85 million to run the unit for a year, according to a report from power sector consulting firm Grid Strategies, prepared for the Sierra Club. Those costs are mostly from the purchase of coal. However, the price tag could balloon to $150 million per year, depending on how much the DOE requires the plant to run, the Grid Strategies report said.

Colorado Energy Office executive director Will Toor said Tri-State has already built gas and renewables projects to replace the power the unit produced. Toor said the North American Electric Reliability Corporation has not forecast any reliability risks in the region.

In other words, Toor said, Craig 1 is simply not needed to bolster the state’s grid.

“We think there would be a very significant cost to ratepayers for no benefit,” Toor told CNN.

In addition, Toor said, Craig 1 was built near a coal seam that has had all of its coal mined. Procuring more coal from elsewhere would incur additional costs.

Wright’s order “is purely for the purpose of trying to keep coal in the system for ideological reasons, while driving up cost to customers,” Toor said. “At the same time, they are actually taking steps to reduce the reliability of the grid by making it far harder to deploy the resources that you can quickly build, which are wind and solar.”

Keeping other coal plants open past their retirement dates has foisted tens of millions of additional costs on ratepayers.

Consumers Energy, the utility running a retiring Michigan coal plant that Wright forced to stay open in June, recently reported that it cost $80 million to keep the plant open from late May to late September — largely from the purchase of additional coal — which will raise residential electricity bills in Michigan and 10 other states the plant serves.

Environmental groups are challenging the other orders from Wright in the courts.

IN THE FOREFRONT

Stanly County Airport in New London, north of county seat Albermarle, is one of the state’s 62 general aviation airports. Its 12,000-square-foot terminal, which was built in 2010, has two conference rooms, passenger waiting area with fireplace and wide-screen television. The airport also has rentable hangers, a flight training flight training school and sight-seeing flights. But something different took off there in October, when a ribbing-cutting ceremony opened Phase 1 of North Carolina Emergency Training Center.

NCETC plans were announced in 2017. Gov. Roy Cooper signed a budget four years later that dedicated the first $28 million toward its construction, including a state-of-the-art aircraft rescue and firefighting crash simulator. State Fire Marshall Brian Taylor has been the key player in working with state leaders to bring the project to fruition, says Mark Tyler, chief operating officer of the Office of State Fire Marshall. “He’s been very instrumental in making this happen,” he says. The state has committed $87 million to the project so far.

NCETC provides world-class training for firefighters, law enforcement officers, emergency management personnel and members of the military. The center hosts a variety of courses, including Swift Water Rescue, Aircraft Firefighting, Urban Search and Rescue, Hazardous Materials Response and Fire Investigation Technician. About 275 people attending the opening, when they witnessed demonstrations of aircraft rescue burns, jet fuel burns, and swift water boat and helicopter rescues. “This is a statewide facility for anyone in the fire services and rescue services in the state,” Tyler says. “We’re close to getting water capabilities, and we will have national and international interest.”

The water sector, expected to be complete in January, simulates events emergency workers encounter during floods and hurricanes. “There are three primary components,” Tyler says. “[First is] a self-contained water facility, where there’s a big lake, where all the water is stored, then we have massive pumps that pump it into a swift water channel, like the Whitewater Center. And we have a third component, an urban flood village. We open the water into an urban streetscape, like we’re doing rescue work in a small town. We also have boat operators on the lake who train in various components and an environment where we can simulate flooding like a river.”

NCETC’s Phase 2 is planned, and it will add to the center’s economic impact. Dormitories and a cafeteria will be built across the street from the airport. It’s expected to be complete at the end of the year. “People come from all over the nation to train,” Kazimir says. “The center is gigantic, about double the size of the Whitewater Center in Charlotte, but it isn’t for tourists. It’s just for training.”

IN THE CLASSROOM

Stanly Community College’s newest asset, the 31,600-square-foot Trades Facility, opened in October. “It’s exclusively for trades and revolutionary for our economic development efforts,” Kazimir says. “Not only can we show companies the building, but we can build a curriculum for them. We’re at a definite advantage over some other places in the state, because there’s talk like there will be a workforce deficit that will hit when our trade forces retire in the next five years, and we’re trying to get ahead of that.”

Named the Brown Building in honor of longtime SCC contributor Richard Lane Brown, the $12 million investment expands SCC’s programs in electrical line work, welding, mechatronics engineering, heavy equipment operations, computer-integrated machining, and air-conditioning, heating and refrigeration. Its new programs include plumbing, electric systems technology and building construction technology.

While many employment sectors are drifting toward artificial intelligence, Parsons says the hands-on skills taught in the Brown Building are timeless. It now has about 150 students, a third of whom are Career and College Promise high school students. “We have an employer advisory board, and one of the things we’ve encouraged all our programs to do is ask, ‘How do you see AI changing the workforce? How are your entry-level employees going to be different three, five years into the future?’” he says. “And we re-evaluate the skills we’re teaching and the skills they need. At the same time, parallel to that is for our students to leave here with a sense of reality and critical thinking and the ability to communicate. We need to incorporate reliability and dependability into the curriculum, because those are the students who will be successful.”

Parsons says AI won’t be the boss. “I think AI will change some jobs, but there’s an aspect of creativity that AI can’t do,” he says. “AI may take care of some repetitive tasks, but that means the skill level has to go up. For example, AI might help an HVAC worker troubleshoot, but they still have to verify what AI says. That level of critical thinking will have to go up, because AI does make mistakes. We work very closely with the [Stanly County] Economic Development Commission and oftentimes have a seat at the table when companies are having a look at the city. We also have meetings in our new facility. And it’s been very beneficial.”

When business officials tour the Brown Building, they find that “skilled trades” isn’t the same visual as in the past. “We’ve been very excited with the reaction,” Parsons says. “It’s a great facility to change the narrative of what skilled trades looks like. It’s not dirty and nasty. The equipment we have is top-notch. So is the faculty. You can have great buildings and great equipment, but unless you have a great staff, you don’t accomplish much.”

Parsons also emphasizes SCC’s Small Business Center. “It helps aspiring entrepreneurs with tasks like writing a business plan and finding resources for marketing, whatever they need to get started,” he says. “So, we encourage our trade students, like those who may want to run their own HVAC company or their own heavy equipment and grading company … to take advantage of the Small Business Center and get some experience.”

Misenheimer-based Pfeiffer University opened a Charlotte campus in 1977 and a Raleigh-Durham campus in 2004. It is a private liberal arts institution affiliated with the United Methodist Church and accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges. In 2020, it opened its $18 million Center for Health Sciences in Albemarle, where students study in the Master of Physician Assistant Studies and Master of Science in Occupational Therapy programs. “Pfeiffer’s presence is promoting expansion of the health science field in downtown Albemarle,” Kazimir says. “Also, we’re seeing a lot more foot traffic and vibrancy. Every time I’m in a coffee shop, there are young people in there studying or mingling.”

In October, while other in-state four-year schools were considering a 3% tuition increase for in-state undergraduate students, Pfeiffer announced itwould not raise its tuition. It said the move “underscores Pfeiffer’s enduring commitment to accessibility, affordability and high-quality education.”

Pfeiffer University President Scott Bullard says holding the line on tuition made sense. “We believe that a transformative, personalized education should remain within reach for every student,” he said in a news release. “By holding undergraduate tuition, fees and room rates steady for 2026-27, we are investing in our students’ futures and reaffirming our promise to keep Pfeiffer affordable without compromising excellence.”

IN DEMAND

Downtown Albemarle has been reinvented. No longer a stagnant textile town, it’s an emerging place for education, retail and affordable living. “Since the Health Sciences Center opened, downtown Albemarle has shifted from a quiet business district to a place with more life after hours,” says Lindsey Almond, the city’s economic development director. “Students, faculty and new residents are walking the sidewalks; monthly or weekly events draw people into the evening; the mix of uses is shifting toward ‘live-work-play’ rather than just 9-to-5. The adaptive reuse of historic buildings like the Albemarle Hotel and Lowder Hardware brings residents and demand for retail/restaurants.”

“The Residences at the Albemarle Hotel provide modern apartment living right in the heart of downtown, drawing new residents into the core and helping catalyze nearby retail and restaurants,” Almond says. “The building was redeveloped by Anchor & Pillar with 29 upscale apartments and a gorgeous restaurant-commercial space on the first floor. Like the Residences, [the Lowder building] is another key downtown conversion repurposed into high-end apartments with ground-floor commercial/retail — increasing the resident base downtown and adding demand for restaurants and stores after business hours.”

Downtown has a new Courthouse Plaza gathering spot, and an annual $90,000 Downtown Catalyst Grant, now in its fourth year, supports local downtown businesses with funds released up-front not as reimbursements. “The Catalyst Grant funds help make downtown more attractive and active, while the business park, Albemarle Business Center, is a regionally competitive site with large lot sizes, major infrastructure, proximity to Charlotte, ready utilities and a city that controls the site and is curating its tenant base.”

There’s baseball, too. “Three years ago, the city was ecstatic to announce that we were adding a collegiate wood-bat baseball team that is based in downtown Albemarle, the Uwharrie Wampus Cats,” Almond says. “From a downtown-vitality standpoint, having regular summer games, fireworks nights, such as on Independence Day, and associated events brings folks downtown in the evening, supporting bars, restaurants, retail and activity beyond the 9-to-5 day.” The team will be one of the six founding members of the Blue Ridge League this season.

IN THE FIELDS

The N.C. County Extension counts 649 farms in Stanly County. They cover 109,164 acres, which is 43.1% of the county. Most county farms, 299 of them, are in the 10- to 49-acre range, followed by 220 at 50 acres to 179 acres. Thirty-one are more than 1,000 acres.

Stanly County farms bring in their fair share of revenue, starting with what’s grown and raised. The market value of products sold in 2022 was more than $91 million; the net cash farm income was nearly $29 million. Top crops and livestock included cotton, wheat, cattle and turkeys.

Farming supports jobs in insurance, financing, equipment, marketing, food preparation and chemical distribution, in addition to farm labor, says County Extension Director Molly Alexi. “Farming is considered the county’s No. 1 industry and a vital economic driver, with top agricultural products including soybeans and chickens. The sector’s influence extends to the community by maintaining open space, preserving the county’s rural character and fostering a supportive local economy.”

Kazimir sees a priority in balancing rural and urban and land reserved for farms. “People elsewhere are losing farms, and that’s something we don’t want to ever happen to us,” she says. “What’s unique about us is we want to blend agriculture and businesses and grow the agriculture industry in our county as we grow. It’s our core identity. Agriculture is 100% now and forever will be our largest business in the county and the most-valued. We don’t ever want to get away from that.”

IN MANY ITINERARIES

Eastern Stanly County has 10,000 acres of lakes, Morrow Mountain State Park and Uwharrie National Forest, campgrounds and fishing holes, vineyards, golf courses, bike trails, parks and urban farms. All feed a flourishing tourism industry. VisitNC reports that visitors spent nearly $116 million in Stanly County in 2024; that’s $8 million more than the previous year. Of the state’s 100 counties, Stanly moved from 52nd to 50th in tourism spending in 2024.

Tourism is a group effort. “Visit Stanly, the Stanly County Convention and Visitors Bureau, partners with 10 municipalities, Stanly County and area attractions to promote visitors to come enjoy all the great activities and events held in each corner of the county,” says Kasey Brooks, director of Stanly County Convention and Visitors Bureau. “Visit Stanly works closely with the chamber of Commerce, Morrow Mountain State Park, hotels and attractions to encourage visitors to support the local businesses while in the county.”

Brooks says wedding venues, sporting events, restaurants, wineries, breweries, concerts and antique shops add to the list of visitor attractions. “Visit Stanly will continue to work to encourage visitors to come to Stanly County to enjoy our great natural beauty and perhaps stay a few days,” she says. ■",https://images.businessnc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/StanlyCounty_main_image_web.jpg,N,,2025-12-31 13:58:50.995252

SETTING A COURSE

The new year begins as the previous ended; the winds of change are blowing. From decisions made in Washington, D.C., to opinions served at kitchen tables in North Carolina’s smallest communities, there are plenty of voices wanting to be heard on a matching number of issues. That makes the work of advocates even more important. Business North Carolina recently gathered experts from the field to discuss what’s important to their groups and what that means to business and life in general across North Carolina, how they’re navigating these confusing seas and how to find common ground, where different viewpoints can row together. Their conversation was moderated by Publisher Ben Kinney. The transcript was edited for brevity and clarity.

The discussion was sponsored by:

• Electricities of North Carolina

• NC Chamber

• North Carolina Independent Colleges and Universities

• E&V Strategic Communications

HOW DOES YOUR GROUP AFFECT LIFE AND BUSINESS IN NORTH CAROLINA?

WILLIAMS: Most people are familiar with their local independent or private college or university. But they may not realize there are 36 across North Carolina. They have about 60,000 undergraduate students and about 25,000 graduate and professional students.

These schools award about 90% of the physician-assistant degrees in the state. If you’ve visited a doctor’s office lately, you likely saw a PA if you didn’t make an appointment three months earlier. So, they’re critical to delivering healthcare in the state. They also award about 65% of the law degrees, 60% of medical degrees and 56% of pharmacy degrees in the state.

Those efforts and others contribute to a great quality of life for our students, and they’re critical to employers. Business news channel CNBC named North Carolina its Top State for Business three of the past four years, and we want a four-peat. But that will require the proper workforce. It’s a double-edged advantage, not a sword. It transforms lives in North Carolina and meets employers’ needs. That supports strong economic development.

CASHION: NC Chamber supports North Carolina’s position as a top state for private-sector job growth. Our team advances policies that make it one of the world’s best places to do business. Those efforts create an environment that supports existing businesses and that economic developers can sell.

The Chamber has developed international relationships, including with business groups in Northern Ireland and Abu Dhabi. We recently signed agreements with the Mexican Business Council for Trade, Investment and Technology and ProColombia. We recently hosted a group from Invest in

Cartagena, part of our ProColombia effort. We toured them across the state and introduced them to key people. We’re already seeing interesting benefits from these relationships in North Carolina, and we’re excited about the future.

BAILEY: We have clients across the state representing different sides of various issues. I lead our public engagement practice. My goal isn’t necessarily to get consensus but understand the communities that we’re working in and identify their voices and leverage them. We want to know who these communities are and what is important to them.

Growth, as positive as it is, elicits different feelings from different people. We work at the state level, trying to understand these organizations’ macro goals and how they’ll impact communities. That allows our clients to work authentically in these communities, advancing their projects without creating opposition.

It’s great that North Carolina was ranked the top state for business three times. But what does that mean at the community level? It depends on the work being done. We’re tapping into that. Those voices are important, regardless of who you’re advocating for. Sometimes it’s neighbors and property owners. Other times it’s elected officials or community leaders.

What we’re doing well right now is understanding the landscape in North Carolina and how people feel and approach these large issues coming to or growing within the state. Then we adjust our client’s advocacy efforts to be effective with the policies they’re trying to influence. As soon as you think you’ve figured out one viewpoint, there’s a different one. It’s an interesting game to play.

WHAT ARE YOUR CURRENT GOALS?

CASHION: Our policy committees are working through different issues, updating our legislative agenda. We base everything on education, talent supply, competitive business climate, and infrastructure and growth. There’s a plethora of efforts coming from the business community that look at maintaining our position and maintain growth in a balanced way across the state.

We continue to push for the elimination of the state’s franchise tax. The legal climate is a top priority. We’re working to keep dark money — third-party litigation investment — out of North Carolina courts. It’s an investment into a lawsuit for a return to an investor. We believe that’s bad for business, consumers and national security. Our legal institute is working on ideas to attract more corporate headquarters, moving the state into a Delaware-type space. We hope some become policy.

We’re working to remove work barriers. We want more service members and their families to stay in North Carolina after they leave the military. We’re looking at ways to connect them to employment, whether as employees or entrepreneurs. We recently released an energy report. We have a water-supply report that we’re promoting at the General Assembly. We’re working with our communities to decide what that policy needs to look like. Agriculture policy will be top of mind moving forward.

WILLIAMS: Our focus is always on access and affordability for our students. When people think of college, they immediately think of traditional age students, and that’s absolutely true. One concern in reaching our attainment goal of adults with a degree, some college or a credential is that the state’s number of traditional high school graduates is plateauing.

There’s been a slight downtick in the percentage of students going to college since the COVID pandemic. But North Carolina has an increasing number of early college students, who graduate high school with an associate degree. They can transfer anywhere to complete a four-year degree, but they need an affordable way to do it.

North Carolina historically has had one of the country’s lowest out-migration rates; about 7% to 8% of high school graduates left the state for college. That has incrementally increased to between 15% and 17%. They’re going to University of South Carolina, University of Georgia, University of Alabama and other schools that offer in-state tuition rates to our students. The idea behind that is economic development, getting those students there and keeping them after college. Many students come to North Carolina to attend college and remain afterward. But we want our students to stay here. It’s a significant issue.

North Carolina has always had many adult students. About 1.1 million adults in North Carolina have some college but no degree. We want to make completing their degree or credential affordable. Many have families and jobs and need to make returning to the classroom work for them.

Maintaining access and affordability is key. But it’s a challenge, because about half of North Carolina students are eligible for federal Pell grants. It takes federal and other aid, including state need-based scholarships and help from colleges and universities. Put in about $1.3 billion annually in institutional aid, because it takes that complete financial aid package to make it possible for students to attend college.

BAILEY: We understand organizations’ legislative agendas, so when clients come to us, we know who’s out there, what they’re advocating for or against, and how we could work within that. Success is being aware of the environment, from the grassroots to the grass tops — chamber executives, local elected officials, anyone who might not be the ultimate vote on an issue but has significant direct access to that vote. So, we can be smart for our clients on how to approach both levels of the conversation around the issue they’re advocating for at the legislative level.

Sometimes that’s all you need to create the future, the path of the issue. But increasingly there are more voices at play. Their power is everywhere, from traditional lobbying and advocacy streams to viral Instagram campaigns, which can gin up a sentiment around an issue. I’ve seen the latter change the trajectory of a vote in the legislature.

We’re paying more attention to them. Facebook and Reddit conversations, for example, are good ways to understand how people feel. They might be one data point, or they could lead you to change the course of the work. If you don’t pay attention to those, you don’t have the tools to monitor, analyze and potentially equip them with what you want to say. They’re a powerful leg of the stool that needs to be considered.

WHAT ARE YOUR CONCERNS?

WILLIAMS: Many of the negative policy impacts on our colleges and universities are coming at the federal level. There have been major changes. Through the passage of the “Big Beautiful Bill,” the Education Department is limiting funding for graduate and professional student loans. Most of the available financial aid is for undergraduate students.

There is little in terms of grants for graduate and professional students beyond tuition remission or an assistantship or something similar. But those are limited in what colleges can provide. There have been Graduate

Plus loans, but they’re now limited to about 10 different doctoral degrees. PA students aren’t eligible for those loans. Occupational therapy, physical therapy and other healthcare degrees aren’t eligible either. So, we’ll look to the state and others to help fill that void. If a student can’t finance their education, then we won’t have the workforce that we need.

Many North Carolina costs are below the national average. Everybody’s concerned about cost, and we have financial aid to help address that. But at the end of the day, we have to pay our faculty and staff, equip the labs and classrooms, and have everything else that’s required. And students must be able to figure out how to finance it.

CASHION: We released a report that says if the stars align over the next five years, we’ll see an almost $500 billion economic impact, 2 million new jobs and billions in tax revenue. We want to figure out how to make this work.

We recognize that at some points and times controversial, sensitive and complex issues arise in our state’s diverse business community. We must deal with those.

We’re working on the affordable housing piece now. It’s critical to our workforce, and it’s an economic growth opportunity. We want to keep people in communities. In the community where I make my home, for example, 90% of the police department can’t afford to live there. That’s not right.

Some local government leaders don’t appreciate the complexities around why we need more housing. We need to educate them, so they can help solve this crisis. If we don’t, it will be an economic development challenge. I look at it from wastewater, housing, transportation and workforce perspectives. We need to figure out those issues by finding ways in the current political environment to push good policy that helps meet needs. It’s difficult to do politically.

We need to think about transportation infrastructure, too. North Carolina has invested billions in it over the last decade or so. It’s one of the state’s biggest untold success stories as it relates to economic development. Tax regulation and infrastructure are top issues expanding and relocating companies review. North Carolina is in a good spot, but growth brings challenges.

BAILEY: Growth keeps me up at night but not in a bad way. It’s exciting and brings opportunities, whether its data centers or developments in a growing town. It can be many things, so you must define it.

But not everyone wants growth. There are opportunities to drill into that to understand why people are opposed and what might lead them to be more open to it. There are many great organizations that are looking at how we do smart growth in North Carolina.

Technology keeps me up, too. Policymakers want more data and storytelling to justify points. Data is getting easier to generate, analyze and provide. It’s amazing. Technology also gives more people a voice. Flip on your camera, take a picture and post it. You don’t have to be powerful, connected or have credentials to become part of the conversation. That’s not a bad thing; that’s the current reality. The job at the end of the day is learning how to leverage, manage and deal to keep conversations factual, civil and effective for everyone.

WHAT PROJECTS OR INITIATIVES ARE IMPORTANT TO YOUR GROUPS MOVING FORWARD?

WILLIAMS: We’ll be asking for more financial aid for higher education. It’s usually spared from budget cuts, but everything was cut during the Great Recession. It remains below its pre-recession level despite some increases. Students need that support to attend and complete college.

While money from the general fund can be difficult to secure, sports wagering may provide an alternative. Despite our athletic teams playing under the same sports-wagering restrictions, all the higher education funding from it currently goes to UNC institutions. It helps them improve their athletic programs. We want to be competitive for students, because our teams are playing teams that are benefiting. Between 60% and 70% of students at some of our institutions are athletes. They compete in Division I, Division II and Division III, which doesn’t provide athletic scholarships.

Colleges compete against each other in athletics and for enrollment. Most students look at public and private institutions. You often must go to the sixth or seventh most populous cross-app in applications before you find another private college. If a student is deciding between two institutions, then they may go where the athletic facilities are improved and enhanced. That’s a concern for us.

The state’s education sectors collaborate, too. NC College Connect, for example, has the potential to be transformational for many students, helping them understand that college is possible for them. The program guarantees admission to about 30 of our institutions, several UNC institutions and all community colleges, which have open admission, for about 70,000 students, each with a 2.8 or higher weighted GPA, in our public and independent high schools. Let’s figure out your choice, and we’ll discuss financial aid packages.

The program helps North Carolina’s many first-generation college students. It helps students from lower-income families, too. Knowing that you’ve been accepted in early fall and we’re there to help, makes college possible for many students. Though some parents were skeptical when the acceptance letter for their child arrived out of the blue, wondering if it was real. You do have to wonder these days. But it’s a real thing.

The number of applications is tremendous. There were more for the most recent College Application Week, when many colleges and universities waive their application fees, than in

the past.

CASHION: We recently released our second annual lawmaker scorecard, How They Voted. We had 105 Jobs Champions, each scoring 80% or higher on the votes that were taken. We hope their pro-growth and pro-free market philosophy continues. We saw great gains in childcare and public-private partnership legislation, energy and military opportunities, and regulatory reforms.

The General Assembly passed Carolina HealthWorks, one of the biggest pieces of legislation in maybe a generation. We worked with the state Insurance Department on its language to get it approved. It’s for small businesses with between two and 50 employees who are a member of their local chamber or the state chamber. Hopefully, it will drive down healthcare costs, allowing them to invest in their businesses and employees. We’re receiving good feedback. It’s active in the marketplace. The Blue Cross broker network and local chambers are promoting it.",https://images.businessnc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/RTAdvocacy_main_image_web.jpg,N,,2025-12-31 16:59:54.421460

North Carolina has become a national model by refusing to settle for “good enough.” Ending the franchise tax would ensure it remains one.","As 2025 comes to a close, North Carolina stands in an enviable position. After more than a decade of disciplined tax reform, the Tar Heel State has emerged as one of America’s most economically competitive states. CNBC’s America’s Top States for Business rankings once again place North Carolina among the nation’s leaders, confirming what employers and investors already know: North Carolina is a premier place to invest, expand, and create jobs.

That reputation is reinforced by the Tax Foundation’s 2026 State Tax Competitiveness Index, which ranks North Carolina 13th overall — up from 44th as recently as 2013 — ahead of most states that levy all the major taxes and near the top nationally on corporate taxation. This strong showing is no accident. It reflects a flat 4.25% individual income tax, the lowest corporate income tax rate among states that still levy one, at 2.25%, and a sustained commitment to broad tax bases and low rates rather than politically favored credits.

Yet even the Tax Foundation is clear: North Carolina’s biggest remaining obstacle to greater competitiveness is its franchise tax.

What makes the franchise tax different — and harmful

Unlike income-based taxes, the franchise tax is levied on a business’s net worth — its accumulated capital — regardless of whether the business is profitable. Companies pay it year after year simply for owning assets, even in downturns or startup phases. In effect, the tax penalizes investment itself, taxing firms not on what they earn but on what they have built.

The Tax Foundation’s North Carolina profile does not mince words. It calls the franchise tax “unusually aggressive,” noting that it taxes businesses “on their worth rather than their profits,” harming investment and violating basic principles of tax fairness and ability to pay. In a state otherwise defined by pro-growth tax policy, the franchise tax stands out as an anachronism.

Real costs for real businesses

This problem is not theoretical. A 2024 John Locke Foundation report shows that the franchise tax creates especially high compliance costs due to its complexity and traps small businesses and independent contractors in mandatory minimum payments. The burden falls especially hard on mom-and-pop businesses, such as a local plumbing company with fewer than 20 employees that owns a small fleet of work vans. Even in a slow year, that firm owes the franchise tax simply for having invested in the vehicles and equipment it needs to operate — penalizing small businesses not for profits, but for preparedness. The same analysis shows that the tax exposes companies to punitive audits over technical errors rather than real tax avoidance, and that businesses can owe the tax even if they lose money — or even if they have no physical presence in North Carolina, so long as they sell goods here.

And for all that damage, the franchise tax contributes little to state finances. In recent years it has accounted for just over 2% of General Fund revenue, a share that is shrinking further due to recently enacted caps. That is a steep economic price to pay for such a modest and declining return.

That reality leads to the most common objection to repeal — and the least persuasive.

The revenue objection — and why it falls short

Critics will argue that repeal is impractical because the franchise tax still generates revenue. But that objection misunderstands both scale and trade-offs. The amount involved is small enough to absorb through normal economic growth, ongoing budget surpluses, or modest base broadening elsewhere. More importantly, repealing the franchise tax would remove a direct penalty on capital investment, encouraging business expansion that broadens the income and sales tax bases over time. In other words, repeal is not a gamble on growth — it is an exchange of a narrow, distortionary tax for a broader, more sustainable revenue stream.

Other states have recognized this reality. Oklahoma repealed its capital stock tax. Mississippi is phasing its out. Connecticut is completing its repeal. Louisiana has already enacted repeal as part of a broader competitiveness package — and the Tax Foundation expects that move alone to produce meaningful improvements in Louisiana’s rankings and investment climate. Meanwhile, North Carolina risks being left behind, clinging to a tax most states have already abandoned.

What makes this moment especially important is that North Carolina has already done the hard work. The state has resisted the temptation to rely on narrow tax credits and instead built a system based on low rates and neutrality. That approach is precisely why North Carolina ranks so highly among states that levy all major taxes. Eliminating the franchise tax would not be a radical departure — it would be the logical completion of a long-running reform agenda.

A clear next step for 2026

If lawmakers want a single, concrete goal for strengthening North Carolina’s economy in 2026, this is it. Repeal the franchise tax. Remove the last major tax penalty on capital formation. Signal to entrepreneurs, manufacturers, and employers that North Carolina will not tax them for growing, investing, or weathering hard times.

On the East Coast, cultural institutions reclaimed momentum, with museums reopening, expanding, or redefining their civic roles after years of delay and debate. In the Southeast, stewardship of land, legacy, and philanthropy emerged as a dominant force, particularly in Arkansas and Florida, where health, culture, and landscape became tightly interwoven civic tools.

Across the Midwest, institutions turned inward and forward at once, using competitions, campus reinventions, and preservation projects to recalibrate long-standing cultural anchors. In Texas and the broader Southwest, architecture leaned into symbolism and identity, whether through overt monumentality or the careful translation of religious and cultural traditions into building form.

And on the West Coast, consumption remained a throughline, from heritage properties entering the real-estate marketplace to spectacle-driven commercial architecture, our coverage raised familiar questions about access, authorship, and architectural afterlives.

The year’s projects trace a national portrait of architecture honoring what endures, experimenting with new civic models, and, sometimes, doubling down on spectacle.

Cultural Projects Rounded Out the East

Frick, Sotheby’s, Studio Museum

Along Fifth Avenue, the Frick Museum opened with a bang after a renovation from Selldorf Architects that seemed to take its sweet time. It was worth the wait though, as the renovation honored Henry Clay Frick’s 1914 mansion’s historic idiosyncrasies while expanding its capacity. Nearby, the Marcel Breuer–designed building at 75th and Madison reemerged as Sotheby’s global headquarters following a deliberately light-touch intervention by Herzog & de Meuron with PBDW Architects, its Brutalist bulk newly landmarked and stubbornly intact. Uptown, the Studio Museum in Harlem finally returned after a seven-year closure with its first purpose-built home, a stacked concrete-frame building by Adjaye Associates with Cooper Robertson as executive architect that anchors the institution firmly on 125th Street while expanding its civic and curatorial reach. These openings suggest a year that museums in New York City found their footing and honed their individual identities. These openings are setting the stage for whatever bolder gestures might come next, just in time for downtown to once again steal the spotlight in 2026.

Jacob’s Pillow

Over the summer, a new, mass timber Doris Duke Theatre at Jacob’s Pillow was completed by Mecanoo, to replace the black-box venue destroyed by fire in 2020. The theater was designed as a flexible, highly automated performance space, built to support experimental dance indoors and the landscaped rooftop stage. The sustainably built “magic wooden box,” is wrapped in Lunawood siding, and acts as a beacon of dance and movement in the rural Berkshires.

Calder Gardens

Calder Gardens is “more of a tribute than a museum,” landscape architect Piet Oudolf told AN. Philadelphia’s new cultural landmark pairs a deliberately understated pavilion by Herzog & de Meuron with 250 varieties of plants. The design creates a landscape-forward institution that frames rotating displays of Alexander Calder’s work largely underground rather than as monumental objects.

Stewardship Reigned in the Southeast

Building Boom in Bentonville

The Walton’s, well-known for starting a large supermarket chain containing the first three letters of their last name, have redrawn Northwest Arkansas’s cultural, educational, and medical landscape. The Crystal Bridges’s forthcoming expansions, the bikeable Ledger, and Walmart’s Gensler-designed headquarters have collectively turned Bentonville into something like a pseudo-philanthropic city-state with each new project slotting into a tightly coordinated ecosystem. The latest addition, the Bentonville Health Care Campus, is set to extend that network into specialty clinical care. Together with the Heartland Whole Health Institute by Marlon Blackwell Architects, which opened earlier this year, and the Alice L. Walton School of Medicine, which welcomed its first class in July.

Fountainhead by Frank Lloyd Wright

Frank Lloyd Wright’s angular, all-cypress Fountainhead in Jackson, Mississippi, is officially entering public life, as the Mississippi Museum of Art acquires the late-career Usonian masterpiece, furniture and all, after decades of painstaking private stewardship. The move protects the house from renovations that might alter Wright’s design and turns the house into a public asset, making Jackson a small modernist enclave.

Florida’s Cultural Projects

Across Florida this year, cultural and civic projects opened and shared new plans. Many treat landscape as the primary medium through through which architecture earns its public mandate. From Sarasota to the Panhandle to Jacksonville, new work by OLIN, Sweet Sparkman, Kimley-Horn, William Rawn Associates, OLI Architecture, and Civitas is positioning gardens, parks, and cultural campuses as resilient civic infrastructure.

At Marie Selby Botanical Gardens, Phase Two of the campus master plan advances a model of botanical architecture explicitly shaped by storm resilience, net-positive energy systems, and public accessibility, folding research and exhibition into a hardened yet porous landscape. Nearby, Sarasota Orchestra’s future Music Center similarly leans on landscape as connective tissue, embedding its concert hall and education spaces within wetlands, meadows, and outdoor rooms.

That impulse stretches north and east. In Walton County, OLI Architecture’s Longleaf Art Park will frame a single Richard Serra sculpture within a carefully preserved pine flatwoods ecosystem. In Jacksonville, Civitas’s proposal for Metropolitan Park sets out to reimagine a legacy event space as a living river edge.

Underscored by the state’s move to permanently protect Florida’s parks from development, these projects point to a broader recalibration, where landscape stewardship is a civic obligation shaping Florida’s next public works.

The Midwest was a Place of Institutional Reinvention

Nelson Atkins Museum of Art

Weiss/Manfredi, working with SCAPE and a large consultant team, won the international competition to design a new addition to Kansas City’s Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art, beating finalists including Kengo Kuma, Renzo Piano, Selldorf Architects, Studio Gang, and WHY. The competition was first reported by AN in April 2024, with an open call later drawing 182 submissions before six teams were shortlisted. The unanimously selected scheme proposes a “connected tapestry” of additions.

Ford Motor Company Central Campus Building

Ford’s new 2.1-million-square-foot Central Campus Building recently opened in Dearborn, Michigan. It’s a hulking new home base designed by Snøhetta, now acting as the centerpiece of Ford’s reworked Research & Engineering campus. The move marks the company’s official shift away from the midcentury Glass House, its longtime 1956 headquarters a few miles east, which will be decommissioned and demolished as Ford Motor Company ushers its workforce into a shinier era.

Preservation Took a Bow

In Columbus, Indiana, the long-mothballed Crump Theatre inched toward its next act with the selection of DKGR architects to lead its renovation. The 1889 theater has spent the last decade stuck in time. The renovated venue will have a 750-seat performing arts and community venue positioned as a catalyst within Columbus’s Downtown 2030 Plan. The project underscores a broader Midwestern pattern this year, in which local governments and community groups are betting that cultural reuse can do the work of economic development.

That same principle is already in place in Milwaukee, where EUA’s $80.1 million transformation of the Milwaukee Repertory Theater’s home inside a former power plant reached completion. The new Associated Bank Theater Center threads contemporary performance infrastructure through the shell of the 1898 Oneida Street Power Plant.

Monumentality and Symbolism was Discussed in the Southwest

National Medal of Honor Museum

The National Medal of Honor Museum arrived in Arlington this June. The 102,000-square-foot exhibition box by Rafael Viñoly Architects hovers 40 feet above the ground on five megacolumns, one for each military branch. Backed by Jerry Jones and other private donors, the museum leans hard into monumentality with spiraling stairs, a cosmic oculus for the Space Force, and acres of metal cladding. Its message of heroism is loud and clear.

Ismaili Center

After nearly 20 years of planning, the first Ismaili Center in the U.S. opened in the fall. Designed by Farshid Moussavi Architecture, the stone-clad, light-filled cultural campus is equal parts mosque, civic center, and serene garden escape from Allen Parkway traffic. Wrapped in a mashrabiya-style “tapestry of stone,” packed with symbolic triangles, and floating safely above Houston’s floodplain, the design uses Persian architectural traditions to meet the Texas ecology, with monarch butterflies showing up uninvited.

Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation News

First came the open letter. Last year, Aaron Betsky publicly begged the Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation to stop turning Frank Lloyd Wright’s name into a licensing free-for-all. He warned of merch-y afterlives that had little to do with living architecture.

Then came the reset. After years of internal strife, public criticism, and bruising battles over the future of Taliesin and its school, longtime president Stuart Graff announced his departure in 2024, clearing the way for a new chapter and a new leader. In March, the Foundation named Joseph Specter as its new president and CEO, arriving from the Arizona Opera with promises to “strengthen the mission,” “expand influence,” and restore a sense of gravitas to Wright’s legacy.

And then, the Foundation unveiled a $184,900 limited-edition Airstream camper designed in the “Usonian spirit,” lovingly wrapped in Wrightian patterns and officially bearing Frank Lloyd Wright’s name. Compact! Organic! On wheels! Wright wanted architecture to move with life, and apparently life now comes with a hitch, a waiting list, and financing options.

Consumption Was King in the West

Tesla Diner

The Tesla Diner served supercharged nostalgia this summer. Designed by Stantec, it indulges the whims of its fanbase through a retro-futuristic mix of diner, drive-in theater, and supercharging station, complete with 66-foot LED screens, Cybertruck commercials, and a parade of customized Teslas. The architecture vacillates between the fastidious minimalism of an Apple store and the cartoonish detailing of a theme park restaurant sending visitors both back in time about 70 years and toward a techno-utopian future that clashes with its urban surroundings.

Provenance Hit the Los Angeles Real Estate Market

At the beginning of this year, the fires in Los Angeles were all anyone could think about and they dominated AN’s coverage of the city. But as the smoke cleared, the city’s wider real estate market seemed undeterred. In March, Frank Gehry’s Binoculars Building in Venice quietly hit the market after nearly 15 years as a Google office. Showing that a pair of 45-foot binoculars wasn’t immune to the logic of “price upon request.”

In September, David Lynch’s Hollywood Hills compound went up for sale, after the famed director’s death. The filmmaker purchased the primary residence on the lot, designed by Frank Lloyd Wright’s son Lloyd Wright, in 1987, paying $560,000 for the 3-bedroom house faced with pink concrete and chevron detailing.

Then in November, the Stahl House, Case Study House No. 22, designed by Pierre Koenig and canonized by Julius Shulman, was listed for the first time ever. Cantilevered, glassy, and permanently poised above Los Angeles, the house entered the market, prompting questions like: how much will someone pay to own a piece of architectural history and will they let anyone else see it once they do?

Elon Musk's automaker published a press release on Monday with a consensus of analyst predictions for the company's latest quarterly sales, the first time it has publicly given Wall Street such a heads-up.

The delivery consensus, which is a compilation of predictions from analysts selected by Tesla, estimated that the EV giant sold 422,850 vehicles in the last three months of 2025, around 14.6% fewer than the same period last year.

That's lower than Wall Street's wider expectations. Analysts were expecting Tesla to sell 440,907 EVs, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

It's also a surprising move from Tesla, which typically does not issue public communications ahead of critical sales announcements.

Tesla, which is expected to report its latest quarterly sales as soon as Friday, did not respond to a request for comment.

""This is highly unusual for Tesla to send out a press release with quarterly consensus delivery estimates,"" said Gary Black, managing partner at Future Fund, which sold its Tesla holdings in May.

Black wrote in the Tuesday post on X that the release suggested Tesla's Q4 sales were lower than the Bloomberg consensus and were, in his view, likely closer to 420,000.

Investors remain bullish

Tesla's stock price hit a record high this month amid investor optimism over the company's robotaxi push, but the Cybertruck maker's core EV business has had a difficult year.

Tesla was hit hard by the collapse in electric car sales after the $7,500 federal tax credit expired in September.

The company's US sales reportedly fell to their lowest level since 2022 in November, despite the launch of cheaper versions of Tesla's bestselling Model 3 and Y EVs.

Other automakers, including Ford, Hyundai, and Kia, also reported big falls in EV sales in November. Detroit rivals Ford and GM have taken charges of $19.5 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively, as they shift their EV strategies in response to a changing policy landscape.

Things haven't gone much better for Tesla outside the US. The company has been buffeted by fierce competition from local rivals in China, where an army of EV startups has rolled out high-tech electric vehicles at rock-bottom prices.

In Europe, meanwhile, the US automaker's sales have collapsed nearly 30% so far this year amid backlash over Musk's political interventions.

The order was issued under section 202(c) of the Federal Power Act, which allows the Energy Department to keep power plants running during times of crisis, such as war or energy shortages.
“Going backwards is an attempt to force local communities to foot the bill to extend plant operations, and will cost energy consumers more.
A spokesperson said the company received the order at 6 p.m. last night and would be issuing a statement this morning.
Tri-State originally decided to close the plant by the end of 2025 as part of its move to more environmentally-friendly energy sources.","President Donald Trump’s Energy Department is ordering a coal-burning power plant in northwest Colorado to remain open just one day before it was scheduled to shut down.

U.S. Department of Energy Secretary Chris Wright issued an emergency order on Tuesday requiring Craig Station’s Unit 1 plant in Moffat County to keep running until at least March 30, 2026, with an extension possible. The plant was set to close on Dec. 31.

The order was issued under section 202(c) of the Federal Power Act, which allows the Energy Department to keep power plants running during times of crisis, such as war or energy shortages.

Wright’s order claims that Colorado and other Western states face an energy “emergency” due to a “shortage of electric energy, a shortage of facilities for the generation of electric energy, and other causes.”

The closure of coal-burning plants “could lead to the loss of power to homes,” the order states, as well as “businesses in the areas that may be affected by curtailments or power outages, presenting a risk to public health and safety.”

The Trump administration has used similar justifications under the Federal Power Act’s 202(c) section to keep coal plants running in other states.

Gov. Jared Polis, in a statement, condemned the decision, claiming that keeping the plant open will “pass tens of millions in costs to Colorado rate payers.”

He added that the plant is “broken and not needed.”

“Ludicrously, the coal plant isn’t even operational right now, meaning repairs — to the tune of millions of dollars — just to get it running, all on the backs of rural Colorado ratepayers!” Polis stated. “Going backwards is an attempt to force local communities to foot the bill to extend plant operations, and will cost energy consumers more. Today’s action flies in the face of this careful planning, is inconsistent with market forces, and will hurt Coloradans.”

The Craig Press sent questions to Tri-State Generation and Transmission Association, the utility company that operates the Craig station, asking whether claims that the plant is “broken” are accurate and how it plans to respond to the emergency order.

A spokesperson said the company received the order at 6 p.m. last night and would be issuing a statement this morning.

Tri-State originally decided to close the plant by the end of 2025 as part of its move to more environmentally-friendly energy sources. It plans to close the Craig station’s two other coal-burning plants by 2028.

The effort is partly driven by a state law that requires large-scale utility providers to reach 100% renewable electrical energy by 2050. Tri-State is also looking to transition to other energy sources for economic reasons.

U.S. Rep. Jeff Hurd, a Western Slope Republican whose sweeping 3rd Congressional District includes Moffat County, praised the emergency order in a statement on Tuesday, saying that Colorado’s energy policy “has been driven by ideology instead of reality.”

“Plants were scheduled to close to satisfy political timelines, even though the power was still needed and local economies would feel the loss,” stated Hurd, who has pushed for the Trump administration to keep another coal plant running in Pueblo , which is also in his district.

Hurd said the move to keep the Craig plant open “keeps reliable, dispatchable power available when the grid needs it, protects good-paying jobs, and strengthens Colorado’s energy infrastructure at a time when demand is rising and the grid is under strain.”

The state’s energy office and environmental advocates, however, are deeply critical of the decision.

Colorado Energy Office Executive Director Will Toor, in a statement, questioned the U.S. Energy Department’s use of the Federal Power Act, which he said provides the federal government “limited authority” to act during emergencies.

“Colorado does not have an energy emergency,” Toor stated.” In fact, the state, along with the rest of the region, has some of the most reliable power systems in the country.”

The environmental group Earth Justice, also in a statement, claimed the emergency order was “illegal.” It cited an analysis by Grid Strategies showing that if the plant remains open and generates its average output over the last few years, costs could rise to $20 million over 90 days, or approximately $85 million per year.

We need energy regulators and a Governor who are paying close attention to what is happening in people’s homes and wallets.","Dear Editor:

Gov. Mike Braun’s recent appointments to the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission send a clear signal about whose voices are being prioritized – and whose experiences are not.

All three new appointees are white men. That fact alone is not the core problem. The deeper concern is what those appointments represent: a regulatory body that increasingly looks like the executive suites and boardrooms of monopoly utilities rather than the communities bearing the brunt of soaring energy costs across Indiana.

At a moment when Hoosiers are struggling to keep the lights on, the people charged with regulating our utilities should understand firsthand what it means to choose between paying the electric bill and buying groceries, affording medication or keeping up on rent payments. These appointments suggest a troubling disconnect between state leadership and the lived reality of Indiana families.

Hoosiers are hurting right now, and Gov. Braun’s energy agenda is not helping.

In just the past year, electric bills have surged across the state at levels not seen in decades. Customers served by NIPSCO have seen electric bills rise by 27 percent. CenterPoint customers are paying 25 percent more. Duke Energy Indiana customers face increases of roughly 20 percent, and AES Indiana customers are staring down a 12 percent hike.

A report released in November estimated Hoosiers’ electric bills will go up an average of 16.3 percent, costing an extra $260 a year. These are not marginal adjustments. They are household-shaking increases that arrive month after month, regardless of income or circumstance.

In 2025 alone, Braun’s utility regulators rubber-stamped some of the most severe electric rate hikes in the past 20 years. The average statewide investor-owned electric utility bill rose by approximately $28 per month in a single year, with many Hoosiers paying $50 more or more each month than they did just one year ago.

These increases did not happen by accident. They are the predictable result of a regulatory approach that has consistently prioritized utility spending and expansion over affordability. Rather than embracing proven, lower-cost solutions that could reduce pressure on ratepayers, Braun has touted a “build-at-all-costs” energy agenda, doubling down on expensive coal and fossil fuel investments and promoting long-delayed nuclear projects that come with massive price tags and decades of financial risk. Those costs do not disappear. They get passed along to Hoosiers’ monthly bills.

Compounding the problem, the anti-consumer utility legislation Braun signed into law in 2025 all but guarantees higher bills in the future by weakening oversight and shifting more financial risk onto ratepayers. The message to Hoosiers is clear: You’re going to pay more now, and you can expect to pay even more later.

That’s why the Governor’s choices for the IURC are perplexing at best. When regulators share more professional and cultural affinity with the industries they oversee than with the public they serve, the result is predictable: rubber-stamped rate hikes, limited scrutiny of utility spending and a regulatory process that feels inaccessible and unresponsive to everyday Hoosiers.

Indiana has no shortage of qualified women and people of color with deep expertise in energy, consumer protection, environmental justice and public policy. Many were part of the candidate pool. Choosing not to appoint them reflects a missed opportunity to strengthen the Commission with voices that understand energy affordability not as a theoretical concern, but as a lived experience.

Braun has said he wants to focus on affordability and economic opportunity. If that is truly the case, then energy regulation cannot remain business as usual. Appointing regulators who mirror the status quo – at a time when the status quo is failing Hoosiers – is not leadership. It is complacency.

While the Governor cannot change these appointments now, he can chart a better course going forward, holding all commissioners accountable for rigorous oversight, meaningful public engagement and decisions that prioritize ratepayer protection over utility profits. It also requires listening – really listening – to the Hoosiers who show up at hearings, submit comments and speak out about bills they can no longer afford.

Hoosiers do not need more window dressing or procedural box-checking. We need energy regulators and a Governor who are paying close attention to what is happening in people’s homes and wallets. The credibility of our regulatory system and the lives of Hoosiers depend on it.

For the flight the Cessna Caravan was fitted with Overview Energy’s laser and optical systems – similar to that intended for delivery into orbit – and on the ground a receiver of standard solar panels.

As the aircraft flew overhead at an altitude of over 5,000m, the system identified the receiver, locked onto it and delivered power through an eye-safe near infra-red light beam. The panels then converted that light into electricity in the same way they convert sunlight.

Overview Energy reports the next step as piloting a low Earth orbit satellite to demonstrate end to end functionality of the full system in space in 2028.

This is then scheduled be followed with megawatt scale commercial operations with its first geosynchronous orbit satellites in 2030, with the ability to see the sun for over 99% of the time.

The company plans that its satellites should be capable of serving multiple continents, dynamically shifting power delivery based on demand and in particular to meet the needs of energy intensive users such as data centres, growing cities and large military bases.

The receivers are envisaged as existing and future solar projects that will form a flexible energy network that can deliver power instantly to where it's needed.

The near infra-red wavelengths selected are those proven in fibre optic networks, medical imaging and security cameras, making the architecture both highly efficient and passively safe, according to Overview Energy.

To ensure that the lasers are efficient and their wavelengths are in the precise range, they need to be cooled and in space it is proposed the spacecraft should have radiators to reject their heat. For the demo an ice based thermal battery was used to absorb the heat during flight.

Similarly a battery system was used to power the lasers as a proxy for the solar panels that would be used in space.

Overview Energy was founded in 2022 and with its emergence from stealth, also has announced raising $20 million from investors including venture capital firm Engine Ventures.

""[Overview Energy’s] space solar energy approach isn't just technically ambitious; it's designed with real-world deployment in mind from the get-go,” commented Reed Sturtevant, General Partner at Engine Ventures.

Record power transmission

While no details that have been released of the demo in terms of power transmission and losses, another US startup Star Catcher Industries has claimed a record for wireless optical power transmission of more than 1.1kW in a stationary setup with off-the-shelf solar panels at NASA’s Kennedy Space Centre.

This is in excess of the previously claimed May 2025 record of 800W set by the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), with Star Catcher reporting delivery of more than 10MJ of energy during its test campaign.

Star Catcher’s focus is on power delivery to satellites in space – a space energy grid, as the company calls it – rather than to the Earth, and reports during the demonstration delivering energy to multiple commercial off-the-shelf single and triple junction solar panels commonly used in space as well as to customer payloads representing key market segments including space data centres, in-space manufacturing and remote sensing.

Among the demonstrations, Star Catcher reports wirelessly transmitting energy and recharging the onboard batteries of Intuitive Machines’ lunar terrain vehicle to showcase how the technology could expand the operational envelope of such vehicles, particularly during the two-week lunar night and within permanently shadowed regions.

Star Catcher envisages launching its first in-orbit power beaming demonstration in 2026. As evidence of the interest in its technology the company reports having signed six PPAs collectively valued in the tens of millions of dollars in annual recurring revenue through the end of the decade.","https://enlit.stream.prepr.io/52bql5cmgrwx/w_1600,h_900,c_center/overview-energy-satellite-space-header-2025-12-05-175542-ylzo-2.jpg",N,,2025-12-31 14:59:22.296378

Here’s why, and how it can be made more durable.

The CCA is driving down carbon emissions by reducing the number of carbon allowances sold each year. That ensures that fossil fuel use will decrease, which is the objective of the CCA. Revenue from the allowance auctions is being reinvested in a variety of programs that will further reduce emissions and build resilience to climate change.

As the number of allowances decreases, the price of those allowances will rise unless the demand for fossil fuels decreases faster than the number of allowances. Those higher costs would be passed on to consumers. Given the hypersensitivity of many consumers to the price of fuel, that could increase opposition to the CCA.

Opposition to the CCA will not rise if either fossil fuel demand decreases fast enough to prevent rising prices, or if the number of consumers using fossil fuel decreases. Since fossil fuel demand decreases with the decreasing number of fossil fuel consumers, the key to reducing opposition to the CCA is reducing the number of those consumers.

Fossil fuel is primarily used in Washington for transportation and heating (air, water, or food in homes and buildings).

The number of fossil fuel consumers can be reduced by replacing fossil fuel-powered vehicles with vehicles that are powered by something else — primarily electric vehicles — and by replacing fossil fuel-powered heaters with carbon-free heaters; primarily heat pumps. Consumers who do so will no longer care about the price of fuel.

Higher prices for electric vehicles and heat pumps have been a barrier to their purchase, so tax credits and rebates have helped spur sales. Now that federal tax credits for EVs and heat pumps are gone, sales will struggle to grow. The phaseout of federal funding for EV charging stations will also slow EV sales growth.

With the lapse of federal subsidies for electric vehicles and heat pumps, fewer people will electrify their transportation and heating systems, so more people will remain sensitive to the price of fuel. This continued sensitivity renders the CCA vulnerable to calls to repeal it as the number of carbon allowances declines and the price of fuel increases.

If the CCA is to survive another repeal effort, it must deliver more of its considerable revenue to the people who are most sensitive to the price of fuel: those using fuel-burning vehicles and appliances.

Total CCA revenue is now $4.3 billion. Of that, only 7% is for electrifying transportation, and 10% is for buildings. To protect the CCA, more of the revenue should be allocated to EV and heat pump rebates.",https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/12262025_tzr_tzr_175047.jpg?d=1200x630,N,,2025-12-31 12:58:57.366843

Letter from Mayor Ballantyne

Dear Somerville Community,

My vision for Somerville is an inclusive, equitable city where we can all thrive together.

When I took office as Mayor in 2022, this vision guided every decision we made at City Hall. This report summarizes what we accomplished together over the past four years during a period of both challenge and tremendous progress.

I submit this report so that as the next and future administrations set their course, they have a quick reference for areas of success and challenge to build on and address. I also place this in the record in gratitude and recognition of all who believed in and helped create progress in this amazing place we call Somerville over the past four years.

Building an Inclusive City

Inclusiveness means the people most affected by our policies have a seat at the table. Through new initiatives such as Participatory Budgeting, a multi-focused Anti-Displacement Task Force, and our expansive Public Safety For All efforts, we ensured community voices shaped our direction. We intensified outreach to meet residents where they are, building trust and creating opportunities for meaningful participation.

Whether the expansion of outreach staff across departments to grow citywide capacity or the focused intensive push to add literally hundreds of new engagement opportunities, we followed our commitment to keep our ear to the ground and honor that input with serious review and thoughtful follow-through.

An inclusive City means all of us supporting our values, even if they are challenged by our federal administration. That’s why I filed a lawsuit with Chelsea in defense of all our residents, regardless of immigration status.

Advancing Equity

A number of residents and staff have told me I could have taken the easy way out with our American Rescue Plan Act funding. It would be easier to just fund large infrastructure projects in one fell swoop and ignore the complex social impacts of Covid. We didn't. Instead, we covered multiple needs with $35 million invested in infrastructure and $40 million delivering initiatives and services for our most vulnerable residents.

Spending on infrastructure has a generational impact on our debt, budget, constituents, and community, and it is critical to address these foundational needs. We helped our people recover from COVID's impacts through often ground-breaking programs that staff mobilized to stand up. The complexity of this cannot be understated. Municipal innovation requires navigating challenging law, procurement, and capacity issues all while doing our regular daily work. From flexible rental assistance, guaranteed basic income, childcare support, and much more, we pushed for impact and delivered it.

Pay Equity and Investing in Our Workforce

We also took on structural inequities within the City workforce. Through the Wage and Compensation Study, and the negotiations that followed, we lifted historically low salaries within SMEU and improved benefits while righting long-standing inequities between comparable jobs. This is lasting pay equity and a reflection of my administration’s and our community’s commitment to doing what is right. More than just delivering updates to the same old contracts with the same old inequities built in, this was my administration acknowledging the right thing to do.

Deep investments in our schools addressed the same for educators and school staff. In the 9 current collective bargaining agreements between the school district and educator and staff unions, pay equity is at the very center. The most recent contract, taking effect in SY26, raised our school paraprofessionals’ pay to $50,000 a year, with full parental leave by the third contract year, setting us far above counterparts in Massachusetts and neighboring communities. The greatest impact here is that we lifted people up from the bottom.

With the same focus on attracting and retaining quality employees, we enhanced our Family Medical Leave Policy to be Paid Family Medical Leave. This new policy allows for 8 weeks paid leave for employees to care for themselves for a serious medical condition, birth/adoption of a child, and paid time off to care for immediate families with serious medical conditions, as well. My administration recognized the need to care for employees so they can care for our constituents.

Creating Opportunities to Thrive Together

To deliver on our progressive values, we must diversify and grow our revenue. That's why as a core focus of the last four years, and my entire time as an elected official, I pursued strategic commercial development. As a City Councilor, I pushed to increase the mixed minimum unit ratio for housing to commercial in transform districts, and as a Mayor, I helped set the City up to generate roughly $255 million in community benefits from major development efforts such as “Tough Tech” zoning on Somerville Ave, and the large planning projects at Brickbottom and Assembly Square. We also developed a tax increment financing agreement for the Winter Hill Urban Renewal Plan at 299 Broadway, allowing us to advance this long-planned affordable mix-use project. With affordable housing linkage fees, job creation agreements, and the tax base and benefits to invest in our schools, our streets, and our people, development in Somerville is the engine behind social progress.

With this approach, my administration was able to increase and invest in the Somerville Public Schools budget by 34% over four years. We were able to accelerate making our streets safer for everyone and save lives. We were able to build or upgrade 13 parks. We were able to create the Somerville Pollinator Action Plan that won national recognition for leading the way for other municipalities to help prevent pollinator population collapse. We developed “tough tech” zoning that established a model framework to support development for clean energy and transformative technologies, while also enhancing arts zoning to ensure parity and protection within our industrial districts.

My administration understood fiscal responsibility as a keystone to our ability to deliver for constituents. With sound management of city assets and growing revenues, Somerville achieved ‘AAA’ bond rating – the highest long-term municipal bond credit rating – for the first time in the City’s history in May 2023 and then maintained ‘AAA’ for three consecutive years. This status has been crucial for lowering borrowing rates for the city’s critical major infrastructure investments. Especially in a time when federal funding and economic uncertainty threatens our coffers, the pursuit of economic resilience is and must remain a central focus, so that Somerville’s core services and progressive goals can be maintained and attained.

A Thriving Future

This work reflects both my administration's efforts and our partnership with staff across all departments, and countless community members. When I first ran for Mayor, I promised open and inclusive government, affordability, jobs, good governance, climate change mitigation, and strong schools. This report shows how we delivered on those promises while charting the course for future progress.

The challenges of COVID-19 tested us, but we came through stronger. We've put plans and roadmaps in place to meet long-term challenges, guided by experts and community input. We've made measurable progress on residents' wellbeing and city operations.

Thank you to everyone who contributed to this work—City staff, community partners, residents who showed up to meetings and surveys, and all who believe in Somerville's potential. Together, we've built a foundation and set the course for a city where everyone can truly thrive.

With gratitude and hope for our future,

Katjana Ballantyne

Mayor, City of Somerville

Introduction

“My vision for Somerville is an inclusive, equitable city where we can all thrive together.”

– Mayor Katjana Ballantyne

From 2022 – 2025, Mayor Ballantyne’s work at City Hall has reflected her vision of governance. Through her capacity as an executive of City departments and services, as well as an advocate at the state and federal levels, Mayor Ballantyne has led a wide range of initiatives to make Somerville a place where everyone can thrive. Initiatives were designed for measurable impact on constituents’ wellbeing and on the quality of City’s operations. Plans and roadmaps were developed with deep community input and guidance from experts with a focus on delivering real progress not just for, but also driven by, community members.

This report summarizes the City’s key efforts during Mayor Ballantyne’s two terms. While not intended to be an exhaustive list, it offers an overview of core priorities that the community and future administrations can build on.

Section I. Inclusiveness: Inclusive leadership means ensuring that community members have an opportunity to fully participate in the City’s governance. To achieve that, the Ballantyne administration has focused on three key areas of work among other efforts: 1) Civic participation and responsive government; 2) accessibility of services and resources; and 3) a focus on uplifting vulnerable and historically underrepresented communities, including immigrants.

Section II. Equity and Wellbeing: An essential tenet of the last four years has been equitable access to opportunity, resources, and wellbeing and dignity for all constituents, particularly those with the greatest need or who have historically been underserved. This section describes six major areas of work, including 1) Urgent responses to the COVID-19 pandemic; 2) supporting youth and education; 3) supporting unhoused residents and promoting substance use harm reduction; 4) supporting seniors and veterans; 5) public safety and racial & social justice; and 6) safe and accessible transit for all.

Lastly, in making Somerville a place “where we can all thrive together,” Mayor Ballantyne’s administration has employed a multi-layered agenda that encompasses making life more affordable for all, creating economic opportunity, and enhancing sustainability in the city’s infrastructure and operations. The sections below detail these initiatives.

Section III. Thriving – Affordability: Creating an affordable city entails supporting community members through challenges in cost of living. The Ballantyne administration’s three major areas of work include: 1) Supporting limited-income residents and families; 2) Housing stability and anti-displacement policies and measures; and 3) Improving people’s access to housing units, by facilitating unit creation and lowering barriers for renters and buyers.

Section IV. Thriving – Economic Opportunity: A vibrant local economy generates jobs, supports small and anchor businesses, maintains Somerville’s cultural diversity, is equitable for all, and supports education and skill building so that community members are prepared to seize opportunities. Here, the Ballantyne administration’s major areas of work include: 1) Commercial development and bringing jobs to the city, with an emphasis on shifting the tax burden from residential to the commercial sector, and zoning and planning for sustained revenue growth through future-oriented industries; 2) Improving jobs and investing in workplace development; and 3) Supporting small businesses and the arts.

Section V: Thriving – Sustainability: Somerville remains a leader in investing in infrastructure, people, and practices that ensure a well-functioning city into the future. The City’s major areas of work include: 1) Climate action and our environment; 2) Updating our urban infrastructure; and 3) Enhancing the City’s capacity to deliver services.

Section I: Inclusiveness

I.1: Civic participation and responsive government

City government should be accessible to and representative of all residents. Residents should be able to engage in governance and their community in ways that meet their needs. Under Mayor Ballantyne’s two terms, the administration has increased civic participation by thousands and access to government in ways that reflect the local constituency as well as modern advances.

Major initiatives to highlight include:

Commitment to community engagement: Delivered targeted community engagement opportunities that built meaningful opportunities for community members to shape policies, priorities, and goals. From engagement in setting priorities for the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) funding, to deep work on Public Safety for All and Anti-Displacement, to the Cultural Arts Plan, a deep commitment to ensuring a public voice in public priorities was interwoven into our policy making and planning. A city-wide survey and robust community engagement process regarding critical choices in the future of the next PK-8 school garnered very high participation.

For example, in 2021, ARPA brought an unprecedented funding opportunity to Somerville. To ensure that residents’ needs were met, the City conducted a community engagement process that included surveys with more than 1,500 responses, more than 20 focus groups, tabling events, and a 15-member Advisory Board consisting of residents, a School Committee member, and a City Councilor. You can draw a straight line from those outcomes to funding priorities pursued that had profound impacts on residents including flexible rental assistance, guaranteed basic income, and more.

Participatory budgeting: The launch of the city’s first Participatory Budgeting program in 2022, which biannually funds $1 million of community projects proposed by residents. Two cycles of Participatory Budgeting have occurred so far, with 11 impactful projects underway, ranging from composting to expanding access to after school programs to investing in the Bike Network Plan.

Civic access: Expanded civic gatherings where residents can connect with City staff and elected officials directly. The “Slice of the City” meeting series, for example, creates informal gatherings in each ward’s local parks, where community members can chat with City staff and their elected officials over dinner.

Civic Day: Established the city’s first annual Civic Day event, which offers engaging ways to browse, learn about, and connect with city functions in all departments at one “science fair” like setting and also builds connection to City Hall staff.

Equity Support Team: The creation of the Equity Support Team in the Somerville Office of Immigrant Affairs built up our capacity to reach adults and youth where they are and connect them to engagement opportunities citywide. This part-time team of 11 includes both adults and youth serving six languages who go into the community to inform and engage residents face to face in support of initiatives across all departments. From parks to festivals to parent or community groups, they meet our residents where they are, ensuring we reach more people who cannot or do not come to us and build their comfort, access, and leadership opportunities going forward.

Grew 311 Constituent Services: 311 is a gateway to engagement. Constituents’ calls to City Hall can not only solve an immediate issue, but also pull them into civic life. Since 2022, the City increased 311 staffing and engaged in communitywide promotion, to both meet constituents’ requests and to build trust and connection with every service delivery. Callers have consistently reported high satisfaction with the City’s responsiveness and services.

Expanded Happiness/Wellbeing Survey: SomerStat, the Mayor’s Office of Innovation and Analytics, provides timely analysis and reporting to help City staff and residents measure progress toward community goals and understand local challenges. SomerStat has expanded and enhanced the Happiness Survey, occurring every other year and providing community members with useful data on numerous quality-of-life metrics. The last two Surveys have shown that residents and community members are happy with life in the City of Somerville. Survey outcomes are shared on a public-facing interactive dashboard for constituents and staff alike to explore the data freely.

These initiatives were developed and implemented through the Communications and Community Engagement Department, Constituent Services Division, the Somerville Office of Immigrant Affairs, the Executive Office, ARPA Division, SomerStat Division, the Finance Department: Budget Division, and all of the departments and divisions funded by the Participatory Budgeting winning projects.

I.2: Improving accessibility for all

The Ballantyne Administration strives to make services and resources accessible to all community members, and to reduce physical, linguistic, technological, and cultural barriers to access.

Major initiatives to highlight include:

Language access initiatives spearheaded by the Somerville Office of Immigrant Affairs (SOIA), which manages all translation, interpretation, and multilingual communications for the city; develops and implements city-wide policies on accessible, equitable, and effective communications; and provides trainings for staff in on-demand telephonic interpretation, plain language, and language justice best practices, in partnership with the Communications team. In 2025, SOIA launched the city-wide language interpretation line service, which provides immediate access to interpretation in 350+ languages, so City staff can effectively serve the public and interact with constituents.

Launching two initiatives to update the City’s Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) Transition Plan, established a decade ago, to bring all City policies and procedures into compliance with the ADA. In February 2023, the City’s Accessibility Services Division conducted a community survey to understand needs and priorities. In January 2025, the ADA Transition Task Force was formed with constituents and expert advisors, working towards recommendations for updating the current Plan and informing accessibility efforts more generally.

Since 2023, the City secured its own braille embosser, allowing City documents to be embossed for residents in need. This includes weekly City Council agendas and accessible voting information for the 2025 election.

Embedding the Accessibility Services Division in City programming more broadly, including review of communications, attending planning and public meetings, delivering trainings to internal and external partners, and directing stakeholder accessibility concerns to appropriate departments.

The Digital Bridge Initiative started in 2023, and aims to address the digital divide in Somerville to ensure all can use the internet with ease. The initiative kicked off with a Digital Equity Plan to map out needs and possibilities, and continued to both enhance existing digital inclusion programming and create new opportunities to fill gaps. As a result, the City of Somerville was nationally recognized as a 2023 Digital Inclusion Trailblazer.

Celebrating Disability Pride Month with annual flag raising ceremony and family events since 2024.

For more on safe and accessible transit throughout the City, see section II.6 below.

These initiatives were developed and implemented through the Department of Racial and Social Justice, RSJ: Accessibility Services Division, Office of Strategic Planning and Community Development, OSPCD: Economic Development, Communications and Community Engagement Department, Somerville Office of Immigrant Affairs, and other implementing departments, offices, and partners.

I.3: Supporting Somerville’s immigrants

Somerville has long been a home for people from all places around the world, and has adopted a resolution of its status as a sanctuary city for immigrants since 1987. In the past four years, the Ballantyne Administration has reaffirmed its commitment to include immigrants in all parts of civic life through policies, programs, and advocacy.

Major initiatives to highlight include:

Filing a federal lawsuit in February 2025, jointly between the Cities of Somerville and Chelsea, to challenge the Trump Administration’s efforts to coerce them into participating in mass deportation efforts. Somerville and Chelsea have committed to being sanctuary / welcoming cities for decades. The lawsuit asserts that the federal government’s attempts to strip localities of federal funding for not participating in mass deportation efforts are unconstitutional. Lawyers for Civil Rights, the organization representing Somerville and Chelsea, awarded Mayor Ballantyne with the Diversity Champion Award in June 2025.

Conducting over 184 multilingual Know Your Rights trainings for City employees and community members. Hosted by the Somerville Office of Immigrant Affairs (SOIA) with a wide variety of City and local organizational partners, these workshops help to ensure all residents have accurate and reliable information on their rights.

Connecting 114+ constituents with full immigration legal representation provided by City-contracted legal organizations, as well as referrals to nonprofits and pro-bono attorneys in the community. Services include information clinics, consultation sessions, assistance in filing applications, emergency preparedness planning, and legal representation.

Leading and supporting community workshops and trainings to promote immigrant leadership, such as the IMPACT Group for Spanish-speaking parents, the Haitian Coalition of Business Owners in Somerville, and financial literacy trainings for Portuguese-speaking community members.

Continued expansion of the City’s cultural celebrations, including the first Hong Kong Festival, the first Haitian Flag Festival, and the first raising of the Brazilian, Italian, Indian, and Turkish flags. Representing our constituents through celebration enhances community cohesion, respect, and joy.

These initiatives were developed and implemented through the Somerville Office of Immigrant Affairs, the Law Department, the Mayor’s Office: Intergovernmental Affairs, Somerville Public Schools: Somerville Family Learning Collaborative, and numerous other community partners.

Section II: Equity & Wellbeing

II.1: Urgent response to the COVID-19 pandemic

Mayor Ballantyne took office during the Omicron surge of the COVID-19 pandemic, and continued the work of supporting residents during a global emergency. The Ballantyne Administration enacted rapid responses to address urgent and emergent needs in public health services, access to support resources, and infrastructure updates for health and safety.

Major initiatives to highlight include:

The rapid stand-up of new testing sites, weekly vaccination clinics, the purchase and distribution of 260,000 high-quality masks, and distribution of more than 50,000 test kits.

A local eviction moratorium that was extended multiple times until June 30, 2022, the last remaining municipal eviction moratorium in Massachusetts.

The launch of a flexible rental assistance program, initiated with $4.3 million in American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) funds in 2022, to provide more flexible rental support than existing programs in a time of great need.

$2.5 million in one-time ARPA-funded grants and technical assistance to 90 small businesses, as well as a first-ever marketing support campaign, to help businesses weather the negative economic impacts of the pandemic.

Nearly $1.5 million of ARPA funds spent on operating support for 91 nonprofits serving Somerville residents, ensuring continuity of critical services. $10 million of ARPA funds spent on grants to 38 nonprofits to help not just relieve but recover from the pandemic.

Food support programs such as Carrot Cards (monthly reloadable debit cards for students and families) and Just Eats Boxes (grocery box deliveries for residents of need), funded by ARPA through the Office of Food Access and Healthy Communities and administered by local nonprofit Food For Free, to ensure accessibility, nutrition, and safety during the COVID-19 Omicron surge and beyond.

Heightened support to City social service teams to ensure resident connection to resources during the continued recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.

These initiatives were developed and implemented through the Health and Human Services Department, HHS: Office of Food Access and Healthy Communities, the Office of Strategic Planning and Community Development Department: Economic Development Division, the Communications and Community Engagement Department, and innumerable volunteers and community partners.

II.2: Supporting youth and education

To support youth and education, the Ballantyne Administration has invested in a multi-partner strategy that connects, aligns, and mobilizes resources to ensure every child in Somerville can thrive, from cradle to career.

Major initiatives to highlight include:

A 34% increase to the Somerville Public Schools budget over 4 fiscal years, and a newly-ratified bargaining agreement with the Somerville Educators Union for FY22 and FY26. These investments help protect against staff cuts seen in other districts, improve compensation, and expand student support services.

Launching the K-8 Schools Master Plan in early 2022, which informs the City’s approach to school building usage, renovations, and construction over the next generation. In FY26, these efforts included the construction of a new classroom space at the Argenziano School.

Initiating the Massachusetts School Building Authority (MSBA) process in April 2023, to obtain state funding to renovate and rebuild Winter Hill Community Innovation School, and potentially address the aging facility at the Brown School. Mayor Ballantyne advocated and committed resources towards the initiative to facilitate moving quickly from Eligibility into Feasibility Phase by November 2024.

Continued investment in the Somerville Hub, a one-stop resource center for families and children of all ages, making nearly 800 referrals per year to resources, benefits, and assistance.

COHR held extensive trainings in recognizing signs and symptoms of behavioral health crises and understanding how these can impact calls for service, to better inform police response.

Continuing formal Jail diversions, through COHR in partnership with SPD, which aims to divert individuals from the criminal justice system towards mental health and substance use recovery paths, both pre- and post-arraignment.

These initiatives were developed and implemented through the Department of Racial and Social Justice, Somerville Police Department, SomerStat Division, and community members and partners.

II.6: Safe and accessible transit

The Ballantyne Administration has committed to making Somerville’s streets safer and more accessible for people of all ages and abilities. Many departments have worked together to plan and implement safer street designs, identify priority areas and neighborhoods, and build out programs to improve transit access.

Major initiatives to highlight include:

Implementing the Somerville Vision Zero Action Plan, which aims to eliminate traffic fatalities and severe injuries across the City. Vision Zero has guided re-engineering of dangerous intersections, the addition of more slow-speed safety zones, the reconstruction of 11 miles of roads and 10 miles of sidewalks, and the expansion of data-driven siting for interventions. In the past 4 years, the City has tripled its traffic calming production while transforming the community engagement process. As a result, Somerville has achieved zero traffic fatalities for a third year in a row to date, and continues to diligently work toward zero fatalities in the future.

A well-functioning government ensures efficient and effective delivery of services. The Ballantyne Administration has invested in its operations over the last four years in order to more effectively serve and impact the community.

Major initiatives to highlight include:

AAA bond rating: In May 2023, the City of Somerville was awarded the highest long-term debt rating of 'AAA' from the municipal bond credit rating agency S&P Global Ratings, a historic first that the City has since maintained for three consecutive years. This upgraded status reaffirms the City’s financial stability and creditworthiness, and offers lower borrowing rates for critical infrastructure investments.

Updated City Charter: A new City charter was approved by voters in November 2025 after years of work by stakeholders across the community. Improvements to the charter include the update of various requirements to bring them in line with modern practices, adjustment of budget hearing and review timelines, and increased oversight by the City Council regarding appointments, auditing, and more.

Focus on hiring and retention: This administration focused on hiring to fill critical vacancies, as well as retaining and supporting existing staff at the City. Efforts include the Work Better Task Force in 2023, aimed at improving staff’s work environment and productivity, and the Wage and Compensation Study, which ensured comparable pay for similar roles across all departments and evaluated competitiveness with other municipalities. Internal surveys also indicate high workplace satisfaction from staff.

Scaling the organization: As City services grew in their scale, supportive departments such as Finance divisions and Procurement and Contracting Services were expanded to ensure efficiency. New ways of organizing teams were also implemented, such as the restructuring of the Health and Human Services and Water and Sewer Departments to scale and optimize service delivery, and hiring finance managers directly into major departments to support operations.

Data, monitoring, and evaluation: In the last four years, SomerStat has coordinated with departments to create more standardized and effective surveys for civic feedback, and to analyze results comparably over time and across efforts. SomerStat’s Open Data Portal also provides all residents with access to public data, with visualizations and data dictionaries to lower technical barriers for use. Looking ahead, SomerStat is working on overarching upgrades such as systematizing evaluation protocols, and creating long-range performance management systems to track progress toward Somervision 2040 goals.

Abbott touts Texas fueling the nuclear renaissance, booming energy sector AUSTIN — Governor Greg Abbott touted Texas’ booming energy industry as the nation’s leader in energy production, powering America’s economy and leading the nation in investment in the advanced nuclear energy industry.

“This year Texas took a magnificent step in becoming the headquarters of the American Nuclear Renaissance,” said Governor Abbott. “By solidifying our great state as a prairie for nuclear energy to thrive, Texas’ energy ecosystem is stronger than ever before. Texas is investing in the future of the world’s energy sector and protecting the petroleum industry, the lifeblood of the state’s economy, to power our state for generations to come.”

2025 Highlights from Texas’ Energy Sector: Governor Abbott Signs Oilfield Theft Protection, Pro-Growth Legislation Into Law In June, Governor Greg Abbott signed into law key legislation to protect Texas’ oil and gas industry and promote economic growth across West Texas, including Senate Bill 494, Senate Bill 529, Senate Bill 1806, House Bill 48, and the Beacon Budget Appropriation.

“Today is a defining moment for the Permian Basin, the future of this region, and the future of Texas,” said Governor Abbott. “We are bringing the full weight of the law to crack down on oil theft in the Permian Basin to protect the critical role energy development plays in fueling our economy. I’m also signing an item to fund an historic $123 million investment in The Beacon, a pivotal economic development project for Midland-Odessa.”

Senate Bill 494 (Sparks/ Landgraf) establishes a petroleum product theft task force.

Senate Bill 529 (Sparks/ Craddick) alters the tax code for the City of Midland to divert certain collected tax revenue for economic development projects.

Senate Bill 1806 (Sparks/ Craddick) provides the Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS) with additional tools to combat oil and gas theft.

House Bill 48 (Darby/ Sparks) creates an organized oilfield theft prevention unit within DPS to protect oilfield assets, support the energy industry, safeguard economic stability, and enhance public safety.

Beacon Budget Appropriation was appropriated by the Texas Legislature to the Texas Facilities Commission to support Beacon Healthcare in extending healthcare, research, residential, and retails spaces in the region.

Governor Abbott Congratulates Texas Legislature For Passing Nuclear Power Legislation In June, Governor Greg Abbott congratulated the Texas Legislature for passing House Bill 14, which revolutionized Texas’ growing nuclear industry and will lead a nuclear power renaissance in the United States.

“Texas is the energy capital of the world, and this legislation will position Texas at the forefront of America’s nuclear renaissance,” said Governor Abbott. “By creating the Texas Advanced Nuclear Energy Office and investing $350 million—the largest national commitment—we will jumpstart next-generation nuclear development and deployment. This initiative will also strengthen Texas’ nuclear manufacturing capacity, rebuild a domestic fuel cycle supply chain, and train the future nuclear workforce. I look forward to signing it into law.”

House Bill 14 (Harris/ Alders) establishes the Texas Advanced Nuclear Energy Office to, among other objectives, lead the transition to a balanced energy future by advancing innovative nuclear energy generation technologies while delivering safe, reliable, and clean energy solutions that address the state’s growing demand.

Governor Abbott Names Shaffer Director Of The Texas Advanced Nuclear Energy Office In September, Governor Greg Abbott named Jarred Shaffer as Director of the Texas Advanced Nuclear Energy Office (TANEO). TANEO provides strategic leadership to support advanced nuclear project development within Texas and administering the $350 million Texas Advanced Nuclear Development Fund to incentivize the development of the nuclear energy industry in Texas.

“The state of Texas continues to build the world’s most robust and diverse energy sector,” said Governor Abbott. “TANEO and the Texas Advanced Nuclear Development Fund will increase Texas’ investment in an all-of-the-above energy approach to solidify Texas as the world’s energy hub. Jarred Shaffer’s expertise on energy issues makes him the best fit to streamline the nuclear regulatory environment and direct investments to spur a flourishing and competitive nuclear power industry in the Lone Star State. Texas will lead the nuclear renaissance.”

As TANEO begins its work, it is publishing a Request for Information (RFI) from the public and interested stakeholders in the areas of TANEO’s advanced nuclear energy strategic plan development, permitting feedback, regulatory study, and grant application review.

Those interested in responding to this RFI, submit the completed RFI and attachments, if applicable, to taneo@gov.texas. gov with the subject line “Request for Information Form_LAST NAME”.

Governor Abbott Delivers Remarks At 2025 Texas Nuclear Summit In October. Governor Greg Abbott delivered remarks on Texas leading the nuclear renaissance in America and received the “Atomic Texan Award” at the 2025 Texas Nuclear Summit.

“As the Texas economy continues to grow, the lifeblood of every business increasingly depends upon affordable, reliable power,” said Governor Abbott. “To power our future, Texas must be the epicenter for nuclear power generation. Altogether, we have amassed the resources, infrastructure, and the strategy to be able to advance the nuclear renaissance here in the state of Texas.”

This year, Texas launched the Texas Energy Fund (TxEF) to provide grants and loans to finance the construct ion, maintenance, and modernization of electric facilities in Texas.

Abbott announced six significant TxEF investments into the energy industry for the following projects:

• Up to $105 million to the Rock Island Generation Project, for a 122 megawatt (MW) natural gas power plant in Colorado County.

• Up to $216 million to NRG Energy Inc.(Houston), for a 456 megawatt (MW) natural gas power plant in Houston.

• Up to $516 million to NRG Energy, Inc. (Baytown), for a 721 megawatt (MW) natural gas power plant near Baytown.

• Up to $464 million to Calpine Corporation, for a 460 megawatt (MW) natural gas power plant in Fairfield.

• Up to $1.12 billion to Competitive Power Ventures Basin Ranch, for a 1,350 megawatt (MW) natural gas power plant in Ward County.",https://static2.coloradocountycitizen.com/data/wysiwig/coloradocountycitizenfavicon-small.png,N,,2025-12-31 16:59:49.905187

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency announced in November a proposal to implement more exceptions for businesses to report the levels of perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, also known as forever chemicals.

“This data is necessary for EPA to evaluate and manage the risks associated with PFAS exposure and to prevent harm to human health and the environment,” the attorneys general representing 15 states wrote in a Dec. 22 comment letter. “EPA fails to provide a reasoned explanation for its sudden reversal and ignores the substantial body of reliable scientific research showing the importance of collecting this data.”

PFAS have been used in consumer products since the 1940s — including clothing, non-stick cookware, food packaging, car seats, and strollers.

The chemicals have been known to cause harms such as the increased risk of kidney, breast, pancreas, prostate, and testicular cancers as well as liver damage, high cholesterol and infertility.

“North Carolinians should be able to get straightforward information about how much and what kinds of PFAS are in the products we buy,” Jackson said in a Tuesday statement. “The EPA shouldn’t be helping companies hide what kinds of toxic chemicals they’re using. We know what PFAS damage looks like in North Carolina, and we need these companies to be more responsible.”

Jackson’s office has filed lawsuits against DuPont and Chemours, two chemical companies, for their role in PFAS contamination to natural resources and drinking water in the Cape Fear River Basin and its communities.

The EPA claims the proposed change would reduce duplicity and make reporting more straightforward for businesses.

“This Biden-era rule would have imposed crushing regulatory burdens and nearly $1 billion in implementation costs on American businesses,” EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said in a statement. “Today’s proposal is grounded in commonsense and the law, allowing us to collect the information we need to help combat PFAS contamination without placing ridiculous requirements on manufacturers, especially the small businesses that drive our country’s economy.

Families were reshuffling budgets, truckers were adding unavoidable surcharges, and businesses were raising prices simply to stay afloat. At the same time, Americans were told that there was little anyone in Washington could do to ease the burden. The message stayed the same for months: global forces were responsible, and there was no quick fix for the pain drivers were feeling at the pump.

Yet while families struggled with the highest fuel prices ever recorded — a national average of $5.02 per gallon — the federal government was encouraging Americans to buy electric vehicles costing between $50,000 and $70,000.

Transportation officials suggested that the “more pain” people felt from gasoline prices, the more attractive EVs would become. Energy officials repeated that an electric car was the fastest way for families to reduce their gas bill to zero. For most households, though, the math just didn’t work. The average new EV price in 2022 was $66,000 according to Kelley Blue Book, while the median U.S. household income was around $74,000. A new electric car was not an immediate or practical solution.

Meanwhile, federal actions during those early years reflected a shift away from domestic oil development. The Keystone XL pipeline permit was canceled on day one, new federal oil and gas leasing was paused, existing Arctic leases were withdrawn, and a record 180 million barrels were released from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Drilling permits decreased, and U.S. oil production fell below 2020 levels despite growing demand. Those choices — combined with refinery constraints and global volatility — kept domestic supply from growing at the pace needed to bring relief.

The landscape looks very different today. By late 2025, U.S. energy production had expanded significantly. Federal lands reopened for leasing, permitting became faster, and producers were able to meet more of the country’s energy needs. American crude oil production climbed to an all-time high of 13.4 million barrels per day, and the number of active drilling rigs rose substantially from pandemic-era lows. More supply began moving through the system, helping stabilize markets that had been strained for years.

The results are unmistakable. The national average for regular gasoline sits near $3 per gallon — roughly 40 percent lower than the 2022 peak. And it isn’t just a handful of states seeing relief. Eighteen states now have average prices below $2.75. Drivers in Texas, Oklahoma, Mississippi, and several others are routinely seeing prices starting with a “2,” a number many thought wouldn’t return anytime soon. These aren’t isolated discounts; they are widespread indicators of stronger supply and more balanced market conditions.

It remains true that no president controls gas prices outright. Global crude markets, refinery operations, seasonal demand, transportation costs, and taxes all influence what drivers pay. But federal policy does shape how quickly American energy can be produced, moved, and delivered. When supply is constrained, prices rise. When supply grows, prices ease. The past three years have demonstrated this in real time.

The contrast between the experience of 2022 and the reality of 2025 underscores a simple point: energy policy affects everyday life in immediate, measurable ways. It determines what families pay to commute, what businesses spend to operate, and what consumers pay for goods delivered across the country. It is not theoretical. It shows up every time someone fills their tank.

For millions of Americans now seeing sub-$3 gasoline again, the numbers tell the story more clearly than any political argument.

2025 has been a dark time for Americans who care about the environment. Rather than being a repeat of his first term, which had been bad enough , Trump’s second term has been an all-out, brutal assault on the environment.. Major environmental rollbacks are on the way, as they were in his first term,although the rollbacks are more sweeping this time. But regulatory rollbacks can be fought in court. Other Trump actions are even more damaging.

The biggest damage has been structural. First, the Administration has ignored the law to cancel or even claw back billions of dollars in spending for the environment and clean energy. Congress chimed in by repealing most of the Inflation Reduction Act, eliminating future funding and phasing out key tax credits. The Administration has also tried to eliminate research grants to universities on energy and climate. Second, the Administration has declared war on the public servants who are responsible for implementing and enforcing environmental laws. Key agencies have been left in tatters. Lower courts have tried to push back against much of this. Their effort to rein in the Administration have been hampered by Supreme Court rulings on the shadow docket, which have made getting into court and obtaining an adequate remedy more difficult.

The structural damage has been accompanied by a host of other assaults on the environment. As expected, Trump withdrew from the Paris Agreement. He also bludgeoned other countries into postponing carbon limits on international shipping. In the domestic sphere, Trump has torn down the regulations that have guided environmental reviews for almost fifty years. He has canceled permits for clean energy projects and used claims of emergency powers to accelerate production and use of fossil fuels. The federal government now seems to be moving in the wrong direction with great speed and determination.

Yet all is not gloom and doom for the environment. Globally, clean energy is continuing to grow very quickly. The U.S. is increasingly out of the mainstream. Here at home, lower courts have continued to push back against Trump’s executive overreach. The oral argument in the tariff case suggests that the Supreme Court may also do so. State governments have continued to pursue their own environmental and energy policies regardless of Trump. And Trump seems not to have won broad popular support for his approach to governance.

In short, it’s been a “dark and stormy night,”as the clichéd story beginning goes. But rays of moonlight are peeking through the clouds. Let’s hope for the best in 2026.",https://legal-planet.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/East_Wing_demolition.jpg,N,,2025-12-31 11:58:11.980685

“As state legislators, we encourage the EPA and Army Corps to listen to Americans who are demanding strong water protections,” the legislators wrote.
“The proposed rule falls short of meeting the needs and protections of communities, ecosystems, and waterways across the United States.
We strongly urge the EPA and U.S. Army Corps not to pursue the proposed rule to update the WOTUS definition and to retain current protections for our waterways.”","HARTFORD, CT — Five Connecticut legislators, including Senate Majority Leader Bob Duff, D-Norwalk, are among the more than 100 state legislators from 29 states that have called on the Environmental Protection Agency and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to reject a proposed rule that could eliminate protections for more than 80% of the nation’s wetlands and waterways.

In the letter, which was signed by Duff, Deputy Senate President Julie Kushner, D-Danbury, and state representatives Aimee Berger-Girvalo, D-Ridgefield, Anne Hughes, D-Easton, and Geraldo Reyes, D-Waterbury, the legislators called on EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin and Lieutenant General William Graham to retain current protections under the “Waters of the United States” rule rather than endorse the proposed rollback.

“It’s hard to fathom why the Trump administration has proposed to strip away the federal safeguards that protect American waterways and wetlands, especially given polls show near-universal support for preserving our nation’s water resources,” Duff said. “Here in Connecticut, we recognize how essential these protections are to our public health and our economy. That’s why we’ve been a leader in adopting strong environmental policies.”

Legislators who signed the letter stressed that clean water protections are critical to preserving safe drinking water for millions of Americans. Protections for streams, rivers, and lakes enjoy overwhelming public support, with 94% of Americans saying such protections are essential, according to a 2024 poll by Morning Consult for the Walton Family Foundation.

“Robust clean water protections are also critical to prevent loss of clean and safe water; the proposed rule would roll back these protections, thereby threatening the health and safety of our constituents,” they wrote.

Other benefits of protected waterways include protection from flooding and hunting and fishing and outdoor opportunities that bring significant savings and revenue, they wrote.

“Research highlighted by NOAA showed that coastal wetlands save communities $23 billion each year in storm protections, and in 2018 alone, anglers generated more than $72 billion in sales impacts and supported 470,000 U.S. jobs,” the legislators said.

The change would also place greater burdens on state governments, which would be forced to assume responsibility for protecting wetlands and waterways without additional resources or the legal authority to manage the new role, according to the group.

“As state legislators, we encourage the EPA and Army Corps to listen to Americans who are demanding strong water protections,” the legislators wrote. “The proposed rule falls short of meeting the needs and protections of communities, ecosystems, and waterways across the United States.

The projects, six of which are located in disadvantaged communities, were selected by NYSERDA to participate, subject to successful execution of contracts, in the Building Cleaner Communities Competition or the Commercial and Industrial Carbon Challenge. Today’s announcement advances community and economic development across New York State while reducing energy usage, increasing comfort, and promoting cleaner air and environment.

“These innovative projects will make a significant impact across New York State by redefining how our buildings and infrastructure are designed, operated, and powered,” NYSERDA President and CEO Doreen M. Harris said, “By upgrading existing structures with energy efficient technologies and advancing clean energy construction, New York is leading our communities toward a cleaner and healthier future.”

Commercial and Industrial Carbon Challenge Awards

The Commercial and Industrial (C&I) Carbon Challenge is a competitive program that provides funding to large energy users such as manufacturers, colleges, universities, health care facilities, and office building owners in New York State to implement clean energy projects that reduce carbon emissions. Projects may utilize a combination of energy or manufacturing process efficiency strategies, carbon capture technology, low-carbon fuel utilization, renewable generation, or energy storage.

NYSERDA awarded over $5 million for two projects located in the Finger Lakes and Capital Region:

• Finger Lakes Health will implement seven greenhouse gas emissions reduction projects over the next three years at Geneva General Hospital in Geneva and Soldiers and Sailors Memorial Hospital in Penn Yan, replacing aging systems, improving HVAC system resilience, and reducing energy use.

• The Saratoga County Sewer District will modify existing processes at the County’s existing wastewater treatment plant to provide a long-term, cost-saving solution for biosolids management that produces renewable fuels and reduces the environmental impact of operations.

“Sustainable building practices are key elements in the state’s economic, energy and environmental future,” New York Secretary of State Walter T. Mosley said, “Our partnership with NYSERDA on our Downtown Revitalization Initiative and the State Energy Plan is creating green buildings and projects throughout the State, and our mutual commitment to communities identified as disadvantaged further ensures that our transition to a green economy is both just and equitable. We look forward to expanding that partnership into the future as we implement the Governor’s visionary and practical energy goals.”

The announcement builds on the success of these two programs. Through the Building Cleaner Communities Competition, 70 projects have leveraged nearly $1.3 billion in public and private investment since 2018 to implement carbon neutral or net zero energy performance solutions. Through the C&I Carbon Challenge since 2018, NYSERDA has made awards that will cumulatively reduce 7.2 million metric tons of carbon dioxide, the equivalent of removing more than 1 million cars from the road annually.

Funding for this program was included in the 2025 Regional Economic Development Council Initiative. The REDC process continues to support and empower regional stakeholders in developing strategic plans and funding priorities that meet local economic needs. Regional Councils reviewed projects from this program and provided scores that reflect how well a project aligns with a region’s goals and strategies.

1. A fantastic distribution

Investors haven't experienced the full brunt of Energy Transfer's sell-off in 2025. There's a simple reason why. The limited partnership (LP) pays a distribution yield of roughly 8.2%.

Even better, Energy Transfer's distribution is growing. The LP announced a distribution increase in each of the first three quarters of 2025. Most recently, it boosted the distribution by 3.1% year-over-year in October.

I expect those distribution hikes to continue. Energy Transfer is targeting annual distribution growth of between 3% and 5%. That goal seems attainable, especially considering the LP boasts the strongest financial position in its history. The debt load shouldn't be a problem, given Energy Transfer's leverage ratios, which are in the lower half of its target range of 4.0x to 4.5x.

Energy Transfer's third-quarter statistics underscore just how well-positioned the midstream company is to keep raising its distributions. Distributable cash flow was roughly $1.89 billion, while distributions to partners were $1.14 billion. That translates to a comfortable distribution coverage ratio of 60%.

2. Solid growth prospects

Don't let the disappointing 2025 performance fool you. Energy Transfer continues to have solid long-term growth prospects.

The ongoing data center boom, fueled by the increased adoption of artificial intelligence (AI), is a particularly important growth driver. For example, in recent months, Energy Transfer announced agreements with Oracle (ORCL 0.47%) to supply around 900 million cubic feet per day of natural gas to three of its U.S. data centers. The LP also announced a 10-year deal with Fermi America (FRMI 0.62%) to provide gas to its next-generation AI hypergrid campus located near Amarillo, Texas.

The growth opportunities aren't limited to the U.S. Energy Transfer's total natural gas liquids (NGL) exports jumped 13% in the third quarter of 2025, setting a new record for the LP.

Energy Transfer has a robust project backlog to capitalize on its growth opportunities. Two natural gas processing plants in the Midland Basin are expected to launch in 2026. The midstream leader also has several natural gas and NGL pipeline expansion projects underway, as well as expansions to its Price River crude oil terminal.

3. An attractive valuation

Investors won't have to pay a premium to enjoy the fantastic distributions and solid growth prospects that Energy Transfer offers. The LP's valuation is quite attractive.

Energy Transfer's units trade at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of only 10.3. This multiple compares favorably with other top midstream energy stocks. For example, Enterprise Products Partners' (EPD 0.84%) and MPLX's (MPLX 0.80%) forward earnings multiples are 11.1 and 11.3, respectively. Rivals such as Enbridge (ENB 0.44%), Kinder Morgan (KMI 0.62%), and The Williams Companies (WMB 0.61%) have much higher forward price-to-earnings ratios than Energy Transfer.

Management pointed out Energy Transfer's attractive valuation in the third-quarter investor presentation. The LP's trailing 12-month enterprise value to EBITDA ratio at the time of the presentation in early November 2025 ranked second-lowest among a peer group that included nine other companies.

Unsurprisingly, the management team has invested heavily in Energy Transfer with their own money. Around 10% of units are owned by insiders, a much higher ratio than the averages for the energy sector, the midstream energy industry, and the S&P 500.",https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Feditorial%2Fimages%2F848890%2Fpipeline-welder.jpg&w=1200&op=resize,N,,2025-12-31 10:59:14.689361

A Dec. 18 report by ReImagine Appalachia has found that more than 61,000 projected clean energy jobs throughout the Appalachian region are now at risk thanks to “dramatic policy shifts” by the second Trump administration.

The study, titled “Tracking the Appalachian Impacts: What’s on the Line as Federal Funding Flatlines,” revealed that clean energy job numbers have fallen off throughout Ohio, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Kentucky, following a prolonged period of historic growth. This information has threatened what the study calls “transformative economic opportunities” throughout the Appalachian region, according to research associate and report co-author Rike Rothenstein.

“The data tells a stark story,” says Rothenstein. “Clean energy manufacturing grew from nearly nothing in 2018 to substantial investments by 2023, with 72% going to battery manufacturing and 19% to zero-emissions vehicles. But the momentum has stopped. Federal clean energy investments waned dramatically as President Trump took office for his second term, and the proposed One Big Beautiful Bill Act threatens to dismantle remaining programs entirely.”

Specifically, Rothenstein cited a canceled furnace upgrade at a Cleveland-Cliffs steel plant in Middletown, Ohio, as well as a stalled solar project in Nicholas County, West Virginia as Appalachian casualties of President Trump’s energy policies.

By the numbers

The report found that at their peak in Q3 2024, clean energy investments sat at $4.7 billion for the quarter. That number dropped to $3.8 billion by Q1 2025, and continued flatlining throughout the second and third quarters of the year. Energy and industrial expenditures also dropped 65% from their peak, down to $445 million. But perhaps the clearest indication of policy changes between the Biden administration and the second Trump administration was the projection that 67% of projected clean energy jobs are now at risk throughout the region.

“What’s particularly devastating is that the majority of threatened jobs are in construction and manufacturing, exactly the kind of blue-collar work our communities need,” said report co-author and ReImagine Appalachia Program Director Dana Kuhnline. “These investments were targeting places like Appalachia that have been left behind. The chaotic efforts to dismantle them will have particularly devastating impacts here, raising residential energy prices, sabotaging job creation, and ceding America’s leadership in clean energy to foreign competitors.”

By 2035, the region could lose an estimated 71,000 clean energy jobs across the four-state area thanks in part to President Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA)’s tax credit changes.

Federal funding for clean energy also decreased around the region, which reversed course from “historic climate legislation” over the past decade, according to the report’s co-authors.

Beyond Appalachia

The Appalachian region isn’t alone in its recent clean energy struggles, with national data from the U.S. Federal Reserve showing that private clean energy construction spending has plateaued at $240 billion as of mid-2024.

“In less than a year, we have seen the historic growth of the clean energy and manufacturing sectors drop to a flat line,” says the report. “Our region was set to create 92,282 jobs because of clean energy investments. Now those opportunities are vanishing before our eyes.”

The damage is also showing in federal agencies including the U.S. Department of Energy. The full scale of the impact on federal employees and federal agency infrastructure is “too massive to detail,” according to the report, but President Trump’s executive orders to slash tax credits for solar power projects are a chief reason for the damage.

“The agency has been key to U.S. global leadership in research, establishing programs to expand clean energy and manufacturing, and has also ensured that traditional energy communities, including Appalachia, have access to these new opportunities,” says the report. “All of this has been put at risk due to Trump administration actions.”

Trump also signed an executive order earlier this year which directed federal agencies to “stop approving permits for wind energy projects,” but a district court struck that particular order down in December 2025. Still, more than $23 billion in DOE-awarded clean energy project funding is on the line, putting a total of 330,000 jobs at risk, says the report.

“We documented $9.85 billion in energy and industry investments, $18.8 billion in clean energy manufacturing, and $22.3 billion in retail purchases of clean technologies since 2022,” says Diana Polson, report co-author. “These were transforming our communities, creating good-paying jobs that don’t require college degrees. Now we’re watching those opportunities slip away as federal funding flatlines.”

By looking at a huge colossal offshore wind project set to yield maximal results by the end of 2026, Virginia is looking at produce clean power by using a concept as simple as turning water and air into energy. Should the state realize its goal of achieving 2.6 GW of energy by 2026, it would have found the easiest route to find an alternative form of energy to assist with the grid woes.

Offshore wind energy makes electricity possible

The state is focusing on a wind energy project where the kinetic force of mechanical air will be turned into mechanical rotation, causing the generator to produce energy. Attention has been devoted to offshore wind projects as these projects enjoy stronger and more constant winds than onshore projects. Since the ocean offers this advantage, the Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind (CVOW) project can capture the natural wind.

With 176 turbines spinning simultaneously for this project, power can be provided to over 660,000 homes. With water, the offshore wind system gets powered by itself. Through the project, 2.6 GW of power can be generated, making the project a simple one whereby water and air work together.

A big wind project is almost completed

According to Dominion Energy, EVOW progress remains on track despite many mentioned setbacks. Project costs are standing at $11.2 billion and with all imported tarrifs the cost will increase about $690 million. For this project Dominion Energy enjoys an equal partnership with Stonepeak. Thus far, onshore work is progressing rather steadily. Between 2024 to 2026, all offshore work will be well underway with the assistance from workers in Virginia.

Data center requests have led to 17 GW of new delivery requests in 2025 with Dominion serving the biggest concentration of server farms.

Offshore wind project resulting in savings on fuel

With this offshore wind energy project, Dominion is expecting more than just the delivery of electrons. Wiith over $3 billion of savings during the first 10 years of CVOW operation, the advantages of this project is clear. With the anticipated savings, over 1,000 jobs were created. Energy realiability is also promoted. Dominion’s CEO, Robert Blue, asserted that putting a stop to the project would result in energy inflation.

In this state in America, the ocean is becoming a power plant and very soon 2,600,000 kW will become available to light up 660,000 homes by 2026. This massive development is taking place merely 27 miles off the coast of Virginia Beach.

CVOW is focusing on capitalizing on solar projects

Since the CVOW project is closer to completion, Virginia is proving that clean power can be derieved from merely air and the ocean. Despite the broader $50 billion investment plan for CVOW, Dominion is approaching the addition of a new reactor construction with added caution. Although Dominion is rather cautious, this project in Virginia is setting the tone for America’s renewable energy plans. Increasing the capacity of installed wind turbines in America could have a variety of advantages for the country, including that of strenghtens the economy considerably while ensuring revenue growth, and the diversification of Virginia’s eclectic energy mix.

Air and water have proven to be essential engines for the new renewable energy agenda. The good news is that both air and water are the most abundant resources on Earth so, Virginia has chosen wisely in terms of switching to the most well-known form of clean energy transfers ever. The project symbolizes so much more than just power, but very soon 2,600 MW will rise from the Atlantic as the new steel sets the stage for this highly unconventional project.

But if flying cars scale beyond boutique volumes, analysts say Detroit’s manufacturing expertise becomes hard to ignore.
“That’s where Michigan historically excels.” Detroit’s Next Mobility Test Flying cars may represent Detroit’s next mobility stress test, similar to earlier transitions involving hybrids, EVs, autonomy, and connected vehicles.
But each successful test flight—each viral video—pushes the industry one step further from fantasy and closer to function.
What matters now is not whether flying cars arrive overnight, but who helps build them when they do.","The video arrives at a moment when flying cars and closely related electric vertical takeoff and landing aircraft—known as eVTOLs—are moving out of concept art and into early test programs. Advances in battery energy density, electric propulsion, lightweight materials, and AI-assisted flight controls have quietly reshaped what is technically possible.

But the bigger question, especially in Michigan, is no longer whether flying cars can work. It’s whether Detroit will be part of what comes next.

A Growing Field Beyond the Viral Clip

The startup behind the video is only one player in a rapidly expanding field.

One of the most visible entrants is Alef Aeronautics, whose Model A is designed to be both street-legal and capable of vertical flight. Alef’s approach avoids runways entirely, positioning the vehicle as a hybrid between an EV and a personal aircraft. The company has said it is targeting early customer deliveries following expanded testing and regulatory review.

“Alef is interesting because it’s trying to meet consumers where they already are—on roads,” said Richard Aboulafia, managing director at aerospace consultancy AeroDynamic Advisory. “That’s ambitious, but it also means solving two regulatory problems instead of one.”

Other companies are taking different routes.

Samson Sky is betting on transformation rather than vertical lift. Its Switchblade converts from a road vehicle into a fixed-wing aircraft in minutes, trading VTOL complexity for longer range and higher cruise speeds—at the cost of needing a runway.

Meanwhile, ASKA is targeting a broader footprint. Its four-seat ASKA A5 uses a hybrid propulsion system and fold-out wings, aiming for family and commercial use cases rather than individual pilots.

“These aren’t all flying cars in the Jetsons sense,” said Seth Goldstein, equity strategist at Morningstar. “Some are closer to airplanes that can drive. Others are cars that can fly briefly. The market hasn’t decided which definition will win.”

eVTOLs: The Adjacent Market Moving Faster

While roadable flying cars grab headlines, many analysts believe eVTOL aircraft—vehicles that never touch public roads—may reach scale sooner.

Startups like Doroni Aerospace are focusing on short-range personal flight, with simplified controls and fully electric propulsion. These vehicles bypass automotive regulations altogether, focusing instead on FAA certification and controlled airspace operations.

“Urban air mobility is where the near-term revenue is,” said Aboulafia. “Flying cars are compelling, but air taxis and personal eVTOLs may get approved first because the use cases are narrower.”

Are Flying Cars a Threat to Michigan’s Auto Industry?

At first glance, flying cars might appear to threaten Michigan’s auto dominance. Many of the most advanced prototypes are emerging from California, Europe, and Asia—not Detroit. And aviation startups operate under a very different regulatory and cultural framework than traditional automakers.

But most analysts see overlap, not displacement.

“The technology stack is almost identical to EVs,” said Goldstein. “Electric motors, battery packs, power electronics, sensors, software. If you strip away the wings, you’re still looking at something Detroit understands extremely well.”

Automakers like General Motors and Ford Motor Company have already invested billions in electric drivetrains, autonomous systems, and advanced manufacturing—technologies that flying-car developers rely on heavily.

Where Michigan could lose ground is if flying-car startups vertically integrate, keeping high-value engineering and production in-house and bypassing traditional suppliers. But if flying cars scale beyond boutique volumes, analysts say Detroit’s manufacturing expertise becomes hard to ignore.

“At some point, aerospace startups run into the same problem Tesla did early on—how do you build this reliably, at scale?” said Aboulafia. “That’s where Michigan historically excels.”

Detroit’s Next Mobility Test

Flying cars may represent Detroit’s next mobility stress test, similar to earlier transitions involving hybrids, EVs, autonomy, and connected vehicles.

Each shift followed a familiar pattern: skepticism, early outsiders gaining attention, then legacy players adapting—or falling behind.

“This is not an existential threat today,” said Goldstein. “But it’s a signal. Mobility is being redefined again, and the question is whether Detroit participates early or reacts late.”

For Michigan suppliers, the opportunity may come quietly. Battery enclosures, thermal management systems, lightweight composites, embedded software, and advanced sensors are already part of the state’s industrial base. Flying-car and eVTOL programs could become adjacent revenue streams, even if final assembly happens elsewhere.

The risk, analysts say, isn’t that flying cars replace automobiles. It’s that new mobility categories mature without Michigan fully plugged into the value chain.

A Slow Takeoff, Not a Sudden Leap

Despite the excitement, flying cars are unlikely to flood suburban garages anytime soon. Early vehicles will be expensive, tightly regulated, and limited to niche use cases. Infrastructure, airspace management, and public acceptance remain major hurdles.

pv magazine USA spoke with leaders from around the energy storage industry to learn more about what’s next for batteries in 2025.
“I think 2027 is more likely than 2026 for wildfire-prone regions like California to begin explicitly valuing non-flammable storage chemistries in procurement or permitting.
“Localized recycling and domestic processing will become non-negotiable if the U.S. wants its battery supply chains to stay domestic.
Since January 2025, battery storage costs have risen 56% to 69% due to Trump’s tariffs.","The energy storage industry walked a bumpy road in 2025, but eyes are turning toward 2026’s tech stack. While lithium-ion remains dominant, pressure is building for longer-duration storage, safer chemistries and more resilient supply chains in the face of AI-driven load growth, data center demand, wildfire risks and tightening domestic content rules.

pv magazine USA spoke with leaders from around the energy storage industry to learn more about what’s next for batteries in 2025.

Longer-duration storage will shift from a niche solution to a strategic necessity.

“As we look to 2026, the industry is moving toward greater technology diversity, more stable revenue models and continued cost declines that will make longer-duration battery energy storage an essential pillar of U.S. energy strategy.” – Giovanni Damato, President, CMBlu Energy, Inc.

“Future market designs must match renewable supply with industrial demand and support longer-duration storage and innovative approaches, unlocking additional revenue streams like energy arbitrage, peak shaving and congestion management.” – Matt Kennedy, Global Head of Client Transformation, IDA Ireland

“When paired with any generation that can come online quickly, long duration storage can deliver the firm reliability consumers need and expect. Fast, affordable, and firm power is on track to win on economics with the assistance of long duration storage, and that momentum isn’t slowing, no matter the political climate.” – Arvin Ganesan, CEO, Fourth Power

“As data center demand continues to surge, there’s growing recognition that we need longer-duration storage solutions and hybrid configurations that can provide the sustained backup power and grid stability these facilities require.” – Jim Spencer, President and CEO, Exus Renewables

Safety concerns could push non-flammable chemistries back into the conversation.

“I think 2027 is more likely than 2026 for wildfire-prone regions like California to begin explicitly valuing non-flammable storage chemistries in procurement or permitting. What would make things move quickly is another Moss Landing fire incident somewhere, and I think it’s a question of when, not if.” – Eugene Beh, CEO, Quino Energy

Non-lithium chemistry deployment will accelerate, though 2026 might not be its banner year.

“While 2026 may not see a dramatic shift in new battery chemistries, they are on the horizon with new manufacturing plants in the design stage.” – Steve Feinberg, President, Bluewater Battery Logistics

“The convergence of EV and storage supply chains is creating real momentum for ‘built-at-home’ solutions and non-lithium chemistries…As the U.S. steadily moves toward a circular storage economy, alternative chemistries are shifting from ‘nice-to-have’ to ‘must-have’ because they improve safety, affordability, and long-term confidence.” – Julie Royes, Vice President of Corporate Affairs, CMBlu Energy, Inc.

“A continued fall in Li-ion battery prices would be the largest bottleneck for non-lithium storage in 2026. However, there are other compelling geopolitical and supply chain reasons why cost might no longer be the biggest consideration in 2026, especially if China/Taiwan/Japan tensions continue to escalate.” – Eugene Beh, CEO, Quino Energy

Recycling and domestic processing will become a supply chain requirement, not just a sustainability move.

“Localized recycling and domestic processing will become non-negotiable if the U.S. wants its battery supply chains to stay domestic. Shipping black mass overseas for processing goes against the logic of domestic manufacturing. In 2026, the winners won’t just be the ones building cells and packs, they’ll be the ones who can close their loop locally, from materials recovery through finished batteries.” – Joe Adiletta, CEO, Volexion

“While it would be great to find a reuse value for end-of-life battery energy projects, the reality of cheaper, smaller, and safer new batteries leaves recycling as the only option for disposal.” – Steve Feinberg, President, Bluewater Battery Logistics

The value of standalone storage will be recognized.

“We’re seeing storage evolve from just being paired with solar for energy arbitrage to becoming a critical infrastructure component that enables data centers to operate on clean energy while maintaining the reliability their operations demand.” – Jim Spencer, President and CEO, Exus Renewables

Foreign Entity of Concern (FEOC) implementation will reshape sourcing strategies more than technology choices.

“The BESS supply chain is working hard to figure out the industry impact of FEOC regulations, and a variety of options will present themselves over the coming year. The good thing is that there is so much recognition that BESS is good for the grid, I have no doubt in the fact that [we] will have options and that compliance will not be a major issue.” – Chris McKissack, CEO, Fullmark Energy

“Developers now face dramatically higher construction costs from the Trump administration’s aggressive tariff policies. Since January 2025, battery storage costs have risen 56% to 69% due to Trump’s tariffs. The administration’s new FEOC regulations, which kick in starting in 2026, threaten to increase costs and complexity further.” – Michael Thomas, CEO, Cleanview

“FEOC regulations and global mineral pressures have created both uncertainty and opportunity, pushing the U.S. to take domestic manufacturing seriously and driving renewed interest in non-lithium, FEOC-safe chemistries that strengthen our energy and geopolitical position.” – Giovanni Damato, President, CMBlu Energy, Inc.

Domestic supply chains will be prerequisites for scale.

“Supply chain localization will evolve from a competitive advantage to a competitive necessity, as customers seek greater certainty around delivery timelines, domestic content compliance, and end-to-end quality control.” – Andrew Gilligan, Senior Director of Commercial Strategy, Fluence

“The companies positioned to win are those that invest now in secure, scalable supply chains and embrace the next generation of chemistries capable of meeting the country’s reliability and AI-era infrastructure needs.” – Giovanni Damato, President, CMBlu Energy, Inc.

Permitting reform plus private capital could be a strong mix.

“In 2026, I expect to see real movement on permitting and transmission reform. Smarter regulation and new grid technologies can finally unlock capacity and move clean power where it’s needed most. Add private capital to the mix, and we can build a stronger, faster grid that keeps up with America’s growing appetite for power.” – Peter Davidson, CEO and Co-Founder, Aligned Climate Capital

AI and data centers will raise the bar for what “bankable” battery performance means.

“In 2026, energy storage will be clearly recognized as one of the fastest and most affordable ways to add flexible power and capacity near high-demand areas, especially as the rapid growth of AI data centers outpaces grid capacity and traps customers in multi-year interconnection queues. In this environment, however, capacity alone is no longer enough. Customers are increasingly demanding truly bankable performance with high-density systems that can reliably execute advanced grid functions.” – Andrew Gilligan, Senior Director of Commercial Strategy, Fluence

“As the AI boom continues, there will be demand for non-lithium, non-flammable energy storage to match these needs. Lithium-ion batteries tend to degrade more rapidly than flow batteries when subjected to frequent cycling, making them less viable for data center use cases, which is why flow batteries are well suited for due to their ability to cycle multiple times a day.” – Eugene Beh, CEO, Quino Energy

“The rise of AI-driven battery management and smarter manufacturing is giving people and communities energy storage resources they can rely on when it matters most. Across regions, we’re seeing [the development of] nano-partnerships, or neighborhood-like collaborations where developers, policymakers and community leaders lift each other up and build the kind of shared strength that comes from truly showing up for one another.” – Julie Royes, Vice President of Corporate Affairs, CMBlu Energy, Inc.

In September, the Hydrogen Council, announced that more than 500 hydrogen projects worldwide had passed final investment decision, amounting to $110 billion in investment.
This represents a survival rate of roughly 30%, considering that the trade group tracked more than 1700 hydrogen project announcements in the past five years.
But the data suggests that hydrogen projects haven’t necessarily been more prone to cancellation than those for other clean energy technologies.
They estimated a further 7% of announced hydrogen production capacity was likely to enter into binding contracts, for a total of 20% — right in the heart of the Pareto zone.","Hydrogen had a grueling 2025, particularly in the United States. If we take a step back and review other technologies that are powering the energy transition, however, the data suggest that the industry’s struggles have precedent.

In September, the Hydrogen Council, announced that more than 500 hydrogen projects worldwide had passed final investment decision, amounting to $110 billion in investment. This represents a survival rate of roughly 30%, considering that the trade group tracked more than 1700 hydrogen project announcements in the past five years.

Evidence of a collapsing bubble, or in line with other energy deployment? Context is key — Mt. Fuji towers over Tokyo but would be the runt of the Himalayas — and is provided by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. The 2024 edition of the lab’s Queued Up reports, makes it clear that completion rates vary wildly by sub-sector; what might be considered normal for wind would be worrying for solar-plus-storage.

The stacked horizontal bar charts on the left represent the status at the end of 2023, of U.S. energy projects that made grid transmission interconnection requests between 2000 and 2018. The Hydrogen Council survival rates can be mapped onto the chart, with the caveat that its data is global while the LBNL dataset is for the United States only.

The 70% withdrawal rate for worldwide hydrogen projects is broadly in line with project withdrawal rates LBNL observed not just for utility-scale batteries, interconnection-seeking solar (without storage), and wind — each near 75% — but for natural gas power plants as well, at 67%. This means that even before Trump administration tribulations, most types of transmission-facing electricity projects in the United States roughly followed a version of the Pareto Principle: Rather than 20% of efforts causing 80% of results, in the energy sector it seems that roughly 20% of projects (or slightly more, depending on the sector) represent all of a sector’s success — while 80% fail to materialize.

That said, the Trump 2.0 era has certainly complicated things for hydrogen projects in the U.S., prompting some companies to move their operations abroad. In October, Latitude Media reported that Danish manufacturer Topsoe paused work on its $400 million electrolyzer facility in Virginia in light of poor demand for the green hydrogen; earlier this year, the Norwegian Nel Hydrogen decided to cancel its own planned electrolyzer factory in Michigan. And in November, Exxon announced plans to freeze development of a planned blue hydrogen plant in Texas.

These announcements, linked as they are to policy shifts in the U.S., are worrying. It’s possible, given the global nature of the Hydrogen Council data, that some companies are picking up and leaving the U.S. — but still getting their projects built elsewhere. But the data suggests that hydrogen projects haven’t necessarily been more prone to cancellation than those for other clean energy technologies.

In any industry building new infrastructure, there are startups who shut down even before reaching the announcement stage. A blunt Bluesky post by Tim Latimer, CEO and co-founder of advanced geothermal pioneer Fervo Energy, hints that an 80-20 dynamic might emerge in advanced geothermal also.

That said, hydrogen can not be compared directly to grid-connected projects. A key metric for success, as Topsoe demonstrated, is finding buyers for the electrolyzers or hydrogen that a company produces. According to BloombergNEF data, as of November 2023, only a small minority of near-term hydrogen projects — 13% of announced capacity — had announced offtakers. They estimated a further 7% of announced hydrogen production capacity was likely to enter into binding contracts, for a total of 20% — right in the heart of the Pareto zone.

Solar-plus-storage is the outlier in the LBNL dataset because of its large “active projects” bar: 37% by project count that were neither operational or withdrawn. This is likely because that sub-sector saw a rapid scale-up in the past decade. LBNL only records seven solar-plus-storage projects as requesting interconnection in 2014; in 2018, that had increased to 200; and by 2022, they counted 791 requests.

This juxtaposition of sectors begs the question of whether the Pareto principle could apply for the biggest infrastructure build-out currently underway: data centers. It will certainly take several years to know for sure, but there are a few pieces of evidence that it might.

Earlier this year, Camus Energy CEO Astrid Atkinson said that she was seeing five to 10 times as many data center transmission interconnection requests in the United States as data centers being built: phantom data centers that have complicated building timelines. At best this would amount to a Pareto-abiding 20% project completion rate.

This is not to say that this Pareto rule for successful energy- or energy-adjacent projects would be predictive. The industry’s goal, of course, should be to increase its share of successful projects, both for commercialized technologies and more nascent ones. Advanced geothermal, small modular reactors and other technologies may enjoy more success — and if they do, the reasons will deserve study.

Left-leaning groups and Democratic politicians have tied high electric bills to the Trump administration’s cuts to renewable energy funding.
At a time when electricity demand is surging from AI, renewable energy projects that relied on that funding have been canceled.","Heading into 2026, energy news is heating up in the national conversation. From surging demand from data centers powering AI to increasing electricity bills and political fights over wind and solar power, Straight Arrow News’ fact-based journalism will explore these forces throughout the year, starting with three pressing questions: How many data centers will be built? Which energy sources will win under shifting policies? And who will win the political fight over affordable electricity?.

The answers to these questions won’t just shape corporate policies; they will affect everyday life, from the price paid to keep the lights on to energy reliability during extreme weather events.

How many data centers will really be built?

Data centers dominated the news throughout 2025. The technology industry wants more computing power for artificial intelligence tools. The industry is dishing out billions in capital expenses to build massive warehouses full of computers, and Big Tech is hungry for the electricity its computers need to run.

In November, SAN reported projections of the energy requirements for planned data centers, according to real estate firm Cushman & Wakefield. The firm found that it would take 79 gigawatts of electricity to power all the planned data centers. The new demand is 40 times what the Hoover Dam generates for the grid.

Meanwhile, energy analysts at BloombergNEF estimate that by 2035, new data centers will account for about 60 gigawatts of new electricity demand. While projections vary, they all point in the same direction: Data centers will need an astronomical amount of electricity, and fast.

But SAN reporting also shows how communities around newly proposed data center sites often mount fierce opposition to construction projects. Americans are increasingly wary of how data centers could alter their neighborhoods and the potential impacts on electricity rates and water availability. Even if a lawsuit doesn’t stop a data center project, litigation can cause delays.

The year has been rife with discussion of an “AI bubble” as most of the stock market’s growth was dominated by a small group of technology companies investing heavily in artificial intelligence tools. Bubble or not, many researchers are skeptical of the projected electricity demand from data centers.

“Many data centers that are talked about and proposed and in some cases even announced will never get built,” Sean O’Leary, a senior researcher at the Ohio River Valley Institute, told SAN earlier this year.

Projections of electricity demand growth may also be inflated because technology companies can submit the same proposal to multiple utility companies across the country while intending to build in only one area. While energy analysts agree that data centers will drive more energy demand, 2026 should provide more insight into the actual size and speed of data center construction.

Which energy resources will flourish or falter?

As President Donald Trump returned to power, the new administration’s shift in policy priorities away from renewable energy became a key storyline. From day one, Trump’s executive orders put federal grant funding for renewable energy projects on hold while signaling to the oil and gas industry that he would cut red tape to make it easier to expand production.

On July 4, Trump signed the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” into law, which shortened the time wind and solar power companies have to qualify for federal tax credits. Those credits provide a taxpayer-funded payment for each unit of electricity produced by large-scale wind and solar installations. Renewable energy companies now have until 2027 or 2030 to qualify for 10 years of tax credits, depending on when construction begins.

The Trump administration also took a series of steps that hampered the offshore wind industry. Most recently, the Department of the Interior announced it would stop offering leases for offshore wind on federal waters and told five ongoing wind projects to stop construction, citing national security concerns.

Despite the rollback of many Biden-era funding mechanisms, solar power had a blockbuster year in 2025. Solar paired with batteries remains among the most cost-effective sources of electricity, according to an analysis by the U.S. Energy Information Administration, and it can be built quickly.

Natural gas will continue to account for the largest share of U.S. electricity production, and in 2025, dozens of new gas-fired power plants were proposed or approved nationwide. SAN covered the approval of three new gas power plants in Louisiana, which will be needed to power a massive data center being built by Meta.

But the growth of gas power is limited by supply chain constraints. Wait times for new gas power plant turbines have stretched to five years or more. In September, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries announced plans to double gas turbine production, and continued efforts into 2026 could speed up the timeline for expanding gas on the electric grid.

Geothermal and nuclear power enjoyed bipartisan support in 2025 because they produce zero carbon emissions and can provide electricity to the grid 24 hours a day. The year was full of milestones in this space, such as geothermal company Fervo raising $462 million in private investment and the Trump administration announcing up to $80 billion available to build Westinghouse nuclear reactors. In terms of providing large amounts of power to the grid, the fruits of these investments are likely to be realized several years from now. But if the trend continues, geothermal and nuclear power sectors will continue to gain steam in 2026.

Who will win the electricity affordability narrative?

With the 2026 midterm elections in sight, the economy — specifically how rising costs are straining millions of Americans’ budgets — is emerging as a key issue.

As SAN reported in October, rising energy prices were the largest driver of year-over-year inflation, pushing it above 3% for the first time in eight months. No doubt, Americans are feeling the squeeze from high electricity prices

In November, Florida regulators approved a $7 billion rate increase for about 6 million customers of Florida Power & Light. SAN reported how people across 41 states face approved or proposed rate increases, and both political parties have taken notice.

Left-leaning groups and Democratic politicians have tied high electric bills to the Trump administration’s cuts to renewable energy funding. At a time when electricity demand is surging from AI, renewable energy projects that relied on that funding have been canceled.

“A lot of families are going to be facing tough decisions,” Lucero Marquez, an associate director at the left-leaning Center for American Progress, told SAN earlier this year. “The consistent attack on renewables is going to hurt Americans.”

Meanwhile, Republicans and right-leaning groups say renewable energy investments are making electricity more expensive. They cite the need to back up weather-dependent energy technologies like wind and solar with other sources, like natural gas. Mario Loyola, a senior fellow at the right-leaning Heritage Foundation, told SAN in September that excessive renewable energy means customers are “paying for all this redundant power.”

Loyola also said regulations on the oil, gas and coal industry have “constrained grid capacity” and made power more expensive.

Elections in Georgia, New Jersey and Virginia in 2025 put these dueling narratives to the ultimate test: the ballot box.

If those elections are any indication, Democrats are coming out ahead. In New Jersey’s gubernatorial race, where high electricity bills were a key issue, Democrat Mikie Sherrill defeated Republican Jack Ciattarelli by 13 points. And Democrat Abigail Spanberger won the gubernatorial race in Virginia, home to the largest concentration of data centers in the U.S., where residents have also seen rising bills.

The races in Georgia were squarely focused on electricity prices. There, two Democratic challengers defeated Republican incumbents to win seats on the Georgia Public Service Commission, the board that regulates utilities. Democrats flipped traditionally Republican counties for decisive victories in a key swing state. However, the results likely had less to do with partisan affiliation and more to do with anger at incumbents who approved previous increases in electricity rates.

Daniel Tait, a director at the nonprofit utility watchdog group Energy and Policy Institute, told SAN in November, “Monopoly investor-owned utilities are deeply unpopular,” and any politician, regardless of party affiliation, could face backlash for aligning with the utility companies.

“People are just fed up with high power bills,” Tait said.",https://san.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-2198227080_Getty_Images_clean.jpg,N,,2025-12-31 10:59:56.610469

Green Methanol does not have the same issues with safety and costs associated with hydrogen fuel Hydrogen fuel must be stored and there are safety and costs associated with storing hydrogen fuel.
There are also very few, if any, existing infrastructures to support the storage and transportation of hydrogen fuel.
An estimated 500,000 tons of Green Methanol is to be produced to be used in maritime shipping.
Produce 500,000 tons of Green Methanol each year also represents reducing millions of tons of CO₂ emissions.","China’s focus on producing Green Methanol is part of the nation’s larger decarbonization vision. It utilizes wind power and direct capture from carbon to aid in that effort. Methanol is used as a fuel in many different ways including in the chemical processing industry and in the fuel for industrial shipping.

China’s enormous wind energy can be leveraged with the focus on producing Green Methanol

For years China has focused on Hydrogen as the “fuel of the future” and although Goldwind has made large investments and has committed to developing Green Methanol, the focus from Goldwind, the world’s largest wind turbine manufacturer, clearly shows a strong move from focusing on Hydrogen.

Goldwind has set a goal to manufacture 500,000 tons of Green Methanol per year and is moving into manufacturing Green Methanol. Methanol production is an exciting yet simple process. Ultra-powerful wind turbines utilize renewable energy to produce energy, CO2 is then captured from the atmosphere and stored for later use in the production of Green Methanol, and electrolysis is utilized to separate the components of H2O to include hydrogen and other component parts.

Green Methanol does not have the same issues with safety and costs associated with hydrogen fuel

Hydrogen fuel must be stored and there are safety and costs associated with storing hydrogen fuel. There are also very few, if any, existing infrastructures to support the storage and transportation of hydrogen fuel. On the other hand, Green Methanol is in liquid form under normal temperature and pressure conditions, making it safe and easy to store and transport. Additionally, Green Methanol can operate within existing fuel systems, which will help in the decarbonization of the maritime shipping industry. As such, waiting for hydrogen infrastructure development will be a lengthy process.

Affordability and decarbonizing options

Methanol is less expensive and more abundant than most other decarbonizing options. That is why Goldwind chose to focus in this area. The potential for decarbonization for China’s Chemical Industry is substantial. The shipping networks are global in nature. Through Goldwind’s Dieppe initiative, which aims to decarbonize both shipping and Methanol production, the vision appears much more attainable. An estimated 500,000 tons of Green Methanol is to be produced to be used in maritime shipping. The Green Methanol is to be produced by the wind farms Goldwind is estimating to develop in resource rich areas around the globe.

Designed for power and efficiency for all consumers

Turbines are being designed to capture energy efficiently. Operational turbines capable of functioning and sustaining load at a 6m/s wind speed (modern since 2020) are preferred. Highly controlled DAC systems capture CO2 from the atmosphere; renewable energy is utilized to reduce the carbon footprint to zero. The methanol produced through this method is highly innovative and energy efficient relative to all of the other carbon-capturing systems available today.

Will producing green methanol affect the environment?

Produce 500,000 tons of Green Methanol each year also represents reducing millions of tons of CO₂ emissions. This supports China’s commitment to peaking emissions before 2030 and achieving carbon neutrality by 2060. The project also establishes China as a leader in economical production of chemicals from renewable energy sources, particularly in the new field of clean energy technologies. Rather than a merely technological decision, China has strategically chosen Green Methanol over hydrogen.

China is creating usable, scalable, and green fuel by “mining” carbon from the air and utilizing wind power. This strategy may change the world’s priorities for energy. The image of Goldwind’s turbines turning across China’s windy plains represent the beginning of a new era. It is the era where renewable energy is not just generating electricity, but making it. It is taking the air and wind to create the building blocks of a renewable economy.",https://energiesmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/27-1-1.jpg,N,,2025-12-31 13:00:09.731412

For more than 50 years, nuclear energy has played a critical role in Georgia’s energy mix – currently providing approximately 25% of the state’s electricity each year from just two nuclear plants: Plant Hatch near Vidalia and Plant Vogtle near Augusta. The plants sit at the center of the state’s energy mix, operating efficiently and reliably for customers around the clock with an average capacity factor – the time at which they operate at full power – of 94% over the last decade. More than 1.2 billion megawatt hours of net generation have been produced by Georgia nuclear units since 1975 – enough total electricity to power the entire United States for more than 100 consecutive days.

Georgia Power and the plants’ other co-owners – Oglethorpe Power Corporation, the Municipal Electric Authority of Georgia and Dalton Utilities – are celebrating historic milestones this year for the state’s nuclear fleet. Georgia’s first nuclear power facility – Plant Hatch Unit 1 – entered commercial operation in December 1975 and marks 50 years of continuous operation this year. Additionally, the historic expansion of Plant Vogtle 3 & 4 marked the one-year anniversary of completion this past spring.

“Nuclear energy serves as the bedrock of our diverse generation fleet, ready and available when we need it, with a stable, predictable cost to operate and no air emissions,” said Kim Greene, chairman, president and CEO of Georgia Power. “We’re grateful that, well over 50 years ago, state leaders at that time recognized the value of this energy source and took steps to make sure that a growing Georgia had the energy it needed. Customers today directly benefit from that foresight. Now, as our state continues to be the economic powerhouse of the Southeast, work continues with the Georgia Public Service Commission and many other stakeholders to build on that legacy as we maintain, evolve and expand our diverse generation mix to serve customers today, and 50 years from today.”

That includes ongoing investments to modernize and maximize the company’s already high performing units, including the potential to extend operating licenses and extract additional megawatts. Southern Nuclear, which operates Plants Hatch and Vogtle on behalf of Georgia Power and the co-owners, is an industry leader in safety, innovation and performance. The company is known for innovation in nuclear energy at Georgia power plants, having consistently been awarded the most prestigious awards for developing industry-changing advancements, from digital modernization and AI application to being the first in the world to install enhanced Accident Tolerant Fuel (ATF) technologies at Plant Hatch in 2018 and the historic installation of higher-uranium-enriched fuel earlier this year at Vogtle Units 1 & 2, a significant achievement that will positively transform the fuel cycle for all existing and future nuclear reactor designs.

“Our workforce comes from a wide variety of backgrounds, including the nuclear Navy, with each individual dedicated to safely and efficiently operating these nuclear units to serve electric customers across Georgia,” said Pete Sena, chairman, president and CEO of Southern Nuclear. “The nuclear industry represents the best of American energy production, and I couldn’t be more proud to lead this team of highly skilled professionals across Southern Nuclear who work together to drive innovation and performance at our current plants, but also as we work together to grow the future of clean energy in this country.”

Southern Nuclear currently employs more than 2,600 people across Plants Hatch and Vogtle. Over the decades, the nuclear plants have provided high-quality, full-time jobs for an estimated 18,000 people.

Beyond providing jobs for thousands of people, Plants Hatch and Vogtle support vibrant and healthy local communities. Combined, the plants contribute more than $85 million in property taxes each year, which goes to support local schools, roads and other infrastructure. Plant teams also share a commitment to citizenship and community service with the plants supporting a variety of local charities and causes including STEM education efforts, the work of the United Way, multiple veterans groups and environmental/sustainability efforts.

A Bright Future for Georgia’s First Nuclear Facility

In 1975, the year Hatch Unit 1 entered service, Georgia’s population was around 5 million people and, 50 years later, that number has more than doubled with more than 11 million people now calling Georgia home. Plant Hatch has helped meet the electrical needs of that growth year after year, with its opening also marking a pivotal moment for Georgia Power’s commitment to developing a diverse, cleaner generation mix to serve customers. At the end of the 1960s, prior to the introduction of emission-free nuclear energy to Georgia Power’s generation mix, approximately 85 percent of the company’s electricity came from fossil-fuel sources including coal.

The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) granted Hatch Unit 1 an initial license to operate in 1974, with Unit 2 following in 1975. In 2002, Plant Hatch’s operating license was extended by the NRC for an additional 20 years. In 2023, Southern Nuclear began the process of seeking the NRC’s approval for subsequent license renewal of Hatch Units 1 and 2, with the formal application filed with the NRC in May 2025 (read more). This renewal would extend the operating license of both units for an additional 20 years and allow the site to continue providing the state of Georgia with clean and reliable electricity around the clock.

The Largest Generator of Clean Energy in the U.S.

Named after World War II hero, and subsequent Southern Company CEO, Alvin Vogtle, Plant Vogtle’s original Units 1 & 2 opened as Georgia’s second nuclear facility in the late 1980s. With all four units now in operation, Plant Vogtle is the largest generator of clean energy in the nation, expected to produce more than 30 million megawatt hours of electricity each year. The Vogtle 3 & 4 nuclear expansion was the first newly constructed nuclear facility in more than 30 years, and was completed in May 2024 with the commercial operation of Unit 4.

Since entering commercial operation, the new Vogtle units have performed safely and reliably at or above industry average. In September, Unit 4 successfully completed its first refueling outage and, through strategic fuel planning, Southern Nuclear was able to delay Unit 4’s first planned refueling outage until the fall, allowing it to operate during the hottest months of the year when customers needed reliable power the most.",,N,,2025-12-31 10:13:01.635662

Two significant bills failed during the last two sessions, but lawmakers say the issues aren't going away. Gov. Brian Kemp vetoed House Bill 1192, which would have paused new data center tax breaks for two years and created a commission to study the facilities' impact on the power grid.

Kemp argued the pause would undermine investments already planned by operators.

Another bill, Senate Bill 34, aimed to require data centers to pay for new power plants and transmission lines built primarily to serve them, instead of shifting those costs onto households and small businesses. The bill passed the Senate Utilities Committee but died in the Senate Rules Committee and never reached a floor vote.

Georgia Power projects that data centers will account for roughly 90% of new energy demand by the early 2030s, requiring approximately 3,300 megawatts of new capacity. Consumer advocates worry residential customers will absorb those costs through higher monthly bills.

Stephanie Deaton, who grew up in Monroe County, says the rapid growth threatens the small-town character of her community.

""What I don't support is fast growth, and what I would love to see our representatives and senators do is to just take a pause just to understand things a little bit better,"" Deaton said.

She says it’s the fight of her generation.

""Don't look at it just from the financial side, look at it from our civil rights and actually representing the people that you're supposed to,"" Deaton said. ""The people in place that are supposed to protect us, I don't feel like they really are.""

Deaton is working with Rep. Steven Sainz on legislation focused on data privacy rights, hoping to limit how data center companies profit from personal information.

The Environmental Protection Agency says its proposal to stop greenhouse gas reporting for big polluters could save oil and gas companies up to $256 million a year. Some of them are countering that it could hurt their business instead.

Companies, industry trade groups and other energy experts warn that axing the more than a decade-old Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program could immediately jeopardize oil and gas firms’ ability to claim highly valued tax credits. It could also hurt companies selling liquefied natural gas, or LNG, to Asia and Europe in the future, they say, where less carbon-intensive energy sources are increasingly more desirable.

Halting emissions reporting introduces “significant uncertainty for producers” and “unnecessary complexity into programs that are critical for deploying the very solutions needed to meet energy and climate goals,” said Dustin Meyer, a senior vice president at the American Petroleum Institute, in public testimony at an EPA October hearing on the proposal.

API, which has nearly 600 members including Chevron Corp and Exxon Mobil Corp., is a major industry group pushing to keep the program, which requires the nation’s biggest industrial polluters to calculate and report their annual greenhouse gas emissions every year. Exxon declined to comment on the proposal. Chevron, meanwhile, did not respond to requests for comment.

This reporting program “has no material impact on improving human health and the environment,” said an EPA spokesperson in an email, and killing it would allow companies more space to put their money on activities with “actual, tangible environmental impacts.”

The data it collects represents the the nation’s main record of large industrial emissions, which is publicly accessible online. It underpins US tax credits claims designed to incentivize capturing and storing carbon dioxide underground, rather than releasing it into the atmosphere where it contributes to global warming. It’s also used by states to track progress on their climate goals, by investors to inform decisions on energy ventures and by advocates to educate communities on nearby pollution sources.

EPA is proposing to stop requiring most sources to submit this data, and to suspend collecting it for certain oil and gas sources until 2034. Of the roughly 8,000 industrial facilities and suppliers nationwide required to report emissions now, nearly 2,300 of them were oil and gas operators. In 2023, they collectively recorded 322 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent, according to the agency’s latest available data. That’s the same amount of pollution as produced by driving 75 million gasoline-powered vehicles for a year.

“Rolling back or delaying federal reporting 10 years would not reduce the burden — it would create regulatory whiplash when these rules come back,” said Lindsay Larrick, chief legal and administrative officer for natural gas producer BKV Corporation, in a public comment posted online Tuesday.

In the absence of a federal program, states will step in to fill the void, Larrick added, noting this will be “extremely costly” and create “additional burden” to operators working across state lines.

Taxpayers, meanwhile, wouldn’t be able to claim the carbon capture tax credit, known as 45Q, said Jessie Stolark, executive director of the Carbon Capture Coalition, a collaboration of companies, unions, and environmental groups that includes Shell PLC and Occidental Petroleum Corp. In order to do so, companies must reference the volumes of stored CO2 reported to the EPA, she added.

The more emissions a company stores underground, the greater the credit that they can claim.

“The EPA failed to consider that the economic benefits [from the program’s carbon capture data] far outweigh the cost to the respondents of reporting,” said Keith Tracy, chief commercial officer of Elysian Carbon Management, in public comments posted online this week. Elysian Carbon Management is a carbon capture, transport and storage development company owned by Buckeye Partners, one of the largest oil products pipeline operators.

Although the exact number of companies that have claimed the credit and the amount they’ve received are not publicly available, the Carbon Capture Coalition estimates developers relying on it have already invested $77.5 billion in carbon capture projects. Oil and gas companies are partners in many of the carbon capture projects that qualify for these tax credits, Stolark said.

Companies looking to claim another tax credit, for clean hydrogen, also rely on this data, according to Drew Monroe, senior associate at the strategy firm Capstone LLC. Hydrogen can come from different sources. So-called “blue hydrogen,” which is produced from natural gas with carbon capture, qualifies for the credit, called 45V. But currently, the only way producers can prove this hydrogen type has a low-enough carbon footprint to get a higher tax credit value is through the EPA reporting program, he said.

In response to questions about potential tax credit impacts, the EPA said it welcomes public comments through Nov. 3. The Treasury Department did not respond to requests for comment.

In the coming years the absence of emissions data could also hurt the LNG industry. That’s because the European Union has put in place measures to limit methane emissions from all energy imports, including LNG, which importers will need to document. The US has stepped up its LNG exports to Europe following the invasion of Ukraine in 2022 and Europe’s declining reliance on Russian pipeline gas. While the final European methane standards are not yet defined, American exporters have been keenly following how to best supply the fuel and provide emissions data around LNG cargoes.

Japan is similarly looking to verify emissions from its LNG imports. The US was the third largest exporter to Japan in 2024, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

“There will be ripple effects,” said former EPA official Jeff Cohen, who co-founded Xpansiv, a market platform for trading carbon credits and other environmental commodities. “This is a foundational reporting program that companies, banks, importers, exporters, local communities have been relying on for 15 years.”

Abstract: A Thermistor for Windshield Sprayer Circuit is a modification to a motor vehicle spray circuit that prevents utilization of the circuit in freezing temperatures. The device utilizes a thermistor that is connected between the main positive voltage, typically +12 VDC in a motor vehicle, and bias resistors that drive a transistor. When temperatures are high enough, envisioned to be above forty degrees Fahrenheit (40 F.), the thermistor presents an open circuit that does not interfere with the operation of the circuit. When temperatures are low enough, envisioned to be below forty degrees Fahrenheit (40 F.), the thermistor presents a closed circuit that does not allow the circuit, as well as the washer pump, to operate. The device would be used on an emergency vehicle equipped with an underbody spray system that uses the windshield system to spray dry vegetation under the vehicle to prevent fires.

Assignee(s): Radian Memory Systems, LLC (Plano, TX)

Law Firm: No Counsel

Application No., Date, Speed: 18887855 on 09/17/2024 (434 days app to issue)

Abstract: This disclosure provides for host-controller cooperation in managing NAND flash memory. The controller maintains information for each erase unit which tracks memory usage. This information assists the host in making decisions about specific operations, for example, initiating garbage collection, space reclamation, wear leveling or other operations. For example, metadata can be provided to the host identifying whether each page of an erase unit has been released, and the host can specifically then command each of consolidation and erase using direct addressing. By redefining host-controller responsibilities in this manner, much of the overhead association with FTL functions can be substantially removed from the memory controller, with the host directly specifying physical addresses. This reduces performance unpredictability and overhead, thereby facilitating integration of solid state drives (SSDs) with other forms of storage. The disclosed techniques are especially useful for direct-attached and/or network-attached storage.

“After over a decade of challenges and obstacles, our promise that we will not only cleanup this land, but revitalize this community and begin construction, is being fulfilled,” said Guy A. Medaglia, President and CEO of CSDC. “We look forward to providing much needed green space and an economic boost to the Southwest Side.”

The first stage in the cleanup included the removal of old concrete and soil, exposing buried foundations from previous structures, sub grading areas for future paving and drainage, and installing clean soil and erosion control systems.

Nearly 44,000 tons of toxic soil have been safely removed from the land after several rounds of testing determined what contamination existed. Additionally, two abandoned underground storage tanks were discovered. These tanks were properly removed under the supervision of a health inspector.

The land remediation was performed by Tecnica Environmental Services and was funded by CSDC through capital funds and federal grants awarded by the United States Environmental Protection Agency.

Phase Two of the cleanup will begin once CSDC secures an approved Remedial Action Plan from the IL EPA, which is anticipated to commence in spring or summer 2026.

With a design from HDR, the new campus will facilitate the future construction of multiple buildings. The main anchor will be a new 12-story building for Saint Anthony’s Hospital that will rise 240 feet. In addition, the site will deliver a medical office building, central utility plant (CUP), commercial and retail space, outdoor athletic fields, a vocational school, surgical center, daycare, and office. A total of 1,245 parking spaces are proposed for the site, with most located in a large parking structure that will have the athletic fields topping it.

The change eliminates the existing 6% sales tax on gasoline and replaces it with a higher, flat per-gallon fuel tax.

The state fuel tax rate will increase from approximately 31 cents to 52.4 cents per gallon, a difference of about 21 cents. However, the net impact on drivers at the pump is expected to be a much smaller increase of around 1.4 cents per gallon, as the sales tax is simultaneously removed.

Key Details of the New Legislation:

-Dedicated Funding: Unlike the previous system where only a small portion of the sales tax went to roads (with most going to schools and general funds), all revenue from the new fuel tax will be deposited into the Michigan Transportation Fund for infrastructure projects.

-Inflation Adjustment: Starting in 2026, the fuel tax will be adjusted annually for inflation, which could lead to gradual rate increases over time.

-Price Point Impact: The effective tax burden for drivers will depend on the price of gas. At a price of roughly $3.50 per gallon, the total tax impact is about the same as the old system. When gas prices fall below this point, drivers will pay slightly more in total taxes, and when prices rise above it, they will pay slightly less.

-EV Fees Increase: Owners of electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles will also see higher annual registration fees to ensure they contribute to road funding, with increases of about $100 for fully electric vehicles and $50 for plug-in hybrids.

Lawmakers say the change will provide a stable, long-term funding source expected to generate an estimated $1.05 billion in the first full year for the state’s long-neglected infrastructure, a key promise of Governor Gretchen Whitmer’s administration.

India's critical minerals strategy represents one of the most comprehensive attempts by a major economy to achieve strategic autonomy in critical material supply chains.","What Drives India's Critical Minerals Independence Initiative?

Strategic autonomy in the 21st century hinges not on conventional military assets, but on access to the materials that power modern technology. For India, this reality has crystallized into an urgent imperative to reduce catastrophic dependencies on foreign mineral supplies that underpin everything from renewable energy infrastructure to defense systems. Understanding India's critical minerals strategy becomes essential for evaluating the country's economic security and technological sovereignty.

Economic Security Through Resource Diversification

India's mineral import dependencies reveal vulnerabilities that extend far beyond simple cost considerations. The country currently imports 100% of its lithium requirements, sourcing primarily from Australia, Chile, and Argentina to meet growing demand from battery manufacturing and energy storage applications. Similarly, cobalt imports account for 100% of domestic consumption, with the Democratic Republic of Congo, Russia, and China serving as primary suppliers.

Perhaps most concerning is India's 80% import dependency for rare earth elements, with China controlling approximately 70% of global rare earth processing capacity. This concentration risk became starkly apparent during the 2010 rare earth export restrictions, when dysprosium prices surged from USD $80-100 per kilogram to USD $400-500 per kilogram within 12 months, directly impacting wind turbine magnet production worldwide.

The economic implications extend beyond immediate procurement costs. During geopolitical tensions, critical mineral prices can fluctuate 40-60% within six-month periods, as demonstrated by dysprosium and terbium volatility during U.S.-China trade disputes in 2020. For India's manufacturing sector, such price instability creates planning uncertainty and competitive disadvantages.

To address these vulnerabilities, the government has allocated ₹34,300 crore (approximately USD $4.1 billion) to the National Critical Minerals Mission over the 2023-2030 period. This investment represents recognition that mineral security requires sustained, long-term capital deployment rather than reactive procurement strategies.

Strategic Autonomy in Energy Transition

India's net-zero commitments by 2070 demand unprecedented mineral inputs for renewable energy infrastructure. The country's renewable energy capacity is projected to reach 500 GW by 2030, up from approximately 180 GW in 2024. This expansion implies a lithium requirement of 2.7-3.2 million tonnes over the 2025-2030 period to support battery manufacturing for grid-scale energy storage and electric vehicles.

Furthermore, the role of minerals in energy transition becomes particularly crucial when examining defense sector dependencies. Critical minerals are essential for advanced military technologies, including:

Permanent magnets (neodymium, dysprosium, terbium) for radar systems and missile guidance

Lithium for battery systems in submarines and portable defense electronics

Cobalt for aerospace turbine alloys and hardened armor systems

The manufacturing competitiveness dimension cannot be overlooked. India's target of 30% electric vehicle penetration by 2030 implies 8.5-10 million EVs annually, each requiring 40-80 kg of lithium-ion battery content. This represents total lithium demand of 340,000-800,000 tonnes over the five-year period, assuming domestic manufacturing captures significant market share.

Without secure mineral supply chains, India risks remaining a component assembler rather than developing integrated manufacturing capabilities in critical clean energy technologies.

How Does India's Domestic Resource Potential Compare Globally?

While India's critical mineral import dependencies appear daunting, the country possesses significant untapped geological potential that could reshape its strategic position. However, realising this potential requires honest assessment of both opportunities and constraints compared to established global suppliers.

Geological Asset Mapping and Untapped Reserves

India's mineral endowment reveals a complex picture of substantial reserves distributed across challenging locations. For rare earth elements, India ranks as the 4th largest reserve holder globally with estimated reserves of 6-7 million tonnes, primarily concentrated in Chhattisgarh and Odisha states.

Mineral Current Import Dependency Known Domestic Reserves Exploration Status Lithium 100% 0.2-0.3 million tonnes (Northeast) <20% explored Cobalt 100% ~0.05 million tonnes (estimated) Limited exploration Rare Earth Elements 80% from China 6-7 million tonnes Fragmented development Graphite High 0.8-1.2 million tonnes Regional variations

Northeast India, particularly Ladakh and Jammu & Kashmir, contains lithium-bearing pegmatite deposits with lithium oxide concentrations of 0.5-1.2% in select formations. However, these reserves remain largely unexplored, with less than 20% drilling completion according to Geological Survey of India assessments.

Chhattisgarh hosts monazite-bearing deposits with estimated rare earth reserves of 2-3 million tonnes, primarily light rare earth elements including lanthanum, cerium, and neodymium. The Bailadila region presents particularly interesting potential for co-extraction with existing iron ore operations, potentially reducing infrastructure development costs.

For graphite, India's 0.8-1.2 million tonnes of reserves are concentrated in Odisha, with scattered deposits across Karnataka and Chhattisgarh. Given projected 12-15% annual demand growth through 2030 for battery anode applications, these domestic resources could serve significant portions of India's requirements.

Technical Challenges in Domestic Extraction

The technical complexity of developing India's critical mineral resources extends well beyond simple extraction. Northeast lithium deposits require pegmatitic processing involving crushing, flotation separation, and roasting at 1000-1200°C followed by acid leaching. These processes are significantly more capital-intensive than evaporative extraction methods used in South American brine deposits.

Cost comparisons reveal the challenge:

Australia (Greenbushes spodumene): USD $8,000-10,000 per tonne lithium carbonate equivalent production cost

Chile (Atacama brine evaporation): USD $4,000-6,000 per tonne lithium carbonate equivalent production cost

India (estimated pegmatitic hard-rock): USD $12,000-15,000 per tonne lithium carbonate equivalent production cost

Rare earth element extraction presents additional complications. Monazite ores, typical of Indian deposits, contain 4-8% thorium by weight, requiring radioactive waste management protocols. Processing yields typically reach 60-75% for individual rare earth elements, with remaining material becoming radioactive tailings requiring long-term storage solutions.

Environmental clearance frameworks add temporal and regulatory complexity. Current permitting timelines average 18-24 months for critical mineral projects, though the government targets reduction to 12 months through single-window clearance mechanisms.

Infrastructure requirements for remote mining locations compound development challenges. Accessing Northeast lithium deposits requires road and rail connectivity in high-altitude, ecologically sensitive zones where water availability for processing operations remains uncertain. Processing water requirements of 500-2,000 litres per tonne of ore create potential conflicts with agricultural and domestic water needs in water-stressed regions.

What Are the Key Components of India's Multi-Pronged Strategy?

India's approach to critical mineral security operates across multiple simultaneous tracks, recognising that no single solution can address the scale and urgency of the challenge. This strategy combines domestic resource development, international partnerships, and supply chain resilience measures.

Domestic Exploration and Mining Acceleration

The National Critical Minerals Mission encompasses over 1,200 exploration projects targeting lithium, cobalt, rare earths, and graphite deposits across India. This represents the most comprehensive domestic mineral exploration programme in the country's post-independence history.

Under the amended Mines and Minerals Development and Regulation Act of 2023, the government has auctioned 55 mining blocks, with 34 blocks already allocated to private and public sector entities. This regulatory reform aims to accelerate private sector participation while maintaining strategic oversight of critical mineral development.

In addition, the permitting reform initiative targets reduction of approval timelines from the historical 18-24 month average to 12 months through integrated clearance mechanisms. Success in this administrative streamlining could significantly improve project economics and capital deployment decisions.

International Acquisition and Partnership Framework

India's international mineral diplomacy has yielded several concrete agreements designed to diversify supply sources and reduce single-supplier dependencies.

The Mongolia Strategic Partnership Agreement provides access to the Khalzan Buregtei fluorspar deposits and Khotgor copper/molybdenum/rare earth deposits. The Khotgor site contains estimated rare earth reserves of 16-18 million tonnes of ore with 0.1-0.15% total rare earth oxide concentration. India's commitment through Coal India Limited and the Ministry of Mines involves an estimated USD $500-700 million investment over 5-7 years for exploration and mine development.

Chilean lithium exploration initiatives, led by Coal India Limited, focus on securing equity stakes or long-term offtake agreements in Chile's Atacama and Antofagasta regions. The strategy targets 5-10% equity stakes in producing lithium operations or negotiated offtake agreements for lithium carbonate and hydroxide.

However, the proposed Russia-India mineral corridor via Trans-Siberian Railway connectivity could reduce freight costs by 25-35% compared to maritime routes through the Suez Canal. Implementation remains uncertain due to geopolitical complexities and international sanctions considerations.

Stockpiling and Supply Chain Resilience

Strategic stockpiling represents the near-term component of India's mineral security framework. The government has allocated USD $57.5 million for establishing and maintaining strategic mineral reserves under the National Critical Minerals Mission.

The target involves maintaining two-month supply buffers for critical materials, approximately equivalent to:

50,000-75,000 tonnes lithium carbonate equivalent

15,000-20,000 tonnes cobalt metal equivalent

25,000-35,000 tonnes rare earth oxides

40,000-60,000 tonnes battery-grade graphite

Public-private partnership models for stockpile management aim to distribute storage costs whilst ensuring government access during supply disruptions. These arrangements may involve private sector storage facilities with government purchase options or shared storage arrangements with manufacturing end-users.

Which International Models Could India Adapt for Success?

Examining successful critical mineral strategies from other nations reveals both opportunities and limitations for India's approach. Different countries have developed distinct models based on their resource endowments, industrial base, and geopolitical positioning.

China's Integrated Value Chain Approach

China's dominance in critical mineral processing stems from decades-long investment in midstream processing capabilities rather than merely controlling raw material extraction. The Chinese model emphasises vertical integration from mining through manufacturing, with state support for developing solvent extraction, separation, and metallisation capabilities.

Key lessons for India include the importance of processing capacity development. China controls approximately 70% of global rare earth refining capacity despite holding only 37% of global reserves. This processing monopoly generates higher value-added returns and creates supply chain dependencies that extend far beyond raw material access.

For India, this suggests prioritising investment in separation and refining infrastructure alongside mining development. However, replicating China's approach requires accepting initial losses during capacity building phases, sustained government support, and integrated demand from downstream manufacturing sectors.

Australia's Resource Diplomacy Strategy

Australia has leveraged its substantial critical mineral reserves through strategic partnerships with allied nations, particularly the United States, Japan, and European Union countries. This approach emphasises technology sharing agreements, joint ventures, and export facilitation frameworks.

Australia's Critical Minerals Strategy focuses on building processing capabilities through international partnerships rather than attempting complete domestic value chain development. The Greenbushes lithium operation, for example, ships spodumene concentrate to Chinese refineries while developing alternative processing partnerships with Japanese and South Korean companies.

India could adapt this model by developing processing partnerships with friendly nations, particularly those seeking to diversify away from Chinese supply chains. This approach reduces capital requirements whilst building technical capabilities and market access.

European Union's Circular Economy Integration

The European Union's Critical Raw Materials Act emphasises recycling, substitution research, and sustainable extraction practices alongside supply diversification. The EU targets 15% of critical mineral demand to be met through recycling by 2030, with substantial investment in urban mining and material recovery technologies.

For India, circular economy approaches offer particular relevance given the country's growing electronic waste streams. Furthermore, the potential for a battery recycling breakthrough could supplement primary production whilst reducing environmental impacts through permanent magnet recovery and rare earth extraction from electronic waste.

Substitution research represents another EU focus area with potential Indian applications. Developing alternative materials for specific applications or improving material efficiency in manufacturing processes can reduce critical mineral intensity without compromising performance.

What Are the Primary Implementation Challenges?

Despite comprehensive planning and significant resource allocation, India's critical minerals strategy faces substantial implementation hurdles that could determine ultimate success or failure.

Administrative and Regulatory Bottlenecks

Inter-ministerial coordination gaps represent the most immediate implementation challenge. Critical mineral projects require approvals from mining, environment, industry, forest, tribal affairs, and defence ministries, each operating with distinct priorities and timelines.

The parliamentary committee report emphasises that administrative bottlenecks, rather than geological constraints, represent the binding constraint on progress. Current permitting processes lack integrated assessment mechanisms, leading to sequential rather than parallel approval workflows.

Environmental compliance presents particular complexity for rare earth extraction. Monazite processing generates radioactive tailings requiring long-term storage and monitoring. India currently lacks established protocols for radioactive waste management comparable to those in Australia or the United States, creating regulatory uncertainty for project development.

Community consultation processes add another layer of complexity. Many critical mineral deposits are located in tribal areas or ecologically sensitive zones where local communities have legitimate concerns about environmental impacts and benefit-sharing arrangements.

Capital Investment and Technology Gaps

Private sector risk assessment for long-term mining projects requires regulatory predictability and market clarity that India has yet to establish. Critical mineral projects typically require 10-15 year development timelines from exploration through commercial production, demanding sustained policy support across multiple electoral cycles.

Technology transfer requirements for advanced processing present additional challenges. Rare earth separation technologies, lithium extraction from hard-rock deposits, and battery-grade graphite purification involve proprietary processes controlled by established global players.

Consequently, exploring lithium industry innovations becomes crucial for understanding technological advancement opportunities. Skills development for specialised mining and metallurgy operations requires substantial investment in technical education and training programmes.

Market Competition and Pricing Dynamics

Cost competitiveness against established global suppliers represents a fundamental economic challenge. Australian and Chilean operations benefit from decades of infrastructure development, optimised processes, and established customer relationships.

Quality standards and certification requirements add complexity to market entry. Battery manufacturers, magnet producers, and other end-users maintain strict quality specifications that new suppliers must demonstrate through extensive testing and qualification processes.

Long-term offtake agreement structuring requires balancing price stability with market competitiveness. Fixed-price contracts provide revenue certainty for project financing but may become uneconomical if market prices fall below contract levels.

How Should Investors Evaluate India's Critical Minerals Opportunity?

Investment assessment in India's critical minerals sector requires careful analysis of multiple risk and opportunity factors that distinguish this emerging market from established mining jurisdictions.

Risk Assessment Framework

Regulatory stability and policy predictability represent the primary investment consideration. Whilst the National Critical Minerals Mission provides policy framework, implementation depends on sustained political commitment across multiple government levels and electoral cycles.

Geological risk assessment must balance India's substantial mineral endowment against limited exploration data. Many deposits remain conceptual rather than proven through systematic drilling and metallurgical testing. Investors should distinguish between geological potential and bankable reserves when evaluating specific projects.

Infrastructure development requirements create additional risk considerations. Many critical mineral deposits are located in remote areas requiring substantial investment in roads, power supply, water access, and processing facilities. These infrastructure costs may not be reflected in early-stage project economics.

Environmental and social licensing represents an evolving risk factor. India's environmental regulations are becoming more stringent, whilst community expectations for benefit-sharing and environmental protection continue to increase.

Market Entry Strategies for International Players

Joint venture opportunities with Indian public sector undertakings offer potential risk mitigation and regulatory facilitation. Organisations like Coal India Limited, National Mineral Development Corporation, and Mineral Exploration Corporation Limited possess government relationships and domestic market knowledge that international players lack.

Technology partnership and licensing arrangements may provide lower-risk entry points than direct mining investment. Indian companies need access to advanced processing technologies, whilst international technology holders seek market access and production partnerships.

Supply chain integration possibilities exist for companies with downstream manufacturing operations in India. For instance, establishing a battery-grade lithium refinery to serve domestic demand whilst building export capabilities could optimise scale economies and market positioning.

Timeline Expectations and Milestone Tracking

Short-term achievements (2025-2027) should focus on stockpiling implementation and import source diversification. Success metrics include establishing strategic reserves, finalising international partnership agreements, and demonstrating permitting process improvements.

Medium-term development (2027-2030) involves scaling domestic production from pilot operations to commercially significant output. Key milestones include first production from auctioned mining blocks, completion of processing infrastructure, and achievement of quality certifications for domestic minerals.

Long-term objectives (2030+) target processing capability development and potential export market development. Success indicators include achieving target import dependency reduction levels, establishing India as a regional processing hub, and developing technology export capabilities.

What Does Success Look Like for India's Critical Minerals Strategy?

Defining success requires both quantitative metrics and qualitative strategic outcomes that extend beyond simple import substitution targets.

Quantitative Success Metrics

Import dependency reduction targets vary by mineral category based on domestic resource potential and processing complexity:

Lithium: Reduction from 100% import dependency to 60-70% by 2030, 40-50% by 2035

Rare Earth Elements: Reduction from 80% import dependency to 50-60% by 2030, 30-40% by 2035

Graphite: Reduction from high import dependency to 30-40% by 2030 through domestic processing

Cobalt: Maintain diversified import sources whilst developing recycling capabilities to meet 20-30% of demand by 2035

Domestic production capacity milestones include:

25,000-35,000 tonnes annual lithium carbonate equivalent production by 2030

15,000-20,000 tonnes annual rare earth oxide production by 2030

50,000-75,000 tonnes annual battery-grade graphite production by 2030

Strategic stockpile adequacy should maintain 60-90 day supply buffers for all critical materials, with option to expand during geopolitical tensions or supply disruptions.

Qualitative Strategic Outcomes

Enhanced energy security extends beyond simple supply availability to include price stability, quality assurance, and supply chain resilience during global disruptions. Success involves maintaining reliable access to critical materials regardless of international political tensions or trade disputes.

Strengthened geopolitical positioning in critical mineral markets could establish India as an alternative supplier for countries seeking to diversify away from Chinese supply chains. This positioning requires developing reputation for reliability, quality, and responsible mining practices.

Industrial competitiveness in clean energy technologies depends on secure, cost-effective access to critical materials for domestic manufacturing. Success metrics include growth in domestic battery manufacturing, permanent magnet production, and solar panel assembly using domestically-sourced materials.

Regional and Global Impact Scenarios

India's emergence as a significant critical minerals producer could contribute to global supply chain diversification and reduce concentration risks currently present in the market. This outcome benefits global energy transition goals whilst strengthening India's strategic positioning.

South-South cooperation opportunities may emerge through technology sharing, joint venture development, and expertise exchange with other developing nations possessing critical mineral resources. India's technical capabilities and market access could facilitate resource development in African and Latin American countries.

Technology and expertise export potential represents a long-term strategic outcome where India becomes a supplier of mining technology, processing equipment, and technical services to other emerging mineral producers. This transformation from resource importer to technology exporter would demonstrate comprehensive sector development success.

Frequently Asked Questions About India's Critical Minerals Strategy

Understanding the practical implementation and realistic timelines for India's critical minerals strategy requires addressing common questions and misconceptions about the initiative.

How quickly can India reduce its import dependency?

Realistic timeline analysis reveals that meaningful import dependency reduction requires 5-10 years minimum for most critical materials. Lithium extraction from Northeast deposits faces the longest development timeline due to infrastructure requirements and processing complexity.

Rare earth elements offer the most promising near-term opportunities, given existing reserves in Chhattisgarh and Odisha. However, developing thorium-safe processing capabilities may require 3-5 years of technology development and regulatory framework establishment.

Graphite presents intermediate complexity, with potential for significant domestic production within 5-7 years given existing deposits and relatively straightforward processing requirements. Battery-grade specifications may require additional purification infrastructure development.

International comparison suggests tempering expectations: Australia required 15-20 years to become a dominant lithium producer despite favourable geology and established mining infrastructure. Chile's lithium industry development spanned multiple decades before achieving current scale.

What role will recycling play in India's strategy?

Urban mining potential from electronic waste could supply 15-25% of India's rare earth requirements by 2030, given the country's growing electronic waste streams and expanding consumer electronics market.

Battery recycling capabilities could address 20-30% of lithium and cobalt demand by 2035 as first-generation electric vehicle batteries reach end-of-life. However, this requires developing collection networks, processing facilities, and quality standards for recycled materials.

Permanent magnet recovery from electronic waste, wind turbines, and industrial equipment represents another recycling opportunity. India processes substantial volumes of electronic waste, providing feedstock for rare earth element recovery operations.

Technology requirements for efficient material recovery include hydrometallurgical processing, solvent extraction capabilities, and purification systems. These technologies overlap with primary mining processing requirements, creating potential synergies in infrastructure development.

How will environmental concerns be balanced with extraction needs?

Sustainable mining practice implementation requires adopting international best practices for water management, tailings storage, and ecosystem restoration. India's regulatory framework is evolving to incorporate these standards into project approval processes.

Community benefit-sharing mechanisms must balance local development needs with extraction economics. Successful models from other jurisdictions include revenue sharing, local employment requirements, and infrastructure development commitments.

Environmental monitoring and restoration protocols represent ongoing operational requirements rather than one-time project costs. Long-term success depends on demonstrating responsible extraction practices that maintain social licence to operate.

India's critical minerals strategy represents one of the most comprehensive attempts by a major economy to achieve strategic autonomy in critical material supply chains. Success will require sustained commitment across multiple electoral cycles, substantial capital investment, and careful balance of domestic development with international partnerships.

The ultimate measure of success lies not in achieving complete self-sufficiency, but in building resilient supply chains that can withstand global disruptions whilst supporting India's clean energy transition and manufacturing competitiveness goals. This outcome requires coordination across government, private sector, and international partners working toward shared objectives of energy security and sustainable development.

And people around the country took the cue. Corporations got quiet about their climate plans. Democratic politicians steered clear of phrases like “planetary emergency.” Media coverage of the climate crisis thinned. That all trickled down to everyday Americans, who say they’re hearing less than they used to about climate change on social media and from the people they know.

While greenlash might sound like a very American phenomenon, it actually took off in Europe. The EU was an early adopter of comprehensive climate policies, and also saw the first big wave of greenlash. That opposition was mainly driven by specific economic burdens — Germany’s plan to switch to energy-efficient heat pumps caused an uproar as homeowners worried about the costs, for example. In the United States, the greenlash gathered more fuel from Trump-style populism and the culture wars.

With a tumultuous 2025 coming to an end, dictionary editors have been digging through the lexicon for words that capture its spirit. Their picks — “AI slop,” “rage bait” and the essentially meaningless phrase “6-7” — point to a world that’s very online, and not doing much better for it. For us at Grist, greenlash stood out as the word of the year, marking a moment when climate change was yanked off the political priority list.

The mood might have shifted, but people in the U.S. are about as concerned about climate change as they’ve ever been, with about two-thirds saying they’re worried. The consequences of a warming planet were on full display this year, from the horrific fires that burned through Los Angeles neighborhoods in January to the rains that drenched Texas in July, causing the deadliest flash flooding in the country in half a century. It was also a turbulent time for the politics of climate change, a trend reflected in these words and phrases that captured the zeitgeist.

Carbon pawprint

A cheeky way to capture your pet’s contribution to climate change, based on the concept of a carbon footprint.

A host of articles this year highlighted how cats and dogs have an outsized carbon pawprint — and, wow, pet owners got worked up about it. The chief culprit is the meat-heavy diets they feed their pets, with beef in particular emitting a lot of methane, a powerful, planet-warming gas. The conversation really kicked into gear this summer with a headline from The Associated Press: “People often miscalculate climate choices, a study says. One surprise is owning a dog.”

The dog ownership question was only a tiny part of that study, which investigated how people rank the climate impact of various personal actions, like going vegan or using public transit. But the headline’s focus blew up on Reddit, where people complained that focusing on individual responsibility instead of big, systemic changes missed the point. “Climate change is actually your fault because you have a dog,” one user wrote sarcastically.

Cheap energy

A Democratic messaging slogan linking clean energy with lower costs for consumers.

Hoping to reach Americans more concerned about rising electricity bills than the upward march of global temperatures, Democrats have been talking more and more about how clean energy is cheap energy. After getting trounced in the 2024 election, many Democratic politicians turned to polling to see what had gone wrong. One theory was that they spent too much time talking about social issues like climate change and LGBTQ+ rights, putting them out of step with voters who cared more about affordability and health care. As one new think tank, the Searchlight Institute, summed it up: “Don’t say climate change.”

Climate champions in Congress aren’t avoiding the topic entirely, but selling climate-friendly policies as a strategy to lower the cost of living instead. In September, for instance, two Democratic representatives, Sean Casten and Mike Levin, introduced the “Cheap Energy Agenda.” There’s some evidence the pivot might be working, after Democrats notched wins in November’s off-year election in races where energy costs played an important role.

Critical minerals

Raw materials that are crucial for modern technology, but in limited supply.

It was hard to avoid the phrase critical minerals in 2025, when it moved from policy jargon to the headlines. These metals — including lithium, cobalt, nickel and so-called “rare earths” — are essential for building solar panels and the batteries that power electric vehicles and e-bikes.

The Trump administration has been aggressively chasing these metals as part of its national security strategy, hoping to secure the vital ingredients for making everything from smartphones to high-tech military technologies. Trump signed executive orders calling for more mining of critical minerals and fast-tracked permits for new projects, while also setting his sights on procuring more supply abroad by negotiating deals in Ukraine, central Africa and across Asia.

Stocks for some rare-earth mining companies have more than tripled this year as critical minerals got hyped up. Some experts think that the future of geopolitics will be more defined by these critical metals than by oil.

Energy dominance

A slogan-turned-policy-goal emphasizing fossil fuel production and American power.

When Trump signed an executive order on Inauguration Day aimed at “unleashing energy dominance,” the phrase left experts scratching their heads. It soon became clear it had everything to do with maximizing the production of oil, gas and coal in order to gain leverage over other countries.

It certainly had nothing to do with dominating the market for renewable energy. Experts told Grist that the phrase seems to be more about vibes than specific policy goals. It taps into a nostalgia for what fossil fuels once promised — optimism, growth and a certain ideal of masculine work. This kind of chest-beating reaction to industrial decline and climate change even has a name: “petro-masculinity.”

Green New Scam

A Trumpism that counters climate policy by rebranding the “Green New Deal” as a conspiracy.

The Green New Scam has become the Trump administration’s defining line on efforts to take on climate change. Trump came up with the catchphrase during a rally in New Hampshire in 2023, while riffing on ways to attack Biden’s climate policies. When he landed on “Green New Scam,” the crowd roared with approval, and he sensed he was onto something — even though Congress had never actually passed a Green New Deal.

Renee Hobbs, who wrote a book on modern propaganda, told Grist that Trump’s repetition of Green New Scam fits into a classic strategy: “You repeat the phrases that you want to stick, and you downplay, ignore, minimize or censor the concepts that don’t meet your agenda.”

Rain anxiety

A growing sense of dread triggered by rainfall.

For many people, the sound of raindrops isn’t comforting at all, but terrifying. If you’ve survived a flood, it can bring up traumatic memories, leading to what’s called rain anxiety. “Anyone else getting mildly stressed when it rains a lot?” reads a typical Reddit post on the matter. Floods struck many parts of the U.S. this year — not only Texas, but also New Mexico, Illinois, North Carolina, New York and Washington state.

By mid-year, the National Weather Service had issued almost 4,000 flash-floods alerts, the most for that time period since 1986. About 20% to 30% of people who live through flooding develop depression or post-traumatic stress disorder in the months afterward, according to a report from the U.N.’s international panel of climate scientists. There’s a clear connection to climate change: A warmer atmosphere can hold more moisture, making the idiom “when it rains, it pours” more of a reality than ever before.

Swasticar

A new, derogatory name for Tesla vehicles, blending “swastika” with “car.”

Tesla used to be the undisputed leader of the electric vehicle market, but that changed in 2025. After Elon Musk, the company’s CEO, gave two stiff-armed gestures at Trump’s inauguration in January, one question consumed the internet: Was that a Nazi salute? Activists soon started pressuring people to stop buying Teslas and sell their swasticars — a term that captured the company’s sudden transformation from a green status symbol into something associated with far-right extremism.

It didn’t help the company’s reputation when Musk started axing jobs and funding across federal agencies as co-lead of Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency, aka DOGE. Tesla sales tumbled over the course of the year — in the United States and abroad — even as the company started rolling out cheaper models. Tesla also faced growing competition from the Chinese EV company BYD and the loss of U.S. electric vehicle tax credits at the end of September after Congress rolled them back.

Dec 30 (Reuters) – Tesla deliveries were expected to fall in the fourth quarter, as the loss of U.S. tax credits and rising global competition sapped demand even as the company rolled out cheaper versions of its best-selling ‍electric vehicles.

The decline would follow plummeting sales in the first two quarters of the year when CEO Elon Musk faced a backlash for his political rhetoric. Third-quarter sales got a boost as buyers rushed to lock in tax credits before they expired in September. Still, Tesla is likely to report its second straight drop in annual deliveries, with this year’s decline steeper.

In October, Tesla launched stripped-down versions of the Model Y SUV ‌and Model 3 compact sedan called Standard. It will face competition ‌from affordable EVs made by Chevrolet and Ford, which are expected to hit the market over the next two years.

Analysts expect Tesla’s sales to recover next year, as the Standard versions, priced about $5,000 below previous base models, help the company defend volumes in Europe and Asia, where Chinese EVs are gaining ground.

The ​company is expected to report fourth-quarter and annual production and delivery numbers on Friday.

NORTH AMERICA, EUROPE SALES HURT

Investor enthusiasm in Tesla largely rests on Musk’s pivot to expanding robotaxis, producing humanoid ‍robots, and improving self-driving technology in its cars. Still, EV ​sales generate much of its current revenue.

Tesla is expected to deliver 432,810 ​vehicles in the December quarter, down about 13% from a year earlier, according to analysts polled by ‍Visible Alpha (VA). Another consensus of 20 analysts compiled by Tesla and released on Monday shows that a sharper drop of 15% to 422,850 vehicles is expected.

Tesla’s full-year deliveries were expected to be 1.65 million vehicles this year, down 7.8% from a year earlier, marking the second consecutive annual decline, according to Visible Alpha’s poll.

The fall will be driven largely by sales in North ‍America and Europe, Deutsche Bank analyst Edison Yu said in a note.

MUSK MAY BE MORE FOCUSED IN 2026

The slowdown in sales has not dampened a rise in the company’s share price. Tesla shares rose ‍over 14% this year, boosting ‍Musk’s wealth. Facing criticism for running a cost-cutting arm of President Donald ​Trump’s administration, Musk has indicated he will focus on his businesses.

A ​recent court ⁠ruling cleared the way for Musk to reclaim a Tesla pay ‌package that had been voided by a Delaware court. Shareholders in November also approved a new compensation package that could be worth roughly $878 billion over the next 10 years for the world’s richest person.

Delivering 20 million vehicles in total is a key goal for that pay along with other milestones on robotaxi expansion, robot sales and valuation.

The move helps the South Korean company grow its business by expanding its chip business beyond memory into logic design and foundry-related services.

As per a report by Pulse, the English service of Maeil Business News Korea, the new BMW iX3 is a medium-sized electric SUV. It is the first car made in large numbers to use BMW's new electric system called Neue Klasse. This vehicle was first shown to the public in Germany and will start selling in South Korea during the second half of next year.

Samsung created a specific chip for this car called the Exynos Auto V720. These types of chips manage the entertainment and information systems inside a car. They help the car show driving details, play high-quality videos, and run video games on the car's screens. Samsung previously gave similar chips to other car companies like Audi and Volkswagen.

After the iX3, Samsung wants to put its chips in many more BMW cars. Future models like the 7 Series may use an even more powerful chip called the Exynos Auto V920. This flagship chip uses 10 small processing units to work faster while using less power. When BMW unveiled the iX3, the company said the car has four high-performance computers that are 20 times faster than older versions.

'Industry reviews have also highlighted the vehicle's in-vehicle infotainment capabilities, particularly its audio and video processing performance. Analysts say the Exynos Auto-based computing architecture plays a key role in delivering stable performance for autonomous driving features and infotainment systems,' the report said.

Samsung Chairman Jay Y. Lee worked closely with partners as a contributing factor. He recently visited other big electric car makers like BYD and Xiaomi and met with the leader of Mercedes-Benz. Samsung sees future cars as a very important part of its business.

Different parts of the company work together to make batteries, screens, and audio systems for cars. Recently, Samsung's company Harman even bought a German business that helps cars drive more safely.

'This BMW supply deal is significant in that Samsung has expanded its portfolio with a German automaker, a segment with very high barriers to entry,' the report quoted an industry official. (ANI)

They help the car show driving details, play high-quality videos, and run video games on the car's screens. Samsung previously gave similar chips to other car companies like Audi and Volkswagen.

After the iX3, Samsung wants to put its chips in many more BMW cars. Future models like the 7 Series may use an even more powerful chip called the Exynos Auto V920. This flagship chip uses 10 small processing units to work faster while using less power. When BMW unveiled the iX3, the company said the car has four high-performance computers that are 20 times faster than older versions.

'Industry reviews have also highlighted the vehicle's in-vehicle infotainment capabilities, particularly its audio and video processing performance. Analysts say the Exynos Auto-based computing architecture plays a key role in delivering stable performance for autonomous driving features and infotainment systems,' the report said.

Samsung Chairman Jay Y. Lee worked closely with partners as a contributing factor. He recently visited other big electric car makers like BYD and Xiaomi and met with the leader of Mercedes-Benz. Samsung sees future cars as a very important part of its business.

Different parts of the company work together to make batteries, screens, and audio systems for cars. Recently, Samsung's company Harman even bought a German business that helps cars drive more safely.

'This BMW supply deal is significant in that Samsung has expanded its portfolio with a German automaker, a segment with very high barriers to entry,' the report quoted an industry official.

For investors, that’s a risk/reward calculation. For someone about to spend $79,900 on a Gravity Touring, it’s something more nuanced than Wall Street headlines suggest.

Here’s what you need to know:

What: Lucid’s total liquidity stands at $5.5 billion, projected to last until first half of 2027

The math: The company burns nearly $1 billion per quarter and has never turned a profit

The backstop: Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund owns 55-60% of the company and keeps expanding credit facilities

Why it matters: Your Lucid warranty is 4 years/50,000 miles. The confirmed runway is 18 months. But “confirmed” isn’t the whole story.

The Motley Fool analysis frames this as an investment question, but the real story for buyers is more complicated than either the doom scenarios or the bull cases suggest.

The Financial Reality: Worse Than It Looks, Better Than You’d Think

Lucid’s headline numbers are genuinely alarming. The company posted a net loss of $978.4 million in Q3 2025 alone. The accumulated deficit has ballooned to nearly $13 billion. GAAP gross margin was approximately negative 99% last quarter, meaning Lucid loses money on virtually every vehicle it sells.

The Motley Fool piece puts it bluntly: “This money-losing business is basically telling investors that it has a year to a year-and-a-half of money left.”

But here’s what that analysis underplays: Lucid isn’t backed by venture capitalists who might cut their losses. Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund views Lucid as a strategic pillar of Vision 2030, the kingdom’s plan to diversify beyond oil. The PIF has repeatedly expanded credit facilities even as the stock hit all-time lows. They recently increased an undrawn credit line from $750 million to nearly $2 billion.

Sovereign wealth funds don’t behave like VCs. They think in decades, not quarters. The PIF has the resources to extend Lucid’s runway indefinitely if they choose to. The question isn’t whether Saudi Arabia can keep Lucid alive. It’s whether they will, and under what terms.

The Quality Problem That Complicates The Picture

If Lucid’s vehicles were bulletproof, the financial situation would be easier to dismiss. But that’s not the reality we’ve documented this year.

Earlier this month, we covered Jason Fenske’s ownership experience. The Engineering Explained host, a mechanical engineer with 4 million YouTube subscribers, documented 25+ failures in just 3,000 miles with his 2025 Lucid Air Touring. His verdict: “This car by an enormous margin is the most frustrating vehicle I have ever owned.”

What made Fenske’s critique so damaging was that it came from a true believer. He bought the car specifically because he considers the Air “one of the best engineered vehicles the world has ever seen.” The engineering is brilliant. The execution is beta-level software and inconsistent hardware quality control.

Add to this our coverage of Lucid’s lease-end billing controversy, where customers reported excessive wear-and-tear charges reaching thousands of dollars for minor cosmetic damage. One customer received a $7,600 bill including a nearly $4,900 taillight replacement. The backlash forced Lucid to overhaul its lease-end policies.

These quality and service issues matter because they determine how much you’ll actually need Lucid’s support infrastructure. A company with financial constraints and quality problems is a different risk profile than one with just financial constraints.

The Post-Subsidy Perfect Storm

The Motley Fool analysis explicitly connects Lucid’s struggles to something we’ve been covering all year: “EV sales have been weak since government subsidies were halted.”

The September 30 expiration of the $7,500 federal EV tax credit under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act fundamentally changed the economics of luxury EV purchases. October EV sales collapsed 24% in a single month. Lucid’s Gravity Touring launched at $79,900 just weeks after that credit disappeared.

For context, that same $79,900 Gravity would have effectively cost $72,400 with the tax credit intact. The credit expiration added roughly $100 per month to a typical 72-month loan payment. That’s meaningful for a vehicle already positioned at the premium end of the market.

Lucid has slashed its 2025 production forecast to approximately 18,000 vehicles, down from the 20,000 it targeted at the start of the year. That’s boutique-level volume, but Lucid’s cost structure isn’t built for boutique economics. Ferrari makes roughly 13,000 cars annually and prints money. The difference is Ferrari doesn’t lose $978 million per quarter. Lucid’s problem isn’t the volume. It’s the margin.

The Acquisition Safety Valve

Here’s something the doom scenarios miss: even if Lucid fails as a standalone company, owners probably aren’t abandoned.

Lucid’s powertrain technology is widely considered the most efficient in the industry. The Air’s 500+ mile range from a sedan-sized battery pack isn’t marketing fluff. It’s genuine engineering achievement that legacy automakers haven’t matched. That technology has value regardless of whether Lucid survives as a car company.

The Nvidia partnership for Level 4 autonomy and the Uber deal for 20,000 Gravity SUVs signal that Lucid is already positioning itself as more than just a vehicle manufacturer. If the car business struggles, Lucid’s intellectual property makes them a prime acquisition target for a Ford, Volkswagen, or tech giant looking to leapfrog their EV capabilities.

In an acquisition scenario, the acquirer typically assumes warranty and service obligations to protect brand reputation. It’s not guaranteed, but it’s more likely than the “orphaned vehicle” nightmare.

What Happens In Each Scenario

Scenario 1: PIF keeps extending the runway

Most likely outcome. Saudi Arabia has too much invested to walk away. Owners see no disruption, though the company may look very different in 5 years. The midsize vehicle launching late 2026 is the real test of whether Lucid can achieve sustainable economics.

Scenario 2: Strategic acquisition

A legacy automaker or tech company buys Lucid for the technology. Warranty and service obligations transfer to an acquirer with deeper pockets and established infrastructure. Owners might actually benefit from access to a larger service network.

Scenario 3: Pivot to technology licensing

Lucid scales back direct vehicle production and focuses on licensing powertrain technology to other manufacturers. Existing owners see continued support but slower software development and eventually frozen features.

Scenario 4: Liquidation (least likely)

The PIF walks away, no buyer emerges, Lucid winds down operations. Warranty coverage becomes meaningless, parts sourcing becomes a nightmare, software updates stop. Your $80,000 vehicle loses 30-50% of its value overnight.

The first two scenarios are far more probable than the last two. But “probably fine” is different from “definitely fine,” and the stakes are high enough to warrant clear-eyed assessment.

EVXL’s Take

Here’s what I expect: Lucid survives, but not necessarily as a pure-play automaker. The Saudi PIF has too much invested to let the company collapse entirely, and Lucid’s technology is too valuable to disappear even if the car business stumbles.

The real question for buyers isn’t “will Lucid exist in 5 years?” It probably will. The question is “will Lucid look like the company I’m buying from today?”

The irony remains painful: Lucid builds genuinely exceptional vehicles. U.S. News just named them the Best Luxury Electric Vehicle Brand, beating Tesla, Porsche, BMW, and Rivian. The Gravity’s space-to-footprint ratio is engineering brilliance. The Air’s efficiency is unmatched.

But engineering excellence doesn’t guarantee business success when you’re losing money on every car, the tax credits that made luxury EVs affordable just evaporated, and your software still feels beta-quality to owners like Jason Fenske.

If you’re cross-shopping a Rivian R1S, BMW iX, or Mercedes EQS SUV, the financial stability of those companies is a legitimate factor in your decision. But so is the unique Saudi backing that makes Lucid different from every other EV startup. This isn’t Fisker or Lordstown. The safety net is real.

Should you buy a Lucid? The technology says yes. The financials say proceed with awareness. The Saudi backing says the doom scenarios are probably overblown. If you’re comfortable with uncertainty about what Lucid becomes in 3-5 years, it offers a driving experience that justifies the price. If you need certainty that your manufacturer will look exactly the same when your loan is paid off, the alternatives are lower-risk choices.

Are you considering a Lucid despite the uncertainty? Or have these factors pushed you toward competitors? Share your thinking in the comments.",https://evxl.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/img_3866-1-1.jpg,N,,2025-12-31 07:58:20.648679

It is a disjointed moment for energy policy in the United States. Democrats and Republicans are at sea. Neither party has a particularly coherent plan for how it expects to develop energy policy over the next decade or so. And both parties have too many visions, too many goals, and too many places where their aspirational coalitions conflict with their policy commitments to advance a clear theory of energy policy in 2025.

You can best understand this confusion by starting on the Republican side, I think — and by comparing energy policies from the first and second Trump administrations. Both administrations seem to share a common framework: Both set a goal of “energy dominance,” both have tried to enact favorable policies for the oil and gas industry, and both have been characterized by an aggressive approach to environmental and climate deregulation — and by a sense that greenhouse gas pollution is not only a necessary evil but a positive good. But there the similarities stop.

The first Trump administration continued a long-running policy of benign neglect, and even of occasional encouragement, to wind and solar energy development — provided such energy development did not undermine fossil fuels. It was Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke who, in December 2018, auctioned off sites for offshore wind development in Massachusetts — and when these sites were snapped up for a record $405 million, promptly celebrated a “BIDDING BONANZA.”

“To anyone who doubted that our ambitious vision for energy dominance would not include renewables, today we put that rumor to rest,” Zinke said at the time. “With bold leadership, faster, streamlined environmental reviews, and a lot of hard work with our states and fishermen, we’ve given the wind industry the confidence to think and bid big.”

The first Trump administration was by no means a climate champion. It tried to rescue the coal industry, in part through advancing an emergency rule at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission that would have subsidized coal-fired and nuclear power plants through power markets. Its Environmental Protection Agency ended the Obama administration’s attempt to regulate greenhouse gas pollution from power plants, and it weakened restrictions on tailpipe pollution from cars and light-duty trucks. And of course, it attacked California’s ability to regulate vehicle emissions.

But it rarely seemed to want to destroy the renewables industry, and it distinguished between climate policy and renewables policy. Perhaps it remained favorable to wind energy in part because Republican senators from the interior are favorable to wind energy. On the whole, it acted in a manner that was often defensibly pro-electricity development of all types.

The second Trump administration, by contrast, has sought to hamper and obstruct renewables development out of principle. Gone are the days when Zinke told the wind industry to “think and bid big.” Instead, the second Trump administration has told the wind industry to drop dead. It has implemented a de facto moratorium on new wind and solar projects on federal lands; it has sought new ways to revoke permits from offshore wind projects or block them outright.

At the same time, it has continued its crusade against climate policy. It has defanged the Transportation Department’s fuel efficiency standards. It has attacked state pollution policy once more, including California’s clean car standard, as well as New York City’s congestion pricing. And it has even sought to unwind the EPA’s endangerment finding, the determination that carbon dioxide is a dangerous pollutant and should be regulated as such.

This war on new energy sources has come just as the Trump administration has tried to tell voters that it cares about the rising cost of living — and, particularly, rising electricity costs. And it has come as the Trump administration has embraced AI, the industry driving more electricity demand growth than any other this century.

This combination has put the Trump administration in the position that George Pollack, a senior policy analyst at Signum Global Advisors, has called an “energy trilemma.” Trump wants to preside over an AI boom, avoid the political costs of rising energy prices, and block renewables growth. He can only pick two of these — and as more constraints hold back U.S. energy development, he might only be able to pick one.

Let me add to this another conflict that the Trump administration faces. Trump officials want the United States to catch up to China’s industrial development because they fear losing military competitiveness. But China’s economic model depends on encouraging and subsidizing market formation of what they call the “new three industries” — batteries, solar panels, and electric vehicles. Yet the administration does not want subsidized price parity for EVs, nor a competitive market for solar panels or electric vehicles; it would prefer that, perhaps with the exception of Tesla, as few people buy EVs as possible.

You can see this conflict most concretely in their critical minerals policy. From the first day of his second term, Trump has declared that America’s lack of mineral mining and refining capacity is an “energy emergency.” His administration has intervened in mineral markets — lining up financing and establishing a price floor for rare earth production, for example, or taking a stake in a lithium mine — in order to guarantee sufficient domestic supply. But the industries that actually use these minerals are largely wind turbine, electric vehicle, and electronics makers. Military equipment makes up a relatively small share of mineral use. He wants minerals, but he doesn’t want the industries that will actually use those minerals.

The clearest energy policy has come in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which, as the product of a legislative process, represents the Republican Party’s energy views rather than the president’s regulatory policies.

I think the law reveals that congressional Republicans have more coherent energy views than their copartisans in the administration — or at least that the pressures on congressional Republicans sometimes tilt the party in the direction of quasi-coherence. The most pulchritudinous act was, to be clear, terrible for clean energy innovation and deployment: It repealed the wind and solar tax credits and it junked consumer and business incentives for buying or leasing a new or used electric vehicle. It also repealed programs meant to encourage zero-carbon industrial development, particularly around the hydrogen industry. It was terrible for blue-collar workers in the Sun Belt, Gulf Coast, and Appalachia, who stood to benefit from EV manufacturing and clean industrial investment.

Yet it, again, revealed areas of intriguing quasi-coherence. One of the biggest policy innovations of the Inflation Reduction Act was to replace the government’s piecemeal investment and production tax credits for various energy technologies — such as wind, or solar, or geothermal — with a single zero-carbon technology-neutral investment and production tax credit. With this new policy, Democrats in Congress essentially said: We welcome the addition of any price-competitive generation resource on the grid as long as it emits essentially no carbon pollution. In theory, this liberated Democratic lawmakers from the endless process of adding and subtracting specific technologies from the tax code, and it showed that the party was listening to critics who said the government shouldn’t be picking particular technological winners and losers.

Now, Republican energy officials — particularly Secretary of Energy Chris Wright — have criticized the intermittent nature of renewables. They claim that wind and solar — which cannot flex their production of electricity to meet the grid’s needs, and which do not, of course, reliably produce electricity 24 hours of the day — impose unacknowledged costs to the power grid through the transmission grid. The facts, I should add, don’t agree; a recent Lawrence Berkeley National Lab study does not find that transmission costs are rising significantly in the U.S. — most of the recent electricity rate hikes have come from the rising cost of the local distribution system, particularly from transformers, poles, wires, and undergrounding equipment.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act’s changes to the zero-carbon technology-neutral tax credit cohere, at least, to Wright’s worldview. The GOP law leaves the technology-neutral tax credit intact, but excises wind and solar from it after 2027. This means that the law effectively preserves support for zero-carbon technologies that are flexible and do generate power 24/7 — such as, above all, batteries, but also advanced geothermal and nuclear fusion. And broadly, I would add that the Trump administration’s support for grid-scale batteries, which allow wind and solar electricity to spread out through the day; for advanced geothermal, which uses technology derived from fracking innovation to generate electricity; and for nuclear power of every stripe has been a rare spot where the administration has encouraged more low-carbon energy deployment.

Of course, any kindness there pales in comparison to how the administration has acted toward the oil and gas industry. Trump has lavished that industry with gifts: He opened vast new swaths of federal wilderness to drilling, including 1.5 million acres of Alaska’s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, and he hopes to open another billion acres of U.S. coastal waters to drilling. He has rolled back rules restricting methane pollution from U.S. drilling operations, approved new liquified natural gas export terminals, and attacked any regulation meant to conserve or more efficiently deploy fossil fuels in the transportation sector. This friendliness has, so far, failed to help the oil and gas industry out of its ongoing doldrums; oil prices have remained stubbornly low through Trump’s second term, in part because of his tariffs and in part because of rising battery vehicle deployment.

So that’s Trump. What a mess.

Unlike Trump’s energy trilemma, Democrats are dealing with a much more classic energy dilemma. It is much closer to dilemmas faced by liberal policymakers around the world: On the one hand, Democrats want to reduce carbon emissions; on the other hand, they want to lower nominal energy costs for voters — or at least keep them flat. The party has dealt with this dilemma in different ways. During the Obama administration, the party took an “all of the above” approach to energy: It largely encouraged the buildout of the country’s natural gas system — working sometimes hand-in-glove with environmentalists to shut down coal plants and replace them with natural gas — while pursuing EPA rules that sought to improve energy efficiency and reduce emissions from vehicles and power plants.

The Biden administration dealt with the energy dilemma in a different way, when it dealt with it at all. It passed the Inflation Reduction Act, the country’s first comprehensive climate law. The IRA incentivized and tried to buy down the deployment costs of many types of zero-carbon energy technologies, and it sought to speed up learning curves so as to achieve durably lower costs for decarbonization technology. It largely did not, however, ease the permitting or process barriers to adding more energy to the grid.

At the same time, the Biden administration was more hostile to the fossil fuel energy industry than the Obama administration had been — during the campaign, Biden said that the industry would eventually have to shut down — while paying occasional but intense attention to its ability to impose politically salient costs on Americans. This could sometimes come across as confused: The Biden administration slow-walked oil and gas permitting on federal lands through the Department of the Interior, but he — in a burst of policy creativity — released oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve during the period of painfully high gasoline prices following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

Since January, Democrats haven’t really had to face this dilemma in the same way because they have been locked out of federal power. This has allowed the party to, for instance, largely side-step questions of how to balance the AI buildout with keeping electricity costs low.

But Democrats will soon begin to face pressures at the state level. That recent Lawrence Berkeley National Labs study finds that while renewables do not increase electricity prices, state-level policies that mandate renewable penetration, such as renewable portfolio standards, sometimes do. In New Jersey, the governor-elect Mikie Sherrill won in part by promising to freeze the state’s electricity rates for the next two years. That commitment may butt up against the state’s environmental goals. Electricity prices are highest in those states or regions where Democrats have the most power; the party faces a risk that this fact may hurt its ability to marshal an electricity affordability argument against the Trump administration.

The party, too, is suffering from something of a climate politics hangover. President Biden embraced climate as one of the four “existential” threats facing the country, and he moved climate to the center of his legislative agenda; the party broadly moved left on climate and environmental justice. They did so in part under the belief that it was the right thing to do — and in part under the belief that young voters and voters of color would reward them for the shift.

In return, Democrats saw their numbers crater with young people, voters of color, and environmental justice communities in the 2024 election — and even if that collapse was not about climate policy, per se, so much as the president’s unpopularity, it suggests that climate is not a special issue for these demographics. The climate voter, to the extent they exist, is likely already a Democrat.

That is where the parties find themselves. Before I continue, I want to highlight two more trends — outside of party politics — that will shape and constrain how energy policymakers go forward.

The first is the reinvigorated political and economic importance of the electricity system. As you may know, America’s era of flat electricity demand has ended, and load growth has returned to the system. We are even seeing load growth now in places that were, until recently, losing heavy industry, such as the Mid-Atlantic. And while the largest driver of load growth has been the data center boom, AI has not, so far, been responsible for most load growth. The return of manufacturing, the slow electrification of the vehicle fleet, and plain old economic and population growth is driving much of the rise in demand.

There is a bigger change here than just a return in demand growth, though. Electricity is becoming more structurally important to the U.S. economy’s frontier industries. After two decades that saw upheavals in America’s oil, gas, and chemical sectors, but that left electricity largely untouched but for shifts in the generation mix, we are seeing hints of a structural reformation of the power sector.

But there are perils here. Electricity rates have risen twice as fast as inflation over the past year. That is driven by a rise in distribution costs — the poles, wires, underground equipment, and transformers that get power the last mile from substations to homes and businesses. Transformers have been in short supply more or less since the pandemic. Natural disaster costs — from wildfires out West and extreme storms in the Southeast — have forced utilities to rebuild the entire distribution grid in some regions, raising costs and further shocking supplies. In an investor letter last year, Warren Buffett warned that costs are getting so high that the industry may no longer be viable as a private business. “Certain utilities might no longer attract the savings of American citizens and will be forced to adopt the public-power model,” he wrote.

I would be loath here not to mention a final trend: The American natural gas system is about to see a significant demand expansion, as well. Over the next four years, North America’s liquified natural gas export capacity is essentially going to double; some 27% of U.S. gas production could now theoretically be exported. Natural gas provides 43% of U.S. electricity generation needs and 38% of overall U.S. energy needs; if linking American gas markets to global gas markets brings domestic gas prices closer to their global equilibrium, we are in for a price shock. This outcome isn’t guaranteed — in the late 2010s, liquified natural gas capacity increased without a significant rise in domestic gas prices — but it is a risk.

So: Republicans face an energy trilemma. Democrats face an energy dilemma. And the electricity system is becoming increasingly important — and coming under increasing stress. What does this mean for policy?

In the near term, the big question driving most energy and climate policy across both parties is: How can we — in the broadest sense — get to yes? How can the United States build, permit, connect, and construct the energy infrastructure that the economy needs to grow or decarbonize? How can we overcome the local barriers to renewable construction — or the national obstacles to more nuclear construction?

For Republicans, this question reflects a traditional deregulatory view. But for Democrats, this question is the end result of a successful shift — which I would argue began with the Paris Agreement — to reformulate the problem of climate change as a problem of decarbonization, not emissions reduction; that is, a problem of addition, as well as subtraction; of building new energy sources, as well as energy efficiency or conservation.

And for both parties, it reflects the unignorable influence of China’s new energy economy. China, for reasons owing as much to its political economy and internal anxieties as any externally oriented environmentalism, has built a new kind of energy economy — one that can swallow hundreds of terawatt-hours of load growth every year, that can build 360 gigawatts of wind, solar, and batteries at the same time that it plans 100 gigawatts of new coal-fired power plants. It has constructed the unintuitive-to-American-ears feat of a coal, hydro, and solar-based grid with flat or declining emissions. Policymakers are aware that this abundant and at least facially cheap electricity helps the country’s AI and manufacturing industries.

This question and these anxieties point to a few policies in the near term: permitting reform and transmission construction.

Permitting reform is a catch-all term for policies that could cut down on the bureaucratic or local obstacles to building energy and infrastructure projects, clean and fossil alike. This is the third Congress in a row that has tried to do something about permitting, and while the last two did pass small pieces of legislation, a “grand bargain” on permitting has remained elusive. Questions about permitting reform tend to fall into three big buckets.

The first are what gates the permitting review process: What sets off the permitting review process? The National Environmental Policy Act applies to any “major federal action.” But what is a major federal action? When the government lends money, or grants it to a nonprofit, does that constitute a “major federal action”? Should it? Right now, the answer is usually yes — meaning that a federal loan to, say, a new EV factory essentially creates a federal nexus for that project and thus thousands of hours of paperwork requirements and litigation exposure. Should that change?

Are there some actions that never need a NEPA review? For the past two decades, Congress has said that the government didn’t need to review oil and gas drilling under NEPA if that drilling happened on a sub-five-acre footprint or on federal land which the government had already planned for oil or gas extraction. In just the first two years this exclusion was created, the BLM approved 6,100 permits under this rationale, according to the Government Accountability Office, so this policy is now likely responsible for tens of thousands of approved permits. Should other types of activity never face a NEPA review? For instance, advanced geothermal technology uses similar equipment to that used in fracking and it has a similar land footprint.

What often holds up a federal project is not the NEPA review itself, but the open-ended legislation that can follow such a review. We also know that one driver of very long NEPA reviews — reviews far in excess of what legislators envisioned when they wrote the law — is a fear that courts will reject it.

That brings us to the second question: When and how can the courts review a NEPA or permitting decision? Who can file a lawsuit? Are there remedies that don’t involve forcing an agency to redo an environmental review all over again? And finally, should courts take the position that a gap in the analysis does not presumptively invalidate an agency’s work?

Finally, how far does your analysis of a project’s environmental impact have to go to meet NEPA’s mandate? Does it have to extend just to the fenceline of a project, or to the county line? Or does it need to encompass the whole planet? Earlier this year, the Supreme Court ruled in the Seven County case that a NEPA review does not need to consider greenhouse gas emissions downstream of a project, such as those that would be released when a new railroad project opens up a new area for oil exploration. Should Congress extend that logic to the universe of NEPA reviews?

Those three questions dominate most permitting reform policy discussions around NEPA. But permitting reform, as I said earlier, is a catch-all — and each party has concerns that do not fall so elegantly in those categories. Progressives usually want permitting reform to include a commitment to expand agency staffing. They believe that NEPA reviews take so long to complete in many cases not because the law’s requirements are too onerous, but because the government lacks the labor hours to process the reviews that it has, in essence, assigned itself. Republicans, meanwhile, favor a fossil-friendly change: They want to see Congress alter the Clean Water Act so that state governments can no longer block new pipelines. This reform would not favor clean energy, but the oil and gas industry believes that it will only be politically feasible if it passed in a broader permitting reform package.

Lately, the parties have begun to agree on a new idea. The Trump administration’s successful efforts to block offshore wind, solar, and battery projects that have already been approved has raised concerns about executive interference. Democrats lament what Trump is doing, while Republicans fear a future Democrat could use those powers to block fossil fuel projects. The SPEED Act, which passed the House this month, includes a new provision meant to block presidents from interfering with already-approved energy projects. But the SPEED Act would not pass the Senate as written.

America struggles to build new long-distance transmission lines. This is an old problem, but it has deteriorated in the past decade: As recently as 2013, the country built thousands of miles of new transmission lines a year; in 2025, it is set to build about 400 miles. This problem’s opportunity cost has gotten worse over time: Because solar and especially wind resources are more abundant in some places than others, the country’s overall ability to access cheap and zero-carbon electricity is limited by its ability to build new power lines.

We already have signs that this bottleneck is slowing clean energy deployment. The U.S. hit a record for new wind capacity deployment in 2020 and 2021, but the industry’s deployment has slowed since then. This was not, until recently, due to any lack of support from the federal government — in fact, the Biden administration was quite solicitous of wind — but because we may have started to run out of windy places with ample transmission capacity in the United States.

This bottleneck has become politically urgent in the age of load growth and AI data centers, and policymakers have proposed a number of policies to deal with it. They have come up with four big ideas.

The first is to strengthen FERC’s ability to backstop new power lines. Under federal law, FERC has a limited authority to approve new transmission lines in designated high-priority areas, but a much broader “one-stop shop” ability to approve new interstate natural gas pipelines. As a consequence, it is much easier to move natural gas around the country than electricity. Perhaps FERC’s ability to approve and expedite new power lines could be made more similar to its pipeline authority.

The second is a transmission tax credit — likely an investment tax credit that could cover something like 30% of the cost of a new transmission line. This would be especially useful for merchant developers who believe it would be profitable to build a large-scale clean energy resource and connect it to a congested region of the grid.

Third, a way of standardizing who pays for and who benefits from new transmission lines. Right now, utilities and power producers must essentially divide up the costs and benefits of a new power line on an ad hoc basis. A standard calculation — backed by the federal government — could ease that negotiation and make it clear where new lines would make the most sense.

Finally, some policy to “force” a transmission buildout and solve siting issues. You could imagine this happening in at least two different ways. One way is a legislated minimum transfer requirement — a mandate that every grid be able to transfer a certain amount of load to its neighbors. That would essentially mandate the construction of new lines, which could then be built by utilities or merchant transmission developers. Another would be to establish a new interregional transmission planning authority. This presumably federal body would plan, contract, and build a new high-voltage, direct current “backbone” grid for the country — it would, essentially, treat electricity transmission infrastructure as a critical resource on par with the interstate highway system.

Although this approach might sound like central planning — and, admittedly, it is central planning — one of the country’s biggest and most laissez-faire power markets has found success by preemptively planning and building transmission infrastructure. In 2005, Texas passed a state law to build new high-voltage transmission lines to promising areas for new wind farms. This investment anticipated future wind investment, based partly on the idea that while wind farms take only a few years to construct, transmission lines could take five to seven years. (That number has since gotten worse.) Ultimately, that law is credited with bringing on more than 18 gigawatts of wind power to the Texas grid.

Once you move beyond these two big issues, you get to a series of problems which I would describe as more imminent areas of bipartisan interest, but with no clear policy solution yet.

The first is executive discretion. Is there some way for Congress to limit a POTUS’s ability to tamper with energy projects that had already been approved by the relevant executive agency, as Biden did with the Keystone XL pipeline and Trump has done with offshore wind farms? I should add that between writing this speech and delivering it, this might have found a bipartisan policy solution — the SPEED Act, which passed late last month out of the House Natural Resources Committee, contains text meant to constrain future legislators.

The second is trade. The Trump administration has shown it is far more willing to raise trade barriers than previous administrations, and Democrats have noticed. Could trade barriers be enacted in a more bipartisan way, and could they advance other economic or decarbonization goals? Namely, should the U.S. adopt a carbon border adjustment fee, as the European Union is doing? Should we integrate our “trading club” with Europe’s, for climate or security reasons? What would such a fee look like in the absence of a domestic carbon price?

The third is electricity. As I have discussed, after years of stagnation, the AI boom and electrification have turned the power grid into a far more interesting and dynamic energy system. I also mentioned that some owners of regulated utilities, such as Warren Buffett, are concerned about the utility sector’s future investability.

This is giving way to more profound questions. If you want to connect your data center to the grid, should all customers pay for that? Or should you bear the costs alone? Should we auction off the ability to connect to the power grid? Should the federal government take a more forceful role in financing and permitting new power plants — particularly nuclear power plants, which both parties can find a reason to appreciate at the moment? Is there a broader role for public power agencies, either through the Federal Power Act or at the state level? Is the deregulated electricity market model breaking down — and if so, what should follow it?

The fourth is industrial policy, advanced manufacturing, and the question of economic competitiveness with China. At this point, most observers have realized, I hope, that China has a far more competitive and innovative vehicle sector — not just an electric vehicle sector, but vehicle sector — than the United States does. As has happened in other East Asian developmental states, the country has moved up the value chain — progressing from making car parts to assembling foreign cars to designing and building their own domestic cars — and it weds its own subsidized but competitive markets with the largest internal one-country market that global capitalism has ever seen.

This innovation has given rise to several questions — some of which the Inflation Reduction Act tried to answer in policy that has since been repealed — and some of which have never been satisfactorily answered.

They include: What kinds of investments will stimulate EV manufacturing, or indeed any kind of advanced manufacturing? China has begun to build impressive and highly automated factories, in part by iterating on improvements purchased from the West. What kind of investments will encourage automation and dispersion of advanced robotics into manufacturing in the United States? What other industries should see policies like 45X?

Batteries are widely understood as a new general-purpose technology. Does the U.S. need to conduct a research program to catch up to Chinese-level understanding of battery chemistries? Do we need a CHIPS Act for batteries?

The Trump administration has experimented with new forms of public ownership and public support for industrial companies, from the golden share in U.S. Steel to the mineral production backstops with LP Materials. Which of those policies will be retained, and which should be expanded or innovated on? What can partial federal ownership do that traditional public markets cannot?

Finally, we have the next frontiers for both parties. Republicans are coming off a successful spate of aggressive environmental deregulation. They are increasingly willing and eager to weaken the National Historic Preservation and Endangered Species Acts. How will the public interpret those efforts? Will environmentalists mount a more effective resistance than they did for, say, the Inflation Reduction Act’s repeal?

Democrats, meanwhile, are left asking: What is the next step of climate policy? Which IRA-style tax credits could have the biggest emissions impact at the lowest cost to consumers? Is an economy-wide emissions cap worth trading away, say, the Clean Air Act’s section 111 rules on power plants? And how should policy benefit electric vehicles when, by the way, such policies are likely to benefit Tesla? How do self-driving cars like Waymo fit into any of this?

I began by saying that both parties, but especially Republicans in the second Trump administration, have become quite confused in their energy policies. This has had downsides for the American economy, as we have heard. But it also means that this is the most open moment for energy policy creativity in the United States in at least a decade. Democrats and Republicans each had their shot in government to remake the energy system — and neither has been particularly thrilled by what followed. People are hungry for new ideas, new approaches.

The parties’ long-standing energy coalitions have become destabilized, as well. The rise of China and the Biden administration’s unpopularity has destabilized climate policy in the Democratic coalition. At the same time, Republicans’ rejection of renewables and their embrace of the Big Tech has altered how that party looks to the public — and will change further if the economy slows or if the backlash to AI data centers grows. For the first time since 2012, you can see the outline of an energy realignment.

Or maybe not. If you are trying to tell the future of energy and climate policy in 2026, start here: Americans are going to need a lot more electricity in the years to come, as cheaply and cleanly as we can get it. Meeting that challenge will almost certainly require public investment and regulatory reform, meaning neither party’s radical flank will see its dearest visions come true. But everyone’s well-being depends on the grid: Republicans cannot achieve their economic objectives — nor Democrats their climate goals — without a grid buildout. Our choice is to grow the grid or watch the lights go out.",https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MjYwNzExOS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTgwNzgzNDgwNn0.hssgoWPcmdUXB3n2HKkBPazD5w1jiViXhjFwRVA5gNo/image.jpg?width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C100%2C0%2C100,N,,2026-01-01 20:59:40.404225

JD Dillon: In 2025, Tigo Energy made significant progress in improving the installer experience and strengthening overall system quality.

One major milestone was surpassing 1,500 system engagements through the Green Glove programme, which continues to deliver value by supporting installers at every stage from design and deployment to safety validation and long-term performance. While the programme has historically been driven by commercial and industrial (C&I) projects, we began expanding Green Glove to the residential sector, where installer demand for proactive quality assurance is rapidly growing.

Internationally, Tigo also saw strong momentum in Europe, including expanded solar-plus-storage offerings in the Czech Republic, new residential solutions approved for use in Slovakia and rapid growth in markets like the UK. We also continued strengthening our open-ecosystem partnerships with companies such as Haier, Sonnen and EG4, ensuring installers and homeowners have flexible, interoperable options.

Finally, we laid important groundwork for the coming surge in US repowering. Aging systems and orphaned customers represent a real industry challenge. To address this, we focused on innovation that directly reduces installer friction. With that, we launched an Inverter Power Output Control (IPOC) feature that simplifies commissioning by allowing installers to set an inverter’s maximum AC output in software, eliminating the need to stock multiple models and reducing on-site uncertainty.

What challenges did you face this year, and how did you overcome them?

The solar industry continues to grapple with misconceptions around equipment reliability. This year reinforced the importance of collective responsibility to solar’s reputation. By doubling down on quality in design, installation, equipment, and service, we can help reduce negative project outcomes and strengthen customer trust.

All said, 2026 will require continuous improvement across the value chain is essential. Innovation is not optional; it’s how we make solar more predictable, more resilient, and more unified as the sector matures.

How do you think the growth of ‘mid-sized’ installers will change the US residential solar space?

Mid-sized regional installers, which we define as companies installing in fewer than three states or five cities (give or take), are positioned to play an increasingly important role in US residential solar. These companies have operational scale without the complexity of national players.

Larger entities often face challenges tied to things like overhead and workflow standardisation, while smaller companies may struggle with resource limitations or leave the industry altogether. Mid-sized installers, by contrast, focus on long-term relationships with homeowners and business owners, and they typically do not outsource their portfolios to operations and maintenance (O&M) providers. They have enough scale to be efficient but remain nimble, attentive and deeply rooted in their communities.

As quality and service become non-negotiable in a maturing market, mid-sized installers will remain central to the industry’s growth well beyond 2026.

Do you think 2026 will see increased attention towards repowering for the residential sector?

While I’m not well-versed in the end-of-life care for utility-scale repowering projects, I can say that we are deeply engaged in residential and C&I repowering. Generally speaking, the focus here should be on simplifying this process through better commissioning tools, innovative features like Inverter Power Output Control (IPOC), and partnerships that help installers confidently revive aging systems.

What would be the single most significant thing that could happen in 2026 that would advance either your own organisation or the wider market, or both?

2026 will separate the wheat from the chaff in important ways. Most notably through durability and quality.

For durability, solar companies—nearly the entire value chain in the US—will have to adapt to not having as many government incentives acting as artificial business accelerants. The companies that are good at minimising soft costs, driving efficiency and delivering consistent customer value are more likely to become the winners.

For quality, if you believe in the ‘Crossing the Chasm’ framework, an increasingly large number of US residential solar markets are approaching the tipping point. This follows the lead of other countries like Australia, where nearly 40% of dwellings are equipped with rooftop solar. Elsewhere, like the Netherlands, a similar figure shows that nearly one in three homes have solar. That said, as mainstream adoption takes hold, quality and service become non-negotiable, and solving for those business priorities is not the same as simply installing the cheapest possible solar panels and inverters.

Are you generally optimistic about what 2026 will bring?

Overall, yes. The industry is shifting toward a culture of continuous improvement that spans far beyond hardware quality. Software, service, commissioning processes and installer tools are all becoming central to competitive differentiation. This transition toward a more integrated, data-driven ecosystem is healthy for the market and ultimately better for customers.

We’re also encouraged by broader economic trends. As solar becomes more mainstream, its benefits extend further in supporting local job creation, stimulating regional economies and providing affordable clean energy to more communities. We also see solar increasingly bridging ideological divides as a practical, cost-effective energy solution.

In 2026, we anticipate a more mature and collaborative sector where quality, service and operational excellence define the leaders.",https://www.pv-tech.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/tigo-energy.jpg,N,,2025-12-31 07:59:02.654291

T1 sold 725MW of modules in the third quarter of this year, and expects to begin commercial operation at a tunnel oxide passivated contact (TOPCon) cell manufacturing facility next year as it looks to build a domestic solar supply chain in the US.

“Validating our ability to monetise these credits is an important step for T1 as we continue to invest in advanced American manufacturing and grow our domestic production capacity at G1_Dallas, which is fully ramped, and at G2_Austin, our US solar cell fab that is now under construction,” said T1 chief financial officer Evan Calio.

The tax credits have been sold at a ratio of US$0.91 per dollar of PTC generated, which puts the sale in line with other tax credit deals that have been signed this year in the US solar sector. In June, SEG Solar and First Solar both completed deals at a ratio of US$0.94 per PTC dollar, the latter deal helping to push First Solar’s total tax credits sold over US$2 billion.

T1 Energy advances ‘FEOC-compliant’ supply chain

Yesterday, T1 also announced that it had completed deals with Trina Solar “and other parties” to ensure its compliance with the US’ foreign entity of concern (FEOC) regulation, which prohibits companies from benefitting from tax credits if they use components from companies based in or owned by countries deemed to be a threat to US security.

While this technically includes China, Iran, Russia and North Korea, the former’s dominance of the global solar manufacturing industry means that US solar companies have had to ensure their products are not made with components made in China in order to secure tax credit support. T1, for its part, has invested “significant capital” into debt repayments to Trina Solar, bringing the percentage of the company’s debt held by Trina Solar to within the FEOC compliance threshold, according to T1.

Historically, T1 also licensed patents and intellectual property from Trina Solar, which could compromise FEOC compliance. However, T1 noted that Trina Solar has since sold this intellectual property to India-headquartered Evervolt, from which T1 is now licensing the intellectual property, which would make T1’s work FEOC-compliant.

T1 also argued that it has purchased solar cells to be used in module production in 2026 from a “non-FEOC” manufacturer, but did not name this company; T1 also emphasised that much of its 2026 manufacturing work will use components and materials made in the US, either from T1’s own facilities or from fellow US companies Nextpower and Corning.

Tesla’s decision to publish delivery estimates signals management expects weaker sales than many investors had anticipated.

The company is on pace for a second straight annual decline in vehicle deliveries despite late-year demand surges tied to expiring tax credits.

Tesla stock remains up for the year, though it continues to lag the broader market.

Tesla has published a series of analyst sales estimates on its website, an uncommon move that suggests fourth-quarter vehicle deliveries may fall short of broader market expectations.

The company posted figures on its website showing that analysts on average expect Tesla to deliver 422,850 vehicles in the fourth quarter, a 15% decline from a year earlier. That compares with a Bloomberg-compiled average of 440,907 vehicles, which represents an 11% drop.

Tesla’s investor relations team has long compiled delivery estimates and shared them selectively with analysts and investors, but the company has not previously published the figures publicly. Gary Black, co-founder of Future Fund Advisors, described the move as highly unusual, suggesting it was intended to distribute Tesla’s internal consensus as widely as possible. He said deliveries are likely to land near 420,000 vehicles.

The disclosure comes as Tesla is on track for a second consecutive annual decline in vehicle sales. The company’s internal estimates indicate about 1.6 million deliveries for the year, down more than 8% from a year earlier. Tesla’s delivery projections for the next three years are also below averages compiled by Bloomberg.

Additionally, Tesla shares fell as much as 1.3% on Tuesday after the estimates were published, then recovered to erase the decline.

The sales slowdown earlier in the year followed Tesla’s decision to retool production lines at each of its assembly plants for the redesigned Model Y, the company’s best-selling vehicle. That period also coincided with CEO Elon Musk’s polarizing role in the Trump administration.

Deliveries rebounded to a record in the third quarter as U.S. consumers rushed to buy electric vehicles ahead of the expiration of $7,500 federal tax credits at the end of September. Tesla later sought to offset the loss of those incentives by introducing lower-priced versions of the Model Y sport utility vehicle and Model 3 sedan, each priced under $40,000.

Slate Auto has assembled a team of EV engineers from Tesla, Rivian and elsewhere to develop America's least-expensive EV truck. In the warehouse space near construction supply shops and a Western-themed bar, designers have built clay models and prototypes of a customizable EV truck that could cost half as much as the competition.

The company, which has raised more than $700 million from Amazon's Jeff Bezos and others, says it will have a truck on the market next year for roughly $25,000.

How does it plan to keep its sticker price so low?

Buyers will start with a blank slate — a basic truck without power windows or even paint — and can then customize it however they like.

They can pay extra for power windows, speakers, colored wrap or paint. A $5,000 kit even converts the truck into an SUV.

Squeezing out as much cost as possible while making it as easy as Legos to snap on different options has required complex engineering, which is why the company decided to set up its design studio in Southern California.

The region is full of experts.

Although Slate's headquarters is in Troy, Mich., and its vehicles will be manufactured in Indiana, much of how they will look and be assembled came together in the Los Angeles area, said Jeremy Snyder, Slate's chief commercial officer.

""The design presence on the West Coast, specifically in Los Angeles, has been a huge part of the automotive industry for a very long time,"" he said. ""Having that pool of talent that resides here was super important.""

If the idea clicks with enough consumers, company executives are hopeful that their unique business model will bolster widespread EV adoption.

Skeptics say it has yet to be proved that American consumers really want a vehicle broken down to the basics, but thousands of potential EV owners already have shown interest.

More than 150,000 potential buyers put down $50 deposits to reserve their place in line to buy the truck once it is on the market.

A large slice of that demand is coming from Los Angeles, Snyder said.

""Los Angeles has played such a critical role in the zero-emissions auto industry,"" he said. ""I think that it is going to play a very important role in the roll-out of Slate vehicles.""

The company's first deliveries are expected in late 2026.

Slate is entering the EV market at a difficult moment, as demand for green cars has cooled under the Trump administration. The president ended many tax breaks and regulations that were created to nudge more consumers and companies into EVs.

The EV company Rivian laid off more than 600 workers in October, and Tesla sales have slid this year.

Tesla has shown how tough it is to build a business around an affordable EV by putting its own affordable vehicle plans on the back burner.

These days, Elon Musk seems more focused on developing humanoid robots for the masses than on an affordable EV.

Slate thinks that for a radically reduced price, there will be demand. It is imagining that there are customers who don't need four doors, the size or the power of a standard truck or the autonomous driving tech of a Tesla.

Slate's big bet is that a radically reduced sticker price and a new kind of business model can rekindle excitement about the industry. The company is hoping that customers will be thrilled to save the money and then splurge only on the features they want.

""We're going to make the truck, and then after that, you make it yours,"" said Slate's head of communications, Jeff Jablansky.

Slate trucks have a steel frame and external plastic panels that can be wrapped in any color. If customers want to paint their vehicle, they can do it themselves or take it to a partner shop.

The standard version will have an electric range of 150 miles. That can be increased to 240 miles by paying more for a bigger battery.

And those are some of the most obvious options.

Slate's online customization tool gives customers the freedom to design their EV however they want. Jablansky said potential customers have created more than 10 million different configurations of a Slate truck online.

Slate hopes that if it can make EVs more affordable to buy, a new group of consumers will get to experience that EVs also often cost less to own and maintain.

""The entire company was built around this idea of the affordable vehicle,"" Snyder said. ""We scrutinize every accessory in the same way that we scrutinize the vehicle to keep prices as low as possible.""

Although only about 25 of Slate's 500 employees work out of the Long Beach studio, it has a disproportionate effect on the company's product.

To trailblaze and succeed in the harsh EV market, the company decided it needed a presence in California, as well as near the traditional heart of car building in and around Detroit.

""We knew we needed to have a presence in both places to really understand what people wanted,"" Jablansky said. ""Some companies say they're a California company, some say they're a Detroit company. We need to be an American company.""

I’ve spoken to energy workers in Louisiana.
One message was clear: American energy workers are hurting from the slow permitting processes.
This was a parting gift to left-wing environmentalists, not Louisiana workers and families.
President Trump also signed an Executive Order in April to restore competitiveness to the American seafood industry and strengthen U.S. fishing.","Before the sun even rises, people are hard at work every day in South Louisiana—from the energy worker in Houma checking equipment and reviewing safety logs to the shrimper pushing off from the docks. They keep our lights on, our restaurants full, and our economy strong. My job is to keep that rhythm alive by supporting Louisiana fishermen and offshore energy workers—making life better for the men and women who rise before dawn to keep our state prosperous. That is my goal, and that is President Trump’s goal.

In President Trump’s Working Families Tax Cuts bill, we expanded offshore lease sales for the next 15 years. Through GOMESA—a law which shares federal oil and gas revenues from the Gulf of America with Alabama, Mississippi, and Texas, as well as Louisiana—I worked to make sure our state got more than our fair share. Because of that work and President Trump’s partnership, Louisiana will now receive an extra $46 million per year for coastal restoration. You can’t fish or produce energy without a healthy coast—something families from Lafourche to Vermilion Parish understand firsthand. I’ve spoken to energy workers in Louisiana. In May, President Trump invited me to join him at the White House as he discussed the incredible investments pouring into America that will benefit Louisiana, energy independence, and the families and workers who power this country.

This year, I also hosted an energy summit in New Orleans to talk about the future of energy in our state. One message was clear: American energy workers are hurting from the slow permitting processes. So, I introduced the REPAIR Act to make sure energy, manufacturing, and infrastructure projects aren’t held up by frivolous lawsuits after permits are already approved. This bill makes the review process faster, sets up a way for developers and agencies to work out issues directly, and helps projects move forward quickly. Otherwise, we’re wasting taxpayer dollars and hurting workers still recovering from President Biden’s war on American energy.

Just before he left office, President Biden delivered one final blow by banning new domestic offshore oil and gas exploration, threatening thousands of jobs. This was a parting gift to left-wing environmentalists, not Louisiana workers and families.

Under President Trump and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, the difference is night and day. On day one, President Trump and Republicans promised to unleash

American energy. We delivered. For the first time in years, we held a massive offshore lease sale in New Orleans. Not to mention, the Trump Administration’s Bureau of Ocean Energy Management already announced a second one. This is a direct result of my work with President Trump on his Working Families Tax Cuts bill. It will unlock 80 million acres in the Gulf, lower energy costs, and create good-paying jobs that support households throughout Lafayette and the greater Acadiana region.

President Trump also signed an Executive Order in April to restore competitiveness to the American seafood industry and strengthen U.S. fishing. People come from all over to try Louisiana gumbo, jambalaya, and shrimp and grits. That’s because our shrimpers and catfish farmers meet high standards. I introduced legislation to protect Louisiana’s shrimpers and fishermen against India’s dumping of cheap shrimp and produce into U.S. markets. I’ve discussed these concerns with U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and worked for years to level the playing field for Louisiana seafood jobs. That work includes negotiating hundreds of millions for the Morganza to the Gulf levee protection project.

Louisianans know natural disasters all too well. Our coastal communities have taken a beating. We have the will to rebuild, but rebuilding takes resources. Through my work on the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, I delivered $11 billion of federal funding back to our state—$3.5 billion for coastal and mitigation projects. Tens of millions are going to South Louisiana to fix crumbling roads and broken bridges—think the Robinson Canal Bridge, Ducros Road, and Bayou Blue sidewalks.

The Bayou’s strong workforce is doing an incredible job. I’ve met with many of them—folks from SLEMCO—who get the lights back on quickly after the power goes out. Hard work like theirs gives families another reason to come to Louisiana and stay. As you are doing everything you can to make our state better—and you are succeeding—I am working every day to make life in Louisiana better. You should have money left over after the bills are paid, safe roads to drive on, and confidence your job is supported.

Louisiana is a great success story, and you are at the heart of it. Let’s keep the Gulf open, the jobs coming, and our communities protected for generations to come.","https://www.houmatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/12/09/NPPS/87685419007-bill-cassidy.jpeg?crop=198,112,x0,y70&width=198&height=112&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-12-31 06:57:42.255457

If the Democrats are in office, we move forward, if Republicans come in office, we move backwards?Bill McKibben:Yeah, in the largest terms.
And so for me, somebody who wants to have solar panels and wants to use solar power, it’s just not cost-effective.
We’ve never really seen anything like it.Al Letson:Do you think we’ll be able to bounce back?","Bill McKibben:For a very long time, all my life, we’ve called this stuff alternative energy, and it’s sort of been there on the fringe like maybe it’s not real big boy energy the way that oil and gas is. I think we’ve tended to think of it as the Whole Foods of energy. It’s like nice, but it’s pricey. It’s the Costco of energy now.Al Letson:Coming up on More To The Story, environmentalist, Bill McKibben on why the answer to all our energy problems is literally right above us. Don’t go anywhere.This is More To The Story. I’m Al Letson. Environmentalist Bill McKibben isn’t known for a sunny outlook on climate change, but Bill seems to have turned a corner with his new book, Here Comes The Sun: A Last Chance For the Climate and a Fresh Chance for Civilization. It’s an optimistic look at a renewable energy solution staring us right in the face, a solution that countries like China and Australia are making both affordable and accessible. In contrast, the Trump administration is rolling back efforts to make sustainable energy affordable while doubling down on the use of fossil fuels. It’s an effort that Bill says is leaving the United States in the Dark Ages.Bill, how are you this morning?Bill McKibben:I’m actually pretty darn good, which one feels bad about saying in the midst of planetary ecological trauma and the collapse of our democracy, but it’s a beautiful day in the mountains of Vermont and in the midst of all that bad stuff, I’ve got one piece of big good news, which it’s actually kind of fun to share.Al Letson:Yeah, I think in the midst of all the stress and pressure and sadness about the way the world is heading at this moment, I think having joy is a revolutionary act and it’s good. I think when you come outside and the sun is shining and it feels good outside, I don’t know. I don’t think we should be ashamed of it. I think we should bask it and hold onto it as long as possible because good Lord, who knows what’s next?Bill McKibben:Amen. One of the results of having spent my whole life working on climate change is I never take good weather for granted. If there’s a snowstorm, I make the most out of every flake. If there’s a beautiful cool fall-like morning like there was today, nobody’s out in it quicker than me. So I take your point 100%.Al Letson:How long have you been working in the field of environmental justice and thinking about the environment?Bill McKibben:Al, when I was 27, I wrote a book called The End of Nature, so this would’ve been 1989 because I’m an old person. So, wrote a book called The End of Nature that was the first book about what we now call the climate crisis, what we then call the greenhouse effect. And that book, well, that book did well, it came out in 24 languages and things, but more to the point, it just made me realize that this was not only the most important question in the world, what was going to happen to the Earth’s climate, but the most interesting, that it required some understanding of science, but also more importantly of economics, of politics, of sociology, of psychology, of theology, of pretty much everything you could imagine. And so for 38 years now, I guess, it’s been my work and at some level, I wish I’d been able to spend my life on something not quite so bleak. On the other hand, I have to confess, I haven’t been bored in any point in there.Al Letson:Yeah. How would you describe the environmental causes in America since you’ve been watching it for so long? It seems to me that there’s a lot of one step forward, three steps back, one step forward, three steps back.Bill McKibben:I’d say it’s been more like one step forward, three quarters of a step back over and over again. And that’s a big problem because it’s not only that we have to move, it’s that we have to move fast. Climate change is really probably the first great question we’ve ever come up against that has time limit. As long as I’ve been alive and as long as you’ve been alive, our country’s been arguing over should we have national healthcare? I think we should. I think it’s a sin that we don’t, people are going to die and go bankrupt every year that we don’t join all the other countries of the world in offering it, but it’s not going to make it harder to do it when we eventually elect Bernie and set our minds to it than if we hadn’t delayed all this time.Climate change isn’t like that. Once you melt the Arctic, nobody has a plan for how you freeze it back up again. So we’re under some very serious time pressure, which is why it’s incredibly sad to watch our country pretty much alone among the world in reverse right now on the most important questions.Al Letson:Yeah. Is that forward movement and regression tied to our politics, i.e., is it tied to a specific party? If the Democrats are in office, we move forward, if Republicans come in office, we move backwards?Bill McKibben:Yeah, in the largest terms. The fossil fuel industry, more or less purchased the Republican Party 30, 35 years ago. Their biggest contributors have been the Koch brothers who are also the biggest oil and gas barons in America. And so it’s just been become party doctrine to pretend that physics and chemistry don’t really exist and we don’t have to worry about them. Democrats have been better, and in the case of Joe Biden actually, considerably better. His Inflation Reduction Act was the one serious attempt that America’s ever made to deal with the climate crisis, and it was far from perfect, and there were plenty of Democrats like Joe Manchin that got in the way and so on and so forth. But all in all, it was a good faith effort driven by extraordinary activism around the Green New Deal. And it’s a shame to see it now thrown into reverse in the Trump administration, especially because the rest of the world is at different paces, some of them very fast, starting to do the right thing here.Al Letson:So given all of that where we are and kind of stepping back away from the progress we had made forward, you just wrote a new book that is pretty optimistic, which is a little bit different for you because you’ve been described as dark realism. Tell me why are you feeling optimistic in this moment?Bill McKibben:About 36 months ago, the planet began an incredible surge of installation of renewable energy, solar panels, wind turbines, and the batteries to store that power when the sun goes down or the wind drops. That surge is not just the fastest energy transition play on the planet now. It’s the fastest energy transition in history and by a lot, and the numbers are frankly kind of astonishing. I mean, the last month we have good data for is May. In China, in May, they were putting up three gigawatts of solar panels a day. Now, a gigawatt is the rough equivalent of a big coal-fired power plant. So they were building the equivalent of one of those worth of solar panels every eight hours across China. Those kind of numbers are world-changing if we play it out for a few more years, and if everybody joins in. And you can see the same thing happening in parts of this country.California has not done everything right, but it’s done more right than most places, and California has hit some kind of tipping point in the last 11 or 12 months. Now, most days, California generates more than a hundred percent of the electricity it uses from clean energy, which means that at night, when the sun goes down, the biggest source of supply on their grid is batteries that didn’t exist three years ago. And the bottom line is a 40% fall in fossil fuel use for electricity in the fourth-largest economy in the world is the kind of number that, adopted worldwide, begins to shave tenths of a degree off how hot the planet eventually gets. And we know that every 10th of a degree Celsius, that the temperature rises, moves another a hundred million of our brothers and sisters out of a safe climate zone and into a dangerous one. We’re not talking salvation here, we’re not talking stopping global warming, but we are talking the first thing that’s happened in the 40 years that we’ve known about climate change, that scales to at least begin taking a serious bite out of the trouble we’re in.Al Letson:Yeah, so I own a home in Jacksonville, Florida.Bill McKibben:In the Sunshine State.Al Letson:In the Sunshine State. I was planning on getting solar panels for the house, but then I was told A, one, it would be really expensive, and then B, it wouldn’t save me that much on my bill because of the way some local ordinances are configured. And so for me, somebody who wants to have solar panels and wants to use solar power, it’s just not cost-effective. So how do we get past that?Bill McKibben:Well, there’s a lot of ways. One of the ways was what Biden was doing in the IRA, which was to offer serious tax credits. And those, despite the Republican defeat of them, remain in effect through the end of this year through New Year’s Eve. So if people move quickly, they can still get those. Probably more important in the long run, and this was the subject of a long piece I wrote for Mother Jones this summer, we need serious reform in the way that we permit and license these things.Putting solar panels on your roof in Florida is roughly three times more expensive than it is to put solar panels on your roof in say, Australia, to pick someplace with a similar climate, or Europe, someplace with a more difficult climate, costs three times as much here. A little bit of that’s because of tariffs on panels. Mostly it’s because every municipality in America, they send out their own team of inspectors, permits, on and on and on. It’s a bureaucratic mess, and that’s what drives the price up so dramatically.There’s actually an easy way to do it. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory developed a piece of software called the Solar App Plus that allows contractors to just plug in the name of the type of equipment they’re going to put on the roof and the address that they’re doing it, and the computer quickly checks to see if it’s all compatible, and if it is, they get an instantaneous permit and get to work right away. And then, for apartment dwellers, because there’s almost as many apartment dwellers as homeowners in this country, who don’t have access to their own roof usually, we need another set of easy technology. We’re calling this balcony solar.And across Europe over the last three years, three and a half, 4 million apartment dwellers have gone to whatever you call Best Buy in Frankfurt or Brussels and come home for a few hundred euros with solar panel design just to be hung from the railing of a apartment balcony and then plugged directly into the wall. No electrician needed nothing. That’s illegal every place in this country except that progressive bastion in the state of Utah where the state legislature unanimously passed enabling legislation earlier this year because some Libertarian Republican state senator who I’ve talked to, an interesting guy, he said, “Well, if people in Stuttgart can have it, why not people in Provo?” And no one had a good reason, so now there’s on YouTube lots of videos of Happy Utahns putting up their balcony solar arrays.Al Letson:So let me just to clarify that because I never heard of this before. In overseas, in different countries, they can go to, I don’t know, an Ikea and grab a solar panel, come home and plug it in the wall to power their apartment?Bill McKibben:It often powers 25% of the power that they’re using in their apartment. It’s a real amazing thing and it’s for a few hundred euros. And among other things, it really introduces people to the joy of all this. There was a big story in The Guardian a few months ago following all sorts of people who’d done this and almost to a person, they’d all become fascinated by the app on their phone showing how much power they were generating at any given moment.Solar power is kind of a miracle. It exists in so many different sizes, from your balcony to big solar farms, all of which we need. But the thing that’s a miracle about it is precisely that it’s available to all of us. I mean, no one’s going to build a coal-fired power plant on their balcony. This is something that everybody can do, and it’s something that once you’ve got the panel, no one can control. We’re talking about energy that can’t be hoarded, that can’t be held in reserve, and that essentially the sun delivers for free every day when it rises above the horizon. So that is an extraordinary boon to especially poor people around the world and an extraordinary threat to the fossil fuel industry, which is why you’re seeing the crazy pushback that marks the Trump administration.Al Letson:Coming up, Bill says, the United States is woefully behind the rest of the world when it comes to solar power and renewable energy.Bill McKibben:That we’ve now gifted the future to China is just crazy no matter what your politics are.Al Letson:But before we get to that, we here at Reveal want to reach as many ears as possible and you, my friend, can help us do that.

Okay, don’t go anywhere. More coming up with Bill McKibben.This is More To The Story. I’m Al Letson. Environmentalist and author Bill McKibben is here to tell us why the sun is an obvious solution to our energy problems if only American politicians, including our president, we get on board.So with the Trump administration and this bill that they passed, The Big Beautiful Bill, that impacts tax credits for renewable projects like solar, how is that going to affect the solar power industry in the United States?Bill McKibben:It’s going to decimate it. There are already companies laying people off and going out of business because that tax credit was important and it’s, since we can’t do anything in Washington at the moment, why we need state and local governments to step up big to change the rules here and try to keep this momentum going in the States. The United States accounts for about 11% of emissions in the world. The other 89%, things are going much better than they are here, not just in China, but in all the places that China touches.In some ways, the most powerful story for me in the book was what happened in Pakistan last year. Now, Pakistan’s been hit harder by climate change than any country on earth. Its cities now routinely report temperatures of 125, 126 degrees. The two worst floods that really we’ve ever recorded on the planet happened in Pakistan over the last 15 years. Right now there’s big major, not quite as bad, but really serious flood across the Punjab. Pakistan also has an expensive and unreliable electric system. So about 18 months ago, people began importing in very large numbers, cheap Chinese solar panels from across their shared border. And within six months, eight months, Pakistanis, without government help, just basically using directions you can get on TikTok, had installed enough solar panels to equal half of the existing national electric grid in Pakistan. It’s the most amazing sort of citizen engineering project in history and of incredible value to people.Farmers in Pakistan, I don’t know if you’ve traveled in rural Asia, but the soundtrack of at part of the world is the hum of diesel pumps, often the cough of diesel generators because you need to bring up this irrigation water from quite a great depth to wells that came with the green revolution. Often for farmers, that diesel is the biggest single input cost that they have. So farmers were very early adopters here. Many of them lacked the money to build the steel supports that we’re used to seeing to hold your solar panels up. They just laid them on the ground and pointed them at the sun. Pakistanis last year used 35% less diesel than they did the year before. Now the same thing is happening in the last six months across large parts of Africa. Pretty much any place where there’s really deep established trade relations with China, and it’s not just solar panels.What the Chinese are also doing is building out the suite of appliances that make use of all that clean, cheap electricity. The most obvious example being electric vehicles and electric bikes. More than half the cars sold in China last month came with a plug dangling out the back, and now those are the top-selling cars in one developing nation after another around the world because they’re cheap and they’re good cars and because if you’re in Ethiopia or Djibouti or wherever you are, you have way more access to sunshine than you do to the incredibly long supply chain that you need to support a gasoline station.Al Letson:But my understanding, and my understanding is definitely dated, which is why I’m glad I’m talking to you, but for a very long time, my understanding of solar power was that it wasn’t that efficient, that you wouldn’t be able to get enough power to really do much of anything versus fossil fuels. Is it true that the Chinese have really invested in the technology and really pushed it forward?Bill McKibben:Yeah, I mean Chinese are now, you’ve heard of petro states, the Chinese are the first electro state in the world. This stuff works great and it works great here. I mean, I was telling you about what’s going on in California. In some ways, an even more remarkable story, given the politics, is that Texas is now installing clean energy faster than California because it’s the cheapest and it’s the fastest thing to put up. If you’re having to build data centers, and God knows, I’m not convinced we have to build as many data centers as we’re building, but if you do, the only thing that builds fast enough to get them up is solar or wind. You can put up a big solar farm in a matter of a few months as fast as you can build the dumb data center.Your question’s really important because for a very long time, all my life, we’ve called this stuff alternative energy, and it’s sort of been there on the fringe like maybe it’s not real big boy energy the way that oil and gas is. I think we’ve tended to think of it as the Whole Foods of energy. It’s like nice, but it’s pricey. It’s the Costco of energy now. It’s cheap, it’s available in bulk, it’s on the shelf ready to go. 95% of new electric generation around the world and around the country last year came from clean energy, and that’s precisely why the fossil fuel industry freaked out. You remember a year ago, Donald Trump told oil executives, “If you give me a billion dollars, you can have anything you want.” They gave him about half a billion between donations and advertising and lobbying. That was enough because he’s doing things even they couldn’t have imagined. I mean, he’s shut down two almost complete big wind farms off the Atlantic seaboard. I mean, it’s craziness. We’ve never really seen anything like it.Al Letson:Do you think we’ll be able to bounce back? As we’re watching all of these forward movements that have happened before Trump came back into office, it feels like he is burning it all down and not just burning it down, but salting the earth. Nothing’s going to grow there again.Bill McKibben:Yeah, I completely hear you. Yeah. This one possibility. Look, 10 years from now, if we stay on the course that Trump has us on, any tourist who can actually get a visa to come to America, it’ll be like a Colonial Williamsburg of internal combustion. People will come to gawk at how people used to live back in the olden days. I don’t think that that’s what’s going to happen. I think that at some point, reality is going to catch up with this, and everyone’s going to start figuring out we’re paying way more for energy than else in the world, and that means our economy is always on the back foot. That means that our consumers are always strapped. I mean, electricity prices are up 10% this year so far around this country because he keeps saying, “We’re not going to build the cheapest, fastest way to make more electricity.”I don’t see how that can last. But then I don’t see how any of this, none of it… I mean, I confess, I feel out of my depth now, the hatred of immigrants, the racial hatred, the insane economic policy around tariffs, none of it makes any real sense to me politically or morally. So I could be wrong, but I hope that America, which after all was where the solar cell was invented and where the first solar cell came out of Edison, New Jersey in 1954, the first commercial wind turbine in the world went up on a Vermont mountain about 30 miles south of where I’m talking from you speaking in the 1940s. That we’ve now gifted the future to China is just crazy no matter what your politics are.Al Letson:The idea that we are ceding ground to China is not just about solar energy, but in all sorts of ways. The move of the Trump administration to be sort of isolationists is actually hurting us way more than being open and growing and advancing.Bill McKibben:Yep, I couldn’t agree more. Look, I’ve been to China a bunch of times. I’m glad that I’m not a Chinese citizen because doing the work I do, I would’ve been in jail long ago, and I’m aware of that and understand the imperfections and deep flaws in that country. But I also understand that they have a deep connection to reason. They’ve elected engineers, or not elected, appointed engineers to run their country now for decades while we’ve been electing lawyers to run ours. And as a result, they’re not surprisingly better at building stuff. And so they have. And I think now, they’re using that to build a kind of moral legitimacy in the world. If the biggest problem the world faces turns out to be climate change, and I have no doubt that it is, then China’s going to be the global leader in this fight because we’ve just walked away from it.Al Letson:Yes. The question that comes to mind when you say that is, it’s clear to me that what some climate change skeptics and renewable energy skeptics have been able to do is to wrap things like solar power and wind energy into the culture war. So now that it’s a part of the culture war, people just stand against it because, well, they’re on the wrong team. Instead of looking at the economic reality that their bills could go down significantly if they dived in.Bill McKibben:It’s super true, but it’s also true that solar power is remarkably popular across partisan lines. The polling we have shows that yeah, the Republican voters are less enamored of it now because Trump’s been going so hard after it, but still like it by large margins and want more government support for it. I think the reason is that there are several ways to think about this. I’m concerned about climate change. I’m a progressive. I like the idea that we’re networking the groovy power of the sun to save our planet, but I’ve lived my whole life in rural America, much of it in red state, rural America. I have lots of neighbors who are very conservative. There’s lots of Trump flags on my road, and some of them fly in front of homes with solar panels on them because if you’re completely convinced that your home is your castle and that you’re going to defend with your AR-15, it’s a better castle if it has its own independent power supply up on the roof, and people have really figured that out.So this can cut both ways, and I hope that it will. That’s that story from Utah about the balcony solar. That’s the one place where people have said, “Well, there’s no reason not to do this. Let’s do it.”Al Letson:Yeah. So you’ve been doing this work for a really long time. I’m curious, when you started doing this work, could you have ever imagined the place that we are in right now as a country?Bill McKibben:No. Remember I was 27 when I wrote this first book, so my theory of change was people will read my book and then they will change. Turns out that that’s not exactly how it works. It took me a while to figure out. Really the story of my life is first 10 years after that, I just kept writing more books and giving talks and things because I thought being a journalist that we were having an argument and that if we won the argument, then our leaders would do the right thing because why wouldn’t they? Took me too long, at least a decade, to figure out that we had won the argument, but that we were losing the fight because the fight wasn’t about data and reason and evidence. The fight was about what fights are always about, money and power. And the fossil fuel industry had enough money and power to lose the argument, but keep their business model rolling merrily along.So that’s when I started just concluding that we needed to organize because if you don’t have billions of dollars, the only way to build power is to build movements. I started with seven college students, a thing called 350.org that became the first big global grassroots climate movement campaign. We’ve organized 20,000 demonstrations in every country on earth except North Korea. And in recent years, I’ve organized for old people like me, what we call Third Act, which now has about 100,000 Americans that work on climate and democracy and racial justice. And so this is a big sprawling fight, we don’t know how it’s going to come out. The reason I wrote this book, Here Comes the Sun, was just to give people a sense that all is not lost, that we do have some tools now that we can put to use.Al Letson:Bill McKibben is the author of Here Comes The Sun: A Last Chance For the Climate and a Fresh Chance for Civilization. Bill, thanks so much for talking to me today.Bill McKibben:Well, Al, many thanks to you and many thanks for really thoughtful questions.",https://i0.wp.com/revealnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/20251015_Bill-McKibben_2000px-scaled.png?fit=2560%2C1439&ssl=1,N,,2025-12-31 07:59:07.394849

The monthly refresh provides a complete update of the bank’s top recommendations across growth, income, value, and short investment strategies.

Cheniere Energy is among JPMorgan’s top energy picks. The liquefied natural gas exporter has established itself as a major player in the U.S. energy export market, operating LNG terminals in Louisiana and Texas that position it well for rising global demand for natural gas.

Cheniere Energy reported third-quarter 2025 earnings per share that beat analyst forecasts, although revenue came in below expectations. The company also received a credit rating upgrade to BBB+ from S&P Global Ratings, reflecting solid operational performance.

Entergy is also featured on JPMorgan’s list of preferred energy stocks. The utility serves roughly 3 million customers across Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas. Its regulated utility model provides stability and predictable returns, characteristics that appeal to income-focused investors.

Recently, Entergy completed a $1.3 billion offering of junior subordinated debentures. The Public Utility Commission of Texas also approved the company’s Cypress to Legend 500-kV transmission line project.

EQT Corp. is another JPMorgan energy pick. One of the largest natural gas producers in the United States, EQT has significant operations in the Appalachian Basin and a large resource base that underpins its production profile.

In a separate development, EQT’s President and CEO, Toby Z. Rice, made a personal strategic investment in Orbital Biocarbon, a company focused on sewage-sludge disposal facilities.

GE Vernova, the energy business spun off from General Electric, also features among JPMorgan’s favored energy names. The company is focused on electrification and renewable technologies, including wind turbines, grid solutions, and power conversion equipment.

GE Vernova recently received credit rating upgrades from both Fitch Ratings and S&P Global Ratings to BBB+ and BBB, respectively, with the agencies pointing to improved profitability and execution.

Targa Resources Corp. is included for its midstream energy exposure. The company specializes in the gathering, processing, and transportation of natural gas and natural gas liquids, with infrastructure spanning key U.S. energy basins.

Targa announced a definitive agreement to acquire Stakeholder Midstream for $1.25 billion in cash, expanding its footprint in the Permian Basin.

Vistra is another JPMorgan energy pick. The integrated power generation and retail electricity company operates across 20 states with a mix of conventional and renewable assets.

Vistra was recently upgraded to investment grade by S&P Global Ratings, which raised its issuer credit rating to BBB-. The company also cleared about 10,566 megawatts in the PJM Interconnection capacity auction for the 2027/2028 planning year.

JPMorgan’s Analyst Focus List represents a monthly refresh of their highest conviction ideas, replacing previous recommendations.

Investors should note that these selections reflect the current views of JPMorgan’s equity research team rather than a model portfolio, the bank said.

Wins for Adaptation Meanwhile, climate change adaptation is also attracting more funding.
As climate change brews more extreme weather events, catastrophe bonds are also emerging as a new tool to fund disaster preparedness.","Planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions kept rising in 2025 and country pledges to cut them are nowhere near where they need to be to avoid catastrophic climate change, but there were silver linings too.

The world is decarbonizing faster than was expected 10 years ago and investment into the clean energy transition, including everything from wind and solar to batteries and grids, is expected to have reached a new record of $2.2 trillion globally in 2025, according to research by the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, a London non-profit.

“Is this enough to keep us safe? No it clearly isn’t,” said Gareth Redmond-King, international lead at the ECIU. “Is it remarkable progress compared to where we were headed? Clearly it is.”

This was also the year when renewable power capacity reached new highs, batteries became cheaper than ever and an unprecedented level of protection for the high seas became a reality. Artificial intelligence made climate research faster and more efficient, and weather forecasting more precise. And even as the ravages of climate change became more apparent, economies and people were able to access a growing number of instruments to shield themselves.

Here’s a look at these and other investments, innovations and policy changes that went right for climate in 2025:

Clean Energy Boom

Global investment in clean tech far outpaced what went into polluting industries. For every $1 funding fossil fuel projects, $2 went into clean power, according to the ECIU. For China, the EU, the US and India, the four largest polluters, it was $2.60.

Funds flowing into renewable power set another record in the first half of this year and were up 10% compared to the same period in 2024, to $386 billion, according to the latest available research by BloombergNEF.

Solar and wind grew fast enough to meet all new electricity demand globally in the first three quarters of 2025, according to UK-based energy think tank Ember. That means renewable capacity is set to hit a new record globally this year, with Ember forecasting an 11% increase from 2024.

Over the past three years, renewable capacity grew by nearly 30% on average. That puts the world within reach of the goal set at COP 28 in Dubai in 2023 to triple clean power by 2030.

China is leading the charge, with the world’s largest polluter expected to have delivered 66% of new solar capacity, and 69% of new wind globally this year, according to Ember. Renewables also advanced in parts of Asia, Europe and South America.

AI’s Climate Benefit

The explosive power demand from artificial intelligence is also turning the tide on green technology investment, which had soured in recent years. For the first three quarters of this year, global clean tech investment, which was dominated by funding in next-generation nuclear reactors, renewables and other solutions that help power data centers, has already surpassed all of 2024. That marks the sector’s first annual increase since the 2022 peak.

And despite President Donald Trump’s rollback of climate policies, the S&P’s main gauge tracking clean energy is up about 50% this year, outperforming most other stock indexes and even gold. That same enthusiasm has also helped channel more capital into developing and upgrading the power grid, a backbone of the global energy transition.

The rise of artificial intelligence is also playing a role in enabling new climate solutions and expediting scientific research.

Waymo’s self-driving electric vehicles use AI to optimize route planning and minimize idling, reducing their carbon footprint. Bridge inspectors, meanwhile, deploy AI-enabled scanning systems to help safeguard critical infrastructure against extreme heat. AI is also helping scientists identify and count endangered species, and weather forecasters be more precise.

Cheaper Batteries

Battery prices, long a sticking point in the electrification of a range of products, continue to decline.

Prices per kilowatt-hour of battery capacity fell by 8% to a record $108 this year and they’re expected to decline a further 3% next year, according to BloombergNEF. The decrease is a result of better manufacturing, cheaper chemical recipes and a glut of production, factors that have outweighed higher prices for the metals that go into batteries.

The swooning prices improve the economics on a range of products from lawn mowers to commercial drones. Carmakers, in particular, will be able to spur EV adoption with longer range, lower cost vehicles.

The largest unlock will arguably be in utility-scale storage systems that bottle up energy from solar and wind farms and trickle it out during peaks in electricity demand.

The US Energy Information Administration estimates 18.2 gigawatts of storage capacity will have come online in 2025, which represents a 77% increase over the prior year and nearly one-third of the country’s new power. These facilities are now one of the cheapest options for utilities looking to build a power plant; soon, they’ll be cheaper still.

International Progress

In the year when Trump withdrew the US from the Paris Agreement and railed against clean tech, the global community scored some big wins.

Three years after being adopted, the so-called High Seas Treaty finally got the needed number of ratifications to come into force in January 2026. It will allow for the protection of the 60% of seas that don’t fall within any country’s jurisdiction, regulating what can and can’t be done in international waters for the first time ever.

It sets the framework for establishing marine protected areas and requires that environmental impact assessments be conducted for activities that could have a harmful or an unknown impact on the high seas. This comes at a time when there’s growing interest in using the ocean to absorb and store carbon dioxide and to mine the rare minerals sitting on its bed.

The International Court of Justice, meanwhile, issued a first-of-its-kind ruling in favor of climate action, which promises to transform the way that NGOs and campaigners hold governments to account. In July, the court determined that countries risk being in violation of international law if they don’t work towards keeping global warming to the 1.5C threshold agreed at the Paris climate conference in 2015. It’s an advisory opinion, but representatives for Vanuatu, the country that brought the case, said it could be used to put pressure on governments to do more on climate change.

Climate Policy

While the US rolled back its environmental policy, others pressed ahead. Australia, Denmark and the UK announced more ambitious emissions goals. While China was more timid in its goals, a majority of experts expect it to beat its target to cut emissions by 7 to 10% from peak levels by 2035, given the speed at which it’s expanding its clean energy capacity.

Global capitals historically dominated by cars have started to push back, seeking to encourage their residents to walk and cycle instead. Cities in Europe are further down this path, but in January, New York City introduced measures designed to dissuade drivers from entering certain parts of the city. By April it was already apparent that the change was reducing congestion and cutting journey times. More recently, researchers have found a 22% drop in harmful particulate pollution in the area where charges are enforced.

Overall, climate policy shows signs of becoming firmly embedded in national governmental policies, the ECIU found in its research. The Trump administration’s rollbacks on key climate and environmental regulations mean the share of the global economy covered by net zero targets fell to a little bit over 80%, down from more than 90% in 2024, but state-level targets and policies are holding the line and preventing that number from falling further.

Wins for Adaptation

Meanwhile, climate change adaptation is also attracting more funding. Billionaire philanthropist Bill Gates’s foundation announced in November that it will commit $1.4 billion over four years to expand access to innovations that help farmers in Africa and Asia become more resilient. This year’s UN annual climate summit also concluded with a new agreement to triple adaptation finance to $120 billion per year by 2035.

Hurricane Melissa — a tragedy that killed dozens of people in Jamaica and wiped out roughly 40% of the country’s annual economic output — also served as a dark example of how catastrophe bonds can help transfer part of climate risks to capital markets. The deadly storm triggered a full payout of Jamaica’s $150 million cat bond, easing doubts about whether such instruments work.

As climate change brews more extreme weather events, catastrophe bonds are also emerging as a new tool to fund disaster preparedness. These financial instruments, designed to pay out a specific amount if damage from climate-fueled natural disasters is severe, have traditionally been used to cover losses. But this year, hurricane-prone North Carolina has expanded the use case by issuing a new cat bond that incentivizes adaptation.

If no major losses occur, $2 million returns to the North Carolina Insurance Underwriting Association, the bond issuer, which then uses the money to help install wind-resistant “super roofs.” As more homeowners add these roofs, the annual pricing on the bond resets to factor in the changing exposure.

The new bond drew $600 million in investor interest, almost doubling its initial offering. NCIUA, which serves as the state-sponsored insurer in North Carolina, also expects the new resilient roofs to help lower insurance claims and cut back on reinsurance cost.

The result was a surge in flash floods – where overwhelming water meets inflexible design – turning sudden downpours into city-wide disasters,” Bhattarai said.","Devastating floods ravaged multiple regions of the world in 2025, from Southeast Asia to North America and the Middle East.

We asked climate experts what is causing the devastation and what governments should be doing to prevent the situation from becoming even worse in the coming year.

Which places were worst hit by floods in 2025?

“Throughout 2025, a series of major floods occurred worldwide, making flooding the year’s foremost climate hazard,” Pawan Bhattarai, assistant professor at the civil engineering department of Nepal’s Kathmandu-based Tribhuvan University, told Al Jazeera.

Here is a recap of some of the major floods that took place.

Gaza

Heavy downpours and freezing temperatures continue to ravage Gaza, where nearly 2 million people have been displaced during two years of Israeli bombardment that has destroyed much of the Strip.

Many people in Gaza are living in tents amidst rubble from destroyed homes and are largely unprotected from the strong winds and rain.

On Saturday, a polar low-pressure weather system carried particularly heavy rain and strong winds to the Gaza Strip. According to meteorologist Laith al-Allami, this is the third such system to affect the territory in the past few weeks, with a fourth which hit on Monday, Anadolu Agency reported.

One of the previous two was Storm Byron, which brought heavy rainfall and strong winds to Gaza as well as parts of Israel and the wider eastern Mediterranean region earlier this month.

Israel was placed on high alert for that storm – halting military leave, reinforcing emergency teams and safeguarding power supplies. But the UN said 55,000 Palestinian households in Israel lacking basic services and government support were left exposed.

At least 14 Palestinians in Gaza were killed in the storm, and several were injured. Among the victims was a newborn baby in al-Mawasi, who succumbed to freezing temperatures.

Morocco

Earlier this month, Morocco launched a nationwide emergency relief operation to support people affected by severe flooding as the country battled freezing conditions, torrential rains and snowstorms.

Flash floods killed at least 37 people and damaged about 70 homes and shops in the town of Safi, 300km (186 miles) south of the capital, Rabat.

Prosecutors are investigating whether shortcomings in infrastructure, such as poor drainage, played a role in the disaster.

Indonesia

Floods hit Indonesia in December, killing at least 961 people in Aceh, North Sumatra and West Sumatra. More than 20 villages across the ‍three provinces were completely swept away by the floods.

Homes, rice fields, dams and bridges were destroyed, leaving many areas inaccessible.

Illegal logging – often linked to the global demand for palm oil – along with forest loss due to mining, plantations and fires, both exacerbated the disaster in Sumatra.

Flooding was also reported in neighbouring Malaysia around the same time.

Thailand

At least 276 people have been killed in flooding in Thailand in December. The floods badly affected eight provinces in the central plains, four in the south and two in the north, according to the Thai Department of Disaster Prevention and Mitigation.

Sri Lanka

In late November, floods and landslides killed at least 56 people as Cyclone Ditwah, a deadly tropical storm, swept across Sri Lanka.

The heavy downpour which accompanied the storm destroyed four houses and damaged more than 600. It also caused trees and mud to fall and block multiple roads and railway lines.

Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake, who took office in September 2024, inherited painful austerity measures imposed by his predecessor, Ranil Wickremesinghe, as part of a bailout loan package from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), hampering rescue efforts.

“The storm poses a significant challenge to the government that is just beginning to address the social and economic concerns of the people,” Ahilan Kadirgamar, a senior lecturer at the department of sociology, University of Jaffna in Sri Lanka, told Al Jazeera in November.

Nepal

In October, severe floods and landslides hit parts of Nepal and India’s eastern Himalayan city of Darjeeling, killing at least 50 people.

This year’s rainfall was not record-breaking – overall, there was actually slightly less rain than in 2024, when the Kathmandu Valley saw its heaviest downpour since 2002. In the capital Kathmandu, some districts received just more than 145 mm of rain this year, compared with about 240 mm in late September 2024.

Damage was severe, however, because of “ultra-localised”, heavy rains.

The floods came one month after Nepal’s “Gen Z” protests in Kathmandu and other cities against corruption and nepotism. The protests prompted the deployment of the military and, ultimately, the resignation of Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli and his replacement by former Chief Justice Sushila Karki, 73, as interim PM.

While experts praised Karki for her interim government’s prompt early weather warnings before the flooding, widespread damage to critical infrastructure during the protests hindered rebuilding and relief operations.

“To prevent future disasters, a major shift in policy and practice is urgently needed. This must prioritise comprehensive watershed management, focusing on stabilising slopes and managing water run-off, which has been a persistently neglected area in our current approach to disaster risk reduction,” Bhattarai, the engineering professor, told Al Jazeera at the time.

Mexico

In October, floods hit Mexico, killing at least 66 people. Tropical storms caused flooding in five states in the country: Veracruz, Puebla, Hidalgo, Queretaro and San Luis Potosi.

More than 16,000 homes around the country were damaged.

Pakistan

Between June and August, several regions of Pakistan experienced flooding triggered by torrential rains. More than 700 people were killed around the country.

Floods devastated the Buner district in the northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. Gilgit-Baltistan, Pakistan-administered Kashmir, and the southern city of Karachi also suffered major flooding caused by high-intensity rains over a short period of time.

Rainfall continued in Pakistan and neighbouring countries until late August, and floods prompted the evacuation of 500,000 people in the Punjab province.

On August 31, a magnitude-6 earthquake hit Afghanistan near its border with Pakistan, killing more than 1,400 people, according to the government. Efforts to rescue people affected by the earthquake were hindered because flash floods had affected the Nangarhar province of Afghanistan, which borders Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.

United States

As of last week, more than 40 million Americans had been placed under winter storm warnings or weather advisories. Another 30 million have been alerted to flood or storm advisories in California, where a so-called “atmospheric river” has brought a deluge of rain.

An atmospheric river is a long, narrow band of air in the atmosphere that carries large amounts of water vapour.

Last week, thousands of flights in the US were cancelled because of winter storm Devin, which caused blizzards in the Midwest and northeast and heavy snow forecasts across parts of both regions.

Earlier in the year, several US states, including Texas, West Virginia, New Mexico and New Jersey, were hit by flash floods – sudden and rapid flooding of low-lying areas – in July.

These floods were mostly caused by heavy rainfall over a short period of time.

Flash floods in Texas killed more than 100 people in July 2025. Within two hours of flooding, the Guadalupe River breached its banks, with waters rising higher than two-storey buildings to about 9 metres (30ft).

Twenty-five girls and two counsellors were killed, and other people went missing when the floods hit the riverside Camp Mystic, a private Christian summer camp for girls.

The river has previously experienced major floods in 1936, 1952, 1972, 1973, 1978, 1987, 1991 and 1997, according to a guide prepared by the Guadalupe-Blanco River Authority, a Texas state agency dedicated to conserving the water resources of the river basin.

The 1987 deluge was particularly disastrous and also hit a summer camp, killing 10 teenagers at the Pot O’ Gold Christian Camp near Comfort, Texas, according to local media. But the National Weather Service (NWS) said in July this year, the Guadalupe River rose beyond 1987 levels.

So, were the 2025 floods worse than in previous years?

In some places, yes.

In the US, for example, flooding does appear to have worsened steadily for the past few years. The period between January and September 2025 saw the highest number of flood and flash flood events and the highest number of associated human casualties in five years, Nasir Gharaibeh, a civil and environmental engineering professor at Texas A&M University, told Al Jazeera.

From January to September, there were 7,074 floods in the US, which caused 242 deaths, according to the Storm Events Database, which is managed by the US National Weather Service (NWS) of the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).

For the same period last year, there were 6,551 floods, which resulted in 151 deaths. In 2023, there were 5,783 floods, which caused 93 deaths for the same period. In 2022, 4,548 floods caused 102 deaths.

However, experts said that in other regions in the world, 2025 was not much worse than previous years.

“There have been equally dramatic years in South Asia and East Asia,” Daanish Mustafa, a professor in critical geography at King’s College, London, told Al Jazeera.

“Nowhere did I hear that any flood flow record was broken. It’s just that flood plains were more urbanised, rivers more regulated, where the regulatory infrastructure failed, as in Sri Lanka and India,” said Mustafa.

Why were floods so severe in 2025?

Flooding was worsened by a variety of factors in 2025, experts told us throughout the year. “Flooding is a complex hazard. It occurs because of interactions between many variables related to weather, infrastructure, land cover and topography and other factors,” Gharaibeh said.

Climate change is a major factor in causing weather events, researchers say. “The specific triggers varied from city to city in 2025, yet a single, universal force magnified them all: Climate change, which supercharges rainfall extremes,” said Bhattarai.

Climate change is causing monsoon rains to intensify, for example, resulting in more frequent extreme precipitation events. This is because rising temperatures cause the atmosphere to hold more moisture, leading to heavier downpours during storms.

In northern Pakistan, these higher temperatures are also accelerating glacial melting, which increases the likelihood of glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs).

Furthermore, Abdullah Ansari, a research professor at the Earthquake Monitoring Center at Sultan Qaboos University in Muscat, Oman, told Al Jazeera, “research has shown that seasonal rains and weather conditions can intensify earthquake-induced vulnerabilities by triggering landslides, damaging access routes and disrupting communication lines.”

“The year was further distinguished by unusual patterns, including late-season monsoon floods, rare cyclonic activity, and extreme rainfall in regions not traditionally prone to flooding,” Bhattarai said.

But climate change is not the full story.

“This global driver met a local vulnerability: Urban landscapes fundamentally unequipped for the new reality. The result was a surge in flash floods – where overwhelming water meets inflexible design – turning sudden downpours into city-wide disasters,” Bhattarai said.

“While climate change plays a critical role in intensifying flooding events in Pakistan, other factors such as urbanisation, deforestation, inadequate infrastructure, and poor river management also contribute significantly,” Ayyoob Sharifi, a professor and urban scientist at Hiroshima University in Japan, told Al Jazeera in August.

Additionally, a lack of adequate drainage systems and early warning systems can exacerbate the effects of flooding.

A rise in the number of flash floods has also caused greater damage.

“In the US, we are seeing a higher number of flood-related casualties, in part due to an increase in rainfall-induced flash flooding,” Gharaibeh told Al Jazeera.

“Flash floods often occur with little warning, and the flood water flows with high velocities and destructive force, making them among the most dangerous natural hazards,” he added, explaining that the level of danger is measured by the ratio of deaths to people affected.

Overall, Bhattarai described the catastrophic flooding of 2025 as “a collision of intense meteorological events and long-term human decisions”.

“On the weather side, the primary drivers have been cloudbursts and stalled rain systems. These phenomena deliver short-duration, high-intensity rainfall, resulting in record daily rainfall totals that overwhelm drainage systems in a matter of hours.”

But human development has dramatically amplified the damage caused by floods, he said.

“Decades of river encroachment and floodplains converted into urban land have eliminated nature’s safety buffers. Rivers, now constricted and unable to spread out, surge with greater force and speed into populated areas that were once natural absorption zones.

“Essentially, we have built cities in the path of the water and then removed all its escape routes, turning heavy rain into disastrous floods.”

How can we improve flood responses in future?

Experts say governments will have to adapt to new weather patterns, which are resulting in more frequent and intense rainfall and flooding – and will have to change their approach to surviving floods.

Mustafa said: “Societies are continuing on their path of trying to fight floods, regulate rivers and build obstructive infrastructure in flood plains. All of these efforts have always failed and caused destruction and always will. But I fear the societies will continue apace.

“Don’t try to fight floods; learn to live with them. Don’t try to control and restrict river flows, give rivers room to flow,” he advised.

“Societies can and have engineered away high-frequency, low-intensity events. But in the process, they’ve made low-frequency, high-intensity events much worse. And this is particularly destructive in the climate change present, where all of your historical patterns, which are the basis of infrastructural design, are meaningless.”

Mustafa explained that infrastructure such as dams, levees and barrages are built to handle floods of a certain size and frequency.

He explained that these are built for 100-, 500- or 1,000-year events, meaning events with 1 percent, 0.5 percent or 0.1 percent chance of recurrence in any given year, respectively. He added that most infrastructure is designed for 100-year events.

Engineers use records of natural disasters to build this infrastructure.

“Assumption is that historical trends will continue into the future. With climate change, that assumption doesn’t hold,” Mustafa said.

Bhattarai said the 2025 floods underscored the need for faster, community-focused responses with clear local warnings, stronger coordination, urban-specific plans, protection of vulnerable groups and safer rebuilding that reduces future flood risks.

Gharaibeh said appropriate solutions will vary, depending on which part of the world is experiencing the flooding.

“Some parts of the world should start investing in their flood control infrastructure, including roadway systems, where roads are used as ‘drainage channels’. Other parts of the world should invest in building better warning systems.”

Gharaibeh explained that since funding is usually limited, controlling floods requires prioritisation of investment.

“Countries like the United States and Japan, for example, have built – and continue to build – robust flood control infrastructure because they have a long history of flooding issues.”

Even so, recent flash flood events, such as the flood that affected Texas in 2025, indicate that countries like the US should invest more in building better warning systems.

“On the other hand, Middle Eastern countries, for example, appear to lack the necessary infrastructure to control flooding. These countries should start investing in their flood control infrastructure.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/AP25335400418516-1767005775.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,N,,2025-12-31 07:59:11.513751

The state's move away from coal power and the use of cleaner vehicles are major factors in the improvement.

Despite air quality gains, some groups express concern over environmental agency budget and staffing cuts.

In a year when federal ""forever chemical"" regulations took a step backward and protections for isolated and semi-dry wetlands were watered down by Republicans in both Washington and Raleigh, finding positive North Carolina environmental news in 2025 might not seem easy.

But in December the N.C. Department of Environmental Quality said there's one reason Tar Heel residents should breathe a little easier.

State regulators announced that air quality in North Carolina is now the cleanest it's been in decades, continuing a decades-long trend of improving conditions.

“Even as our population and economy continue to grow, North Carolina’s air quality keeps getting better and better,” said DEQ Secretary Reid Wilson. “By controlling air pollution, we are giving every North Carolinian a cleaner, healthier future.”

According to the latest update to the state's ""Air Quality in North Carolina"" report, statewide emissions of carbon monoxide and sulfur dioxide, in particular, reached all-time lows in 2022, the latest year for which data are available from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

The report states that between 1990 and 2022, emissions fell 95% for sulfur dioxide, 74% for carbon monoxide, 48% for fine particles, and 67% for volatile organic compounds.

Overall, from 2005 to 2020, North Carolina reduced its gross and net greenhouse gas emissions by 28% and 38%, respectively. During this same period, the state’s population and real gross economic output grew by 20% and 23%, respectively, according to the air report.

Poor air quality is a major cause of asthma and can also exacerbate a host of other health problems, including contributing to heart and lung conditions.

Officials credit North Carolina's move away from coal-fired power plants as a major contributor to the air quality improvements, as well as ""cleaner"" vehicles and trucks hitting the state's roads.

But some groups say the overall trend for North Carolina when it comes to protecting and enhancing the environment isn't heading in the right direction.

According to the Environmental Integrity Project, from 2010 to 2024, N.C. environmental regulators suffered the largest staffing cuts, by percentage, of any state environmental agency in the U.S., losing nearly a third of its staff, or 386 jobs. State lawmakers and governors slashed the agency’s annual budget by 32%, shrinking the department's budget from $159 million to $108 million, when adjusted for inflation.

In its report, the group especially focused on poultry and hog factory farms in Eastern North Carolina and the sheer amount of waste these operations create.

Drew Ball with the Natural Resources Defense Council said he’s especially worried about the state’s low-lying communities like Wilmington and Fayetteville because everything flows downstream.

“We need to think a lot harder about keeping track of potential pollution and what it could mean for downstream communities,” he said.

I’ve spoken to energy workers in Louisiana.
One message was clear: American energy workers are hurting from the slow permitting processes.
This was a parting gift to left-wing environmentalists, not Louisiana workers and families.
President Trump also signed an Executive Order in April to restore competitiveness to the American seafood industry and strengthen U.S. fishing.","Before the sun even rises, people are hard at work every day in South Louisiana—from the energy worker in Houma checking equipment and reviewing safety logs to the shrimper pushing off from the docks. They keep our lights on, our restaurants full, and our economy strong. My job is to keep that rhythm alive by supporting Louisiana fishermen and offshore energy workers—making life better for the men and women who rise before dawn to keep our state prosperous. That is my goal, and that is President Trump’s goal.

In President Trump’s Working Families Tax Cuts bill, we expanded offshore lease sales for the next 15 years. Through GOMESA—a law which shares federal oil and gas revenues from the Gulf of America with Alabama, Mississippi, and Texas, as well as Louisiana—I worked to make sure our state got more than our fair share. Because of that work and President Trump’s partnership, Louisiana will now receive an extra $46 million per year for coastal restoration. You can’t fish or produce energy without a healthy coast—something families from Lafourche to Vermilion Parish understand firsthand. I’ve spoken to energy workers in Louisiana. In May, President Trump invited me to join him at the White House as he discussed the incredible investments pouring into America that will benefit Louisiana, energy independence, and the families and workers who power this country.

This year, I also hosted an energy summit in New Orleans to talk about the future of energy in our state. One message was clear: American energy workers are hurting from the slow permitting processes. So, I introduced the REPAIR Act to make sure energy, manufacturing, and infrastructure projects aren’t held up by frivolous lawsuits after permits are already approved. This bill makes the review process faster, sets up a way for developers and agencies to work out issues directly, and helps projects move forward quickly. Otherwise, we’re wasting taxpayer dollars and hurting workers still recovering from President Biden’s war on American energy.

Just before he left office, President Biden delivered one final blow by banning new domestic offshore oil and gas exploration, threatening thousands of jobs. This was a parting gift to left-wing environmentalists, not Louisiana workers and families.

Under President Trump and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, the difference is night and day. On day one, President Trump and Republicans promised to unleash

American energy. We delivered. For the first time in years, we held a massive offshore lease sale in New Orleans. Not to mention, the Trump Administration’s Bureau of Ocean Energy Management already announced a second one. This is a direct result of my work with President Trump on his Working Families Tax Cuts bill. It will unlock 80 million acres in the Gulf, lower energy costs, and create good-paying jobs that support households throughout Lafayette and the greater Acadiana region.

President Trump also signed an Executive Order in April to restore competitiveness to the American seafood industry and strengthen U.S. fishing. People come from all over to try Louisiana gumbo, jambalaya, and shrimp and grits. That’s because our shrimpers and catfish farmers meet high standards. I introduced legislation to protect Louisiana’s shrimpers and fishermen against India’s dumping of cheap shrimp and produce into U.S. markets. I’ve discussed these concerns with U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and worked for years to level the playing field for Louisiana seafood jobs. That work includes negotiating hundreds of millions for the Morganza to the Gulf levee protection project.

Louisianans know natural disasters all too well. Our coastal communities have taken a beating. We have the will to rebuild, but rebuilding takes resources. Through my work on the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, I delivered $11 billion of federal funding back to our state—$3.5 billion for coastal and mitigation projects. Tens of millions are going to South Louisiana to fix crumbling roads and broken bridges—think the Robinson Canal Bridge, Ducros Road, and Bayou Blue sidewalks.

The Bayou’s strong workforce is doing an incredible job. I’ve met with many of them—folks from SLEMCO—who get the lights back on quickly after the power goes out. Hard work like theirs gives families another reason to come to Louisiana and stay. As you are doing everything you can to make our state better—and you are succeeding—I am working every day to make life in Louisiana better. You should have money left over after the bills are paid, safe roads to drive on, and confidence your job is supported.

Louisiana is a great success story, and you are at the heart of it. Let’s keep the Gulf open, the jobs coming, and our communities protected for generations to come.","https://www.shreveporttimes.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/12/09/NPPS/87685419007-bill-cassidy.jpeg?crop=198,112,x0,y70&width=198&height=112&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-12-31 11:00:05.617384

USA, Indiana: RWE and Indiana Michigan Power Company (I&M), part of American Electric Power (AEP), are joining forces to meet Indiana’s rising electricity demand. The companies have signed a long-term power purchase agreement (PPA) for the full output of RWE’s 200 MW Prairie Creek project in Blackford County. Under the 15-year agreement, I&M will buy electricity from Prairie Creek, supporting an all-of-the-above energy strategy to ensure reliable and diverse generation.

Once operational in 2028, Prairie Creek will generate enough electricity to power around 42,000 homes, providing affordable and dependable energy for I&M customers while supporting Indiana’s growing industrial needs.

Ingmar Ritzenhofen, Chief Commercial Officer at RWE Clean Energy, said: “Our investment in Prairie Creek will deliver lasting benefits to Blackford County through economic development payments and long-term tax revenue funding for schools, roads, first responders and other essential services, while providing a stable source of income for local multigenerational farming families.”

Steve Baker, President and COO at I&M, added: “The addition of diverse, affordable energy resources is an important step in being Future Ready to serve customers’ homes, businesses and factories now and the years to come.”

Construction is already underway at the Prairie Creek site, employing around 240 workers at peak. Local landowners also benefit from lease payments, helping sustain agricultural operations and contributing to the local economy. Over its lifetime, the project will generate $60 M in property taxes and $10 M in economic development payments to support Blackford County schools, libraries, roads, first responders, and other essential services.

Prairie Creek will provide clean, reliable energy while delivering lasting economic and social benefits for the region.

Key Points: China's first national standard for automotive solid-state batteries, ""Electric Vehicles—Solid-State Battery—Part 1: Terminology and Classification,"" was released for public comment on December 30, 2025. The standard clearly categorizes batteries into three types: liquid, hybrid liquid-solid, and solid-state, eliminating the term ""semi-solid-state."" It sets a mass loss rate of ≤0.5% as the core criterion for defining solid-state batteries. This move aims to unify industry standards, end conceptual confusion, and marks a step toward standardized industrial development.

On December 30, 2025, the National Automotive Standardization Technical Committee solicited public comments on ""Electric Vehicles—Solid-State Battery—Part 1: Terminology and Classification."" As China's first national standard for automotive solid-state batteries, this initiative is regarded as a key milestone in transitioning this cutting-edge technology from the laboratory to industrial collaboration. It aims to resolve market conceptual ambiguities and lay the foundation for standardized industry development. The concurrent ""Technical Specification for Solid Electrolytes Used in Electric Vehicle Solid-State Batteries"" is currently in the drafting stage.

I. Core of the Standard: Unified Classification and Stringent Technical Thresholds

The draft focuses on establishing a unified technical terminology system and setting clear quantitative criteria for defining ""solid-state batteries.""

Clear Three-Type Classification, Eliminating ""Semi-Solid-State"": Based on the method of ion transport within the cell, the standard categorizes batteries into liquid batteries, hybrid liquid-solid batteries, and solid-state batteries. This means the previously commonly used term ""semi-solid-state battery"" is not included in the national standard system, and related products will be classified as ""hybrid liquid-solid batteries.""

Establishment of Key Criterion: The standard sets a strict core quantitative indicator for defining ""solid-state batteries""—the mass loss rate. It stipulates that the mass loss rate (mass loss of electrolytes and other components under specific test conditions) for solid-state batteries should not exceed 0.5%. This threshold is stricter than the group standard ""All-Solid-State Battery Determination Method"" released in May 2025 (mass loss rate <1%). The basis for this requirement is consideration of potential minor decomposition of solid electrolyte materials, and industry validation tests show that compliant products have mass loss rates below 0.5%.

Multi-Dimensional Classification System: The standard further classifies solid-state batteries along three dimensions:

By Electrolyte Type: Sulphide-, oxide-, polymer-, halide-, and composite electrolyte-based solid-state batteries.

By Conducting Ions: Solid-state lithium-ion batteries, solid-state sodium-ion batteries, etc.

By Application Field: High-energy type, high-power type, etc.

II. Standard System Planning: Building a Comprehensive Industrial Framework

The ""Terminology and Classification"" draft is only the first step in a series of national standards. According to the plan, the ""Electric Vehicles—Solid-State Battery"" series is divided into four parts:

Part 1: Terminology and Classification (current draft)

Part 2: Performance Specifications

Part 3: Safety Specifications

Part 4: Life Specifications

Additionally, the supporting ""Technical Specification for Solid Electrolytes Used in Electric Vehicle Solid-State Batteries"" has entered the drafting stage, indicating that standardization efforts are extending to core materials.

The introduction of standards means the industry now has relatively unified and standardized guidelines for enterprises and practitioners to follow, aiming to end conceptual confusion, unify technical standards, facilitate industry chain collaboration, and seize international rule-making influence.",https://imgqn.smm.cn/news/cmpfN20220406172203.jpg,N,,2025-12-31 10:58:41.426110

We sure needed the extra manpower to cover everything that 2025 brought. President Donald Trump shook up the clean energy landscape as soon as he entered the White House, taking particular aim at offshore wind and EVs. Worries about rising power demand from data centers reached a fever pitch. And startups boasted major breakthroughs in cleaning up manufacturing, decarbonizing home heating, and bringing battery storage to the masses.

That’s just a handful of the many, many topics Canary Media reporters covered this year through more than 600 stories. Here are 11 that you can’t miss, in chronological order.

Jeff St. John started 2025 with a deep dive into what became one of the year’s hottest energy topics: data centers. In this first installment of a four-part series, Jeff explored the growing concern over AI data centers’ capacity to drive power demand to new heights, and how utilities may use that rising demand to justify new fossil fuel construction. But with effective regulation and demand management, it doesn’t have to be that way.

Julian Spector turned his visit to Quaise Energy’s Texas testing grounds into a feast for the senses. Whirring contraptions, hand-warming heat, and the smell of toasted marshmallows: Those are just a few of the ways Julian described the experience of watching the startup blast through rock with an electromagnetic beam. It’s all in hopes of accessing deeper, hotter levels of the Earth for geothermal power generation.

Mayor Mondale Robinson has big clean energy dreams for his small rural town of Enfield, North Carolina, and shared them with Elizabeth Ouzts back in March. Residents of the largely Black, devastatingly poor town face massive winter energy bills, and Robinson envisions tackling them through a solar-plus-storage array that could help stabilize power costs — and a resilience hub that could teach residents about energy savings and keep them safe during emergencies.

In May, Canary Media joined fellow nonprofit newsrooms to report a series of stories on the growing clean energy workforce in rural America. That project took Kari Lydersen to Decatur, Illinois, which has been losing factory jobs for years. But a community college program is training a new generation of solar panel installers to change that dynamic, including Shawn Honorable, who’s planning to start a solar-powered hot dog stand called Buns on the Run.

Since the late 1800s, America’s network of hydroelectric dams has provided a steady, clean source of electricity. But their age is catching up with them, Alexander C. Kaufman reported in this deep dive. Nearly 450 dams across the country will need to be relicensed in the next decade, but many must make significant, costly upgrades to keep operating — and may opt to shut down instead.

The end of 2025 may also signal the end of the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations. Created under the Biden administration, the office was meant to be a federally backed launchpad for ambitious but unproven clean technologies. In a thoughtful obituary for OCED, Maria Gallucci recounts the office’s biggest wins, and how that all started crumbling on Day 1 of the Trump administration.

Cheez Whiz, notepaper, and beer all have one thing in common: They’re made with the help of gas-burning boilers. But if it’s up to AtmosZero, that’ll soon change. Alison F. Takemura took us on a tour of the Colorado factory where AtmosZero will soon start building steam-producing heat pumps, in hopes of decarbonizing all sorts of polluting processes.

Marissa Gillett didn’t make a lot of friends during her time leading Connecticut’s Public Utilities Regulatory Authority. While consumer advocates heralded her assertive oversight, investor-owned utility regulators accused her of inappropriate, and even unlawful, bias. In an interview with Sarah Shemkus after she stepped down from PURA, Gillett didn’t back down from her ​“sustained, rigorous” approach, and called on other regulators to do the same.

Ohio has become a hot spot for anti-clean-energy rules, with more than three dozen counties outlawing utility-scale solar development in at least one of their townships. Richland County is among them, but in the new year, residents may reverse the ban. Kathiann M. Kowalski reports on how a group of local advocates secured a referendum on the decision made by just three county commissioners — and how they could inspire other Ohioans to do the same.

This fall, Dan McCarthy took us on a trip to Greece. Far from Athens and the iconic whitewashed buildings of the Cyclades islands is Western Macedonia, which remains the country’s energy-producing hub even as its coal plants and mines shutter. Solar farms have rapidly taken the fossil fuel’s place, but residents are frustrated that the region’s economy hasn’t kept up.

Our list closes with a story Clare Fieseler started following three years ago, at a time when Republican lawmakers didn’t have much to say about offshore wind. Since then, the industry has become a prime target for the Trump administration, and David Stevenson is a big reason why.

Although both companies will release annual sales figures soon, based on the latest reports, BYD has taken the lead and set a significant lead that makes it seem virtually impossible for Tesla to close the gap.

By the end of November, the Shenzhen-based company—which also makes plug-in hybrid vehicles—had sold more than two million fully electric vehicles, becoming the first company to surpass that figure. Tesla, on the other hand, sold slightly more than 1.2 million electric vehicles by the end of September.

The American manufacturer benefited in the third quarter from a surge related to the expiration of tax credits in the US, which prompted many buyers to rush to make purchases. Global shipments were up 7 percent year-over-year.

Although experts expect an increase in sales for Tesla in the fourth quarter, analysts are forecasting about 1.65 million for the full year of 2025. That would be a drop of about 8 percent compared to last year’s result. Sales were below expectations in North America (-33%), Europe (-34%), and, to a lesser extent, China (-10%). This is also a significantly lower annual forecast than BYD’s sales as of the end of November.

Tesla’s sales have been hit by an unexpected slowdown in the transition to electric vehicles, increased competition and the relationship between Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Donald Trump during the presidential campaign. It tarnished the brand’s image and sparked protests and calls for a boycott. Sales have fallen sharply and continue to fall, especially in Europe.

The funding losses follow a shift in federal priorities in 2025 that froze or terminated dozens of grants tied to solar, energy efficiency, and climate equity programs. At the same time, federal and private capital has continued to flow into select sectors such as nuclear power and grid infrastructure, creating a clear divide between canceled and still-active investments.

Canceled vs. Active Clean-Energy Projects in Michigan

Canceled / Frozen Projects

Active / Moving Forward Projects

What the Split Reveals About Michigan’s Energy Strategy

The table highlights a key shift: projects branded explicitly around climate policy and equity were the most vulnerable, while investments tied to reliability, national security, and industrial capacity have largely survived.

Solar and efficiency programs — particularly those dependent on Environmental Protection Agency grants — suffered the deepest cuts. Michigan’s planned $156 million Solar for All rollout, which would have expanded rooftop and community solar in underserved areas, was halted alongside tribal solar programs and workforce initiatives that had already begun hiring and project planning.

At the manufacturing level, the loss of federal support derailed projects meant to rebuild domestic supply chains for energy-efficient construction and power transmission — including the Detroit-based LuxWall plant and TS Conductor’s high-capacity transmission line factory.

Nuclear and Grid Infrastructure Emerge as Winners

By contrast, nuclear energy has emerged as one of the clearest winners in Michigan’s evolving energy mix.

Federal backing for the Palisades nuclear facility — including a $1.5 billion loan to restart the plant and an additional $400 million commitment tied to new reactor development — underscores a broader national pivot toward always-on, carbon-free power capable of supporting industrial growth, electrification, and data-center demand.

Grid infrastructure projects have also remained active, driven less by climate policy and more by necessity. Rising electricity demand from AI data centers, EV charging, and advanced manufacturing has kept utilities focused on transmission upgrades, even as grant-funded manufacturing components were cut.

Policy Risk Now a Central Factor

The diverging outcomes underscore a new reality for Michigan businesses: federal policy risk is now a decisive factor in project viability.

Projects tied directly to climate equity and renewable deployment proved most exposed to abrupt funding reversals. Meanwhile, investments framed around grid reliability, energy security, and industrial competitiveness retained support.

Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel has joined multistate legal challenges arguing that the grant terminations violate congressional authority. Even so, developers say the uncertainty alone has already altered investment decisions and slowed new announcements.

The Bigger Economic Impact

Michigan entered 2025 with one of the nation’s most ambitious clean-energy pipelines. The loss of $540 million in grants — and roughly $3 billion in related private investment — does not erase that progress, but it reshapes the trajectory.

Workforce pipelines tied to solar and efficiency are now under strain. Communities that planned around grant-funded projects face gaps. Manufacturers are reassessing whether Michigan remains the best location for climate-linked investments.

At the same time, nuclear energy, grid infrastructure, and select industrial projects are becoming the new anchors of Michigan’s energy economy — more politically durable, but narrower in scope.

Michigan’s Clean-Energy Crossroads

Michigan’s challenge heading into 2026 is no longer whether clean energy matters, but which kinds of clean energy can survive shifting federal priorities.

The state now faces a strategic decision: how to rebuild momentum in solar, efficiency, and workforce development while recognizing that future growth may depend more heavily on energy reliability, grid strength, and industrial resilience than on climate branding alone.",https://mitechnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Canceled-vs-active-clean-energy-projects-in-Michigan.jpg,N,,2025-12-31 15:00:03.594844

Our goal is straightforward: ensure that clean water and common sense go hand-in-hand.","For a decade now, farmers and ranchers have been calling for a clear “Waters of the United States” rule that respects our careful stewardship. For many of us, the definition of WOTUS isn’t a distant policy discussion — it’s personal.

The WOTUS rule determines how we manage our land, how we plan conservation work and how we keep our farms running without getting tangled in unclear regulations.

Clean water is essential for every farmer and rancher; we depend on it every day. That’s why we’re encouraged to see the new proposed rule from the Environmental Protection Agency and Army Corps of Engineers.

The proposal protects critical water resources while recognizing the work farmers do to care for the land. It is clear that the agencies are responding to concerns raised by farmers and bringing much-needed clarity to the rule.

Why It Matters

Farmers understand the importance of clean water. Our farms and our families depend on it. We rely on it for our crops, our livestock and our daily lives.

We spend countless hours putting conservation practices in place to protect our water sources and to improve the land we care for.

Clean water is part of every decision we make on the farm, from how we manage our soil to how we rotate our livestock on pastures and protect our streams.

But protecting water starts with clear and workable rules. When definitions stretch too far, ordinary farm activities can fall under burdensome and costly federal oversight.

That can turn routine work into a regulatory guessing game, slowing progress instead of supporting it. A practical WOTUS rule must balance environmental protection with the realities of farming.

Continued Leadership

The latest proposal shows movement toward the clarity farmers have been calling for. It reflects some of the concerns raised over the years and responds to the Supreme Court’s decision in Sackett v. EPA that federal agencies must rein in their regulatory overreach.

Farm Bureau has long called for consistent and fair guidelines surrounding the Clean Water Act. We are reviewing every detail of the new proposal and crafting comments that reflect the real-world challenges farmers and ranchers are facing. Our goal is straightforward: ensure that clean water and common sense go hand-in-hand.

We will continue to share farmers’ stories and remind policymakers that regulatory certainty is essential for long-term stewardship.

When the rules are clear and fair, farmers can keep doing what we do best — caring for the land and producing the food, fiber and renewable fuel American families depend on.",https://www.agrinews-pubs.com/resizer/7Hw8v1AKO1X9cSRkXukbSHXHZRM=/1200x630/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/shawmedia/OGI6ARPEYZBTJDX2WWBCYELCMI.jpg,N,,2025-12-31 10:00:13.935059

PFAS If PFAS felt like regulatory jazz this year, that’s because EPA has played variations on a theme of delay.","If you felt like environmental compliance was a game of regulatory whack-a-mole this year, you’re not alone.

Between Supreme Court rewrites of familiar statutes, a moving target for PFAS obligations, extended methane deadlines, and Indiana’s new stormwater and water-pipeline rules, our regulated community spent 2025 chasing certainty.

What follows is a quick tour of this year’s highlights, and why planning, permitting, and litigation strategies all had to flex.

Clean Water Act

In March, the Supreme Court held that not all “limitations” under the CWA’s effluent-limitations provision must qualify as “effluent” limitations. City & Cnty. of San Francisco, California v. Envtl. Prot. Agency, 604 U.S. 334, 344-346 (2025).

In plain English, our Supreme Court said an agency can’t write a permit that says “thou shalt never contribute to a water quality standard exceedance” and then blame the permittee for everything even upstream, not just what they discharge. This change could be helpful to look at what a permittee can control rather than the ambient condition of shared waters prior to discharge.

Clean Air Act

On June 18, the Court, in a consolidated case, issued two venue rulings that shape how and where EPA actions are litigated. First, for EPA v. Calumet Shreveport Refining, the Court confirmed that certain EPA actions, even if locally applicable, belong in the D.C. Circuit when EPA properly finds and publishes that the action is based on a determination of “nationwide scope or effect.”

The Court put forth a two-step inquiry for determining venue. Envtl. Prot. Agency v. Calumet Shreveport Ref., L.L.C., 605 U.S. 609, 615 (2025). Second, in Oklahoma et al. v. EPA, the Court held that individual State Implementation Plan disapprovals are locally or regionally applicable actions reviewable in regional circuits, even if bundled in an omnibus Federal Register notice. Id., at 620. So, venue fights are now a threshold strategy call, not an afterthought, since some program decisions could be litigated in more than one venue with different odds of success.

National Environmental Protection Act

In May, the Supreme Court unanimously reversed the D.C. Circuit’s demand for expansive “upstream” and “downstream” analysis in the Uinta Basin Railway case. Seven County Infrastructure Coalition v. Eagle County held that NEPA doesn’t force agencies to chase the effects of separate projects, especially those outside their jurisdiction. 605 U.S. 168, 189-191 (2025). It also says that the potential for projects only related in time or use, related through a but-for causal relationship, or that are potentially foreseeable just isn’t enough to demand more analysis.

But the ultimate question here was not whether the Environmental Impact Statement in and of itself was inadequate, but whether appellate review of the reviewing board’s final decision was reasonable. So, while 2024 saw the overturning of Chevron deference, the Court here emphasized the high level of deference due to the NEPA-reviewing agency in judicial review.

Keep in mind that NEPA imposes no substantive constraints on a decision to build, fund, or approve a proposed project. An EIS “is only one input into an agency’s decision and does not itself require any particular substantive outcome,” such that “the adequacy of an EIS is relevant only to the question of whether an agency’s final decision … was reasonably explained.” Id., at 179-80.

PFAS

If PFAS felt like regulatory jazz this year, that’s because EPA has played variations on a theme of delay. The final national primary drinking water regulation (NPDWR) for six PFAS Maximum Contaminant Levels (MCLs) took effect in June 2024, including for PFOA and PFOS. PFAS NPDWR, 89 FR 32,532-01 (Apr. 26, 2024).

But in May 2025, EPA said it would maintain those two but extend compliance deadlines and reconsider determinations for PFHxS, PFNA, and HFPO-DA (GenX), including the Hazard Index approach. Operators (and bond counsel) now are trying to time capital programs to evolving deadlines and constituents. Press Release, U.S. EPA, EPA Announces It Will Keep MCLs for PFOA, PFOS (May 14, 2025)

In May, EPA issued an interim final rule delaying the reporting window for Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) § 8(a)(7) one-time reporting and signaled it might reopen aspects of the 2023 rule. Then in November, EPA proposed certain exemptions along with timeline adjustments.

Many companies that built data systems for a “no-exemptions” world now must decide whether to keep collecting under a broad standard or to pivot to narrower proposed categories, with an eye to future changes and potential litigation. PFAS Data Reporting and Recordkeeping Under (DRRU) the TSCA; Change to Submission Period, 90 FR 20236-01, 90 Fed. Reg. 20,236 (May 13, 2025). PFAS DRRU TSCA; Revision to Regulation, 90 FR 50923-01 (Nov. 13, 2025). The net effect is that TSCA plans that were locked-in for Q1 became revise-as-you-go by Q4.

Oil and gas

For owners/operators under EPA’s New Source Performance Standards 40 C.F.R. pt. 60, subpart OOOOc for new crude oil and natural gas facilities since Dec. 2022, and Emissions Guidelines for existing facilities under subpart OOOOc, EPA first issued an interim final rule in July 2025 extending both the multiple compliance deadlines and the state-plan submittal deadline and also delaying the Super-Emitter Program.

In December, EPA finalized the extension and set certain monitoring/reporting dates. Oil and Natural Gas Sector Climate Review: Extension of Deadlines in Standards of Performance for New, Reconstructed and Modified Sources and Emissions Guidelines for Existing Sources, 90 FR 55671-01 (Dec. 3, 2025). Adjust your calendars accordingly.

Indiana stormwater preemption

Indiana’s new HEA 1037 (Pub. L. 150) says local units may not adopt stormwater laws, rules, ordinances or regulations more stringent than IDEM’s Construction Stormwater General Permit (CSGP), that any such provision is void, and a unit must discharge its duties under the state program.

The May 1 law adding Ind. Code §36-1-3-14 also authorizes warnings and stop-work orders for potential and ongoing violations. Love it or not, designs and enforcement now meet a single statewide baseline instead of having local rule. (Ind. Gen. Assemb., 2025 Reg. Sess., H.B. 1037 (Public Law 150). Make sure you check bid specs and local manuals for anything exceeding a CSGP, including financial assurances, post-construction drainage reports, dust/sediment controls, etc.

Indiana water pipelines

This new law matters for utilities, large economic development and communities wary of interbasin water transfers, such as for the Lebanon LEAP development. The idea here is to make big water moves happen only with statewide eyes on reliability, hydrology and rate impacts.

Indiana’s SEA 4 (Pub. L. 99), effective July 1, 2025, does three big things: defines “long-haul water pipelines” and requires that a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity be issued by the IURC before construction; triggers transfer permits for qualifying interbasin transfers through the Indiana DNR, evaluating hydrologic sustainability and the “public interest;” and adds notice and recovery mechanisms (with some cost recovery) and clarifies agency roles.

The through-line for 2025 is simple: trying to manage uncertainty. For 2026, calendar your deadlines and extensions (and extensions to the extensions), write permits the statute actually authorizes (hopefully), litigate where it counts and when in doubt, add one more footnote.•

Some are struggling to replace lost jobs with new ones. Other folks are gainfully employed but see their real incomes being eroded by the rising costs of housing, health care, transportation, and other necessities.

Washington certainly needs to get its act together. State and local policymakers can also do more to provide the high-quality education and infrastructure needed to compete for tomorrow’s industries. But the primary drivers of a healthy economy are private, not public. And right now, too many of them are constrained, diverted, or blocked by unwise regulation.

These economic frictions — let’s call them choke points — keep existing businesses from growing and hiring, keep new businesses from starting, and keep producers and consumers from realizing the full benefits of competitive markets.

Rigid zoning and permitting delays, for example, continue to deter homebuilders from supplying enough housing stock to meet demand. Occupational licensing makes it unnecessarily expensive and time-consuming for North Carolinians to change careers or launch new enterprises. And outdated state laws limit competition among hospitals and health providers. As a result, North Carolina’s health care costs exceed those of many of our peers.

A recent report by The Charlotte Ledger spotlighted another painful choke point: car and truck prices. For decades, North Carolina law forbade automobile manufacturers from selling their products directly to their customers. Dealers insisted the result wasn’t a system rigged in their favor, since they compete intensely among themselves to sell vehicles and services to consumers.

If this were true, however, there’d be no need for such a law! If independent retailers deliver real value to motorists — a proposition that doesn’t strike me as implausible, actually — they can surely prove their worth in a fully competitive market in which consumers can choose how and from whom to purchase vehicles and services.

In 2019, the General Assembly loosened the automobile choke point, however slightly, by allowing Tesla to open five dealerships in North Carolina. Now that other new companies are entering the hybrid and electric-vehicle space, however, the Tesla exception no longer makes sense (and is vulnerable to legal challenge). Many states — including the likes of Virginia, Tennessee, and Florida — already allow all EV comers to sell directly.

North Carolina ought to join them. Indeed, I’d like to see our state eliminate the choke point entirely by repealing our dealer-franchising laws and allowing manufacturers of all vehicle classes to strike whatever distribution deals they wish. A radical suggestion? Not really. A 2022 poll found that 83% of North Carolinians favored “allowing North Carolina drivers to purchase a vehicle straight from the manufacturer, and to receive routine service and repairs on a vehicle from the manufacturer, without having to go through a dealership.”

A 2024 report for the US Department of Justice projected that eliminating artificial restrictions on car sales wouldn’t just put downward pressure on prices. “Perhaps the most obvious benefit,” wrote Gerald Bodisch, an economist in DOJ’s Antitrust Division, “would be greater customer satisfaction, as auto producers better match production with consumer preferences ranging from basic attributes on standard models to meeting individual specifications for customized cars.”

As for dealer concerns about potential mistreatment, Bodisch concluded that “competition among auto manufacturers gives each manufacturer the incentive to refrain from opportunistic behavior and to work with its dealers to resolve any free-rider problems.”

“Consumers are used to the idea that they get to decide,” argued University of Michigan law professor Dan Crane. “That they get to figure out, ‘Do I prefer to bargain with a dealer on a lot or do I get to buy it directly from the manufacturer?’”

Whether in real estate, labor markets, health care, or consumer products, regulatory power ought to be used to promote transparency, combat fraud, and protect public health and safety.

Analysis Shows Clean Energy Investments Dropped from $4.7 Billion Peak to Stagnation Under Trump Administration, Threatening Over 61,000 Good-Paying Jobs

View a recording of the release webinar here.

APPALACHIA — A new report released this month by ReImagine Appalachia reveals that 67% of the region’s 92,282 projected clean energy jobs — over 61,000 jobs — are now at risk following dramatic policy shifts under the Trump administration. “Tracking the Appalachian Impacts: What’s on the Line as Federal Funding Flatlines” documents how clean energy investments across Pennsylvania, Ohio, West Virginia, and Kentucky have flatlined after historic growth, threatening transformative economic opportunities in Appalachian communities.

The comprehensive analysis tracks quarterly data from 2018 through Q3 2025, examining both federal and private investments across three major categories: energy and industry deployment, clean energy manufacturing, and retail purchases of greenhouse gas-reducing technologies. The report shows that investments, which had tripled from 2021 to 2024, peaking at $4.7 billion in Q3 2024, have now stagnated, with energy and industry expenditures plummeting from $1.27 billion in Q3 2024 to just $445 million by Q3 2025.

The report also covers how Trump administration led changes to funding have impacted local projects, including the industrial efficiency projects at the Cleveland-Cliffs Corporation in Middletown, OH, workforce development programming led by Landforce in Pittsburgh, PA, long term delays to a coal to solar project in Nicholas County, WV, and impacts to the development of a battery manufacturing facility led by Sparkz Inc. in cooperation with the United Mine Workers of America in Taylor County, WV.

“The Inflation Reduction Act and Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act brought unprecedented investment and job creation to communities across our region,” said Diana Polson, report co-author. “We documented $9.85 billion in energy and industry investments, $18.8 billion in clean energy manufacturing, and $22.3 billion in retail purchases of clean technologies since 2022. These were transforming our communities, creating good-paying jobs that don’t require college degrees. Now we’re watching those opportunities slip away as federal funding flatlines.”

Rike Rothenstein, report co-author, added: “The data tells a stark story. Clean energy manufacturing grew from nearly nothing in 2018 to substantial investments by 2023, with 72% going to battery manufacturing and 19% to zero-emissions vehicles. But the momentum has stopped. Federal clean energy investments waned dramatically as President Trump took office for his second term, and the proposed One Big Beautiful Bill Act threatens to dismantle remaining programs entirely. From a canceled furnace upgrade at Cleveland-Cliffs’ steel plant in Middletown, Ohio, to a stalled solar project on former mine land in Nicholas County, WV, our case studies show how these cuts impact our communities.”

“What’s particularly devastating is that the majority of threatened jobs are in construction and manufacturing, exactly the kind of blue-collar work our communities need,” said Dana Kuhnline, report co-author. “These investments were targeting places like Appalachia that have been left behind. The chaotic efforts to dismantle them will have particularly devastating impacts here, raising residential energy prices, sabotaging job creation, and ceding America’s leadership in clean energy to foreign competitors.”

Key findings from the report include:

Clean energy investments dropped from a peak of $4.7 billion in Q3 2024 to $3.8 billion in Q1 2025, with continued flatlining through Q3 2025

Energy and industry expenditures plummeted 65% from their peak, from $1.27 billion to $445 million

67% of projected clean energy jobs in the region (over 61,000 jobs) are now at risk

Federal funding decreased significantly as the Trump administration took office, reversing gains from historic climate legislation

National data from the Federal Reserve corroborates regional trends, showing private construction spending in manufacturing plateaued at $240 billion in mid-2024 after tripling from 2021

The analysis predicts that the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) will raise residential energy prices, sabotage job creation, and cede America’s leadership in clean energy and manufacturing to foreign competitors, with Appalachian communities bearing the brunt of these impacts.

“In less than a year, we have seen the historic growth of the clean energy and manufacturing sectors drop to a flat line,” the report concludes. “Our region was set to create 92,282 jobs because of clean energy investments. Now those opportunities are vanishing before our eyes.”",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Appalachian-clean-energy-projects-canceled-Trump.png,N,,2025-12-31 00:57:24.657646

LITTLETON, Colorado, Dec 30 (Reuters) - For supporters of the energy transition, 2025 had plenty to complain about: the scrapping ‌of ​U.S. clean energy policies, wind droughts in Europe, corporate retreats from wind ‌power generation and a resurgence in coal-fired power output.

Yet there were also developments to celebrate, including record deployment of battery storage systems, historic power generation shares ​from solar farms in dozens of countries, and continued growth in electric vehicle sales in key car markets.

Below are eight charts that capture some of the key milestones and developments impacting global energy transition progress in 2025, as well as key data points ‍to track heading into 2026 and beyond.

CHINA'S GROWING CLEAN CLOUT

China remains ​at the forefront of clean energy generation, and deploys more nuclear, solar, wind and bioenergy power than any other nation.

Clean electricity production is on track to record its seventh consecutive year of strong growth. Over the first 11 months of 2025, ​total clean power output rose ⁠15.4% from a year earlier, Ember data shows.

Clean power sources will generate more than 40% of China's utility-supplied electricity for the first time in 2025, while fossil fuels' share will drop to a record low.

Fossil fuels remain the primary pillar of China's power system, but since 2019 clean power output has grown more than four times faster than fossil-fuel generation.

With Beijing set to keep expanding its solar, wind, nuclear and battery power capacity over the coming decade or so, clean power's share in China's generation mix is likely to keep climbing.

China is also making its mark overseas via record clean-technology exports, which climbed to more than $180 billion over the first 10 ‌months of 2025, according to customs data compiled by Ember.

Battery storage systems have emerged as China's most lucrative clean-tech export, with nearly $66 billion in sales, followed by around $54 billion in EV exports.

Exports of grid ​equipment ‌and heating and cooling units have also hit ‍record highs in 2025, cementing China's role as the ⁠dominant supplier of hardware for the world's electrification push.

U.S. SETBACK

In contrast to China's momentum, U.S. clean energy progress hit reverse in 2025 after federal support for renewables was scrapped under the second administration of U.S. President Donald Trump.

Steep cuts to tax credits for power developers are expected to slash clean energy investments in coming years and leave the U.S. power system heavily dependent on fossil fuels.

Natural gas remains the main source for U.S. electricity, but in 2025, coal-fired plants delivered the biggest jump in output, driven largely by a spike in gas prices that squeezed utility margins.

Coal-fired electricity output from January to November increased 13% from a year earlier, its highest in three years, according to Ember.

Because coal plants emit far more carbon dioxide than gas plants - over 900,000 metric tons of CO2 per terawatt hour versus about 550,000 tons for gas - U.S. power-sector emissions also climbed in 2025.

Total emissions from coal and gas plants reached 1.526 billion metric tons of CO2 from January to November, up 3% ​from the same period in 2024 and the highest since 2021, Ember data shows.

Given that U.S. natural gas prices look set to finish 2025 at roughly 50% above their 2024 average, utilities are likely to lean further on cheaper coal to meet winter demand.

That means even higher power-sector pollution heading into 2026 and beyond.

BATTERY BOOM AND STEALTHY PROGRESS

Even as U.S. utilities burned more coal in 2025, they also rolled out record battery storage capacity to capture surplus solar and wind power for later use.

Total U.S. installed battery storage capacity surpassed 39 gigawatts in 2025, a 43% increase from 2024, according to energy data portal Cleanview.

That surge is reshaping power flows in key electricity networks. Both California and Texas have added enough battery capacity to materially alter their power grid's generation mix during peak demand.

The California Independent System Operator (CAISO), the state's main grid and the country's largest battery adopter, uses batteries to supply around 15% to 18% of electricity during the evening peak demand, according to Grid Status data, reducing the need for gas and other power sources.

In the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), a more recent adopter of battery systems, around 3% of electricity during peak demand was supplied from battery storage systems - a modest share but up from near zero just a year ago.

Solar power systems have also made their mark again in 2025, generating record shares of utility electricity supplies in several countries.

China and the ​U.S. typically dominate discussions about solar capacity, but solar's widespread penetration in recent years now means that developed and emerging economies alike deploy the technology at scale.

At times in 2025, countries such as Bulgaria, Pakistan, Hungary and Poland sourced around 20% or more of their electricity from solar farms, cutting both costs and emissions.

In 2026, solar's generation share will likely set new records in even more countries, helping to keep global energy transition momentum alive even if some major economies, such as the U.S., step back.

Asked for comment on the ruling, Dominion spokesperson Jeremy Slayton said CVOW is essential to meeting customers’ needs.
Dominion Energy provides electricity to 3.6 million homes and businesses in Virginia, North Carolina and South Carolina, and natural gas service to 500,000 customers in South Carolina, according to its website.","A hearing on Dominion Energy’s request to block the Trump administration’s stop-work order on all offshore wind projects will be held in mid-January, a federal judge ruled.

The administration announced on Dec. 22 it was pausing leases and halting work on five major offshore wind projects under construction along the east coast, citing national security concerns identified by the Pentagon. These include complaints that the movement of massive turbine blades and the highly reflective towers that support them can interfere with radar used to locate security threats.

The Richmond-based utility’s Dec. 23 lawsuit seeks to block the order for its $11.2 billion Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind (CVOW) project. It’s the largest of the five affected projects, all of which were expected to enter commercial operation over the next two years.

Dominion estimated CVOW would begin generating electricity in early 2026, with enough energy to power approximately 660,000 residences. In its lawsuit filed, the utility described the administration’s stop-work order as “arbitrary and capricious.”

The utility has already received all federal, state and local approvals necessary for the construction and operation of CVOW, spending approximately $8.9 billion to date, according to the lawsuit. Customers are contributing to these costs.

The lawsuit claims the pause is causing “serious, irreparable harm” to the utility and its customers.

“Our nation is governed by laws, and a stable legal and regulatory environment is essential to allow regulated public utilities … to invest and support our nation’s energy needs and associated jobs,” Dominion argued. “Sudden and baseless withdrawal of regulatory approvals by government officials cannot be reconciled with the predictability needed to support the exceptionally large capital investments required for large-scale energy development projects like CVOW critical to domestic energy security.”

U.S. District Court Judge Jamar Walker was earlier scheduled to hear the case Dec. 29, but granted the administration’s request to delay the hearing until January.

The judge ordered U.S. Department of Justice lawyers to get “classified information” regarding the stop-work order to him by Jan. 9. The hearing will now take place on Jan. 16.

Asked for comment on the ruling, Dominion spokesperson Jeremy Slayton said CVOW is essential to meeting customers’ needs.

“Delaying the project will lead to increased costs for customers and threaten long-term grid reliability,” Slayton said. “Given the project’s critical importance, we have a responsibility to pursue every available avenue to deliver the project as quickly and at the lowest cost possible on behalf of our customers and the stability of the overall grid.”

The White House did not immediately respond to NC Newsline’s request for comment.

Is it really about money?

How come the Nissan Versa and Chevrolet Traverse aren’t bestsellers, then? I started to believe the truth is America wants the best at the cost of the least. Am I correct?

Picture this: the next hot EV on social media has 0‑60 in the mid‑3s, a range north of 300 miles, and a minimalist interior. Critics call it “car‑of‑the‑year material.” But walk into a dealership and the price tag makes your eye twitch — $65,000, $70,000, even six figures once options and destination are added. Suddenly, that dream spec sheet reads like a rich person’s menu. And just like that, people don’t want it. Or at least claim they don’t.

The verdict: they actually do want the car, just not at that price. Snobbery or math? It can go either way and still hit home run.

Cars America Want vs. Cars They Can Afford

In market after market, EVs from traditional Western automakers are still priced well above what most consumers are willing (or able) to pay. According to the International Energy Agency’s 2025 Global EV Outlook, battery electric vehicles (BEVs) in the U.S. are roughly 30% more expensive than equivalent internal combustion cars, and in Germany, the premium sits around 20% or more.

That’s a real number for a real problem: surveys consistently strike through ideology as a major reason auto shoppers hold off on EVs. It’s price. Always price. McKinsey’s consumer mobility survey noted that cost remains the top barrier to adoption, even as range anxiety and charging availability ebb.

So, people don’t hate EVs — they hate expensive EVs.

Enter China: Affordable EVs That Actually Sell

China’s automotive industry flipped the script in Detroit’s face. There, BEVs aren’t a budget premium. In many segments, they’re cheaper than gasoline cars. Let that sink in. And don’t just take our words for it: the IEA reports that close to two‑thirds of battery electric cars sold in China in 2024 were priced below their conventional equivalents, with a median paid price of around $24,000, translating to about $700 less than a typical combustion car.

There’s a market where electrification is an upscale choice, and then there’s one like China where it’s a value proposition.

Chinese consumers responded accordingly. In the first quarter of 2025, EVs accounted for over 40% of total automotive sales in China, including nearly 28% just from pure battery EVs.

And China isn’t just selling domestically. Across emerging markets like Thailand, Mexico, and Brazil, Chinese EVs are often the lowest‑priced option on the lot, helping electric vehicle uptake there grow faster than in many Western countries.

How does China do this? Here’s a few pebbles worth picking:

Vertical integration and battery cost leadership. Chinese firms like CATL supply around 40% of the world’s EV batteries, downstream to both Chinese brands and some Western ones.

Economies of scale and fierce domestic competition, which push prices relentlessly down.

Light EV segments thrive. Smaller city EVs (like the former Wuling Mini and BYD’s Dolphin) are priced under $16,000 in China, illustrating just how far budget EVs can go.

In Europe and the U.S., the picture looks dramatically different: very few EVs retail below $30,000; most sit firmly in the $40k–$60k bracket or higher, squeezed between battery costs, regulatory demands, dealer networks, and old‑school development budgets.

The Western Dilemma

Western brands face an existential question: are you in the car‑selling business, or the margin‑maximizing business? Until recently, the answer was both. Premium pricing boosted profitability, bolstered by a luxury brand halo and expensive SUVs. But what if that strategy is now limiting real market share?

That’s exactly what’s starting to happen. Chinese brands like BYD, Leapmotor, and others are rapidly expanding global reach, even planning factories in Spain and partnerships with legacy players like Stellantis — exactly because they get price‑value for customers.

Fact: people ‘love’ cars they can afford, with performance and features that match or beat expectations. If Western automakers want to win big, the narrative needs to shift:

Join us in shaping the future of Caribbean energy.","U.S. LNG exports have surged through 2025, with Latin America and the Caribbean emerging as major beneficiaries. Annual export data show shipments to the region climbed roughly 40% in 2024, led by Brazil at more than 110 billion cubic feet, while the Dominican Republic ranked among the top island importers. That momentum has carried into 2025, as utilities, power producers and governments increasingly rely on U.S. gas to stabilize grids, replace expensive fuel oil and support renewable integration. For Caribbean and Latin American markets – many grappling with high power costs and aging infrastructure – this flexible U.S. supply is reshaping investment timelines and opening new project opportunities.

At the same time, the U.S. surpassed the 10-million-ton mark in monthly LNG exports in late 2025 – a milestone reshaping energy planning across the Atlantic Basin. Much of the incremental supply is flowing into Caribbean and South American import terminals, where new regasification facilities, floating storage units, and gas-to-power plants are moving from proposal to bankable project pipelines. This shift is accelerating decision-making among utilities and independent power producers and highlighting where private capital can deploy effectively.

Concrete investment activity is confirming the trend. New Fortress Energy – a U.S.-based integrated LNG infrastructure developer – has executed a three-year charter agreement for the Energos Freeze floating storage and regasification unit (FSRU) in the Dominican Republic, scheduled to begin operations in September 2025. This FSRU will provide crucial regasification services to support power generation and industrial demand, demonstrating the near-term utility of floating solutions where onshore facilities are limited.

Meanwhile, in Puerto Rico, New Fortress has reached a landmark long-term gas supply agreement with government authorities that would deliver up to 75 trillion BTU annually of LNG for seven years under contract terms currently under review by regulators. That volume can supply multiple power plants and accelerate plans to reduce dependency on heavier fuels, providing cleaner, more affordable energy for the island’s grid.

These developments demonstrate how import infrastructure – whether floating, modular or land-based – is unlocking private capital interest by creating anchor demand for gas volumes that otherwise would not materialize. For investors and developers, knowing where capacity is being contracted and where offtake certainty is improving is critical to underwriting projects.

Future infrastructure opportunities stretch beyond regasification capacity alone. As U.S. LNG exports sustain elevated levels, there is room for new storage hubs, pipeline extensions and gas-to-power facilities that can capitalize on contracted supply. Global LNG trade patterns suggest that diversified sources of supply provide resilience in volatile markets, and recent export growth trends point to sustained demand in the Western Hemisphere. For example, in February 2025 U.S. LNG deliveries to the region more than doubled compared with the previous month and included cargoes to Brazil, the Dominican Republic, Panama and Colombia, illustrating dynamic short-term flows that can be optimized by flexible infrastructure deployment.

This context will be a key thread at CEW 2026, where sessions focused on gas monetization, LNG hubs and midstream investment provide a forum for U.S. capital – including sponsors, infrastructure funds and energy transition investors – to engage directly with regional governments and Caribbean enterprises. Government delegations from across the Caribbean, alongside U.S. project financiers and LNG developers, will examine where partnerships can move most quickly from MoUs to final investment decisions. CEW’s agenda is designed to help stakeholders assess project bankability, understand regulatory environments and identify risk mitigation mechanisms that can catalyze funding for gas infrastructure.

With LNG export volumes rising, import capacity expanding and long-term offtake deals taking shape, the Caribbean and its neighbors are entering a new phase of energy infrastructure development. Aligning capital, policy and project pipelines at forums like CEW will be critical to turning these trends into investible opportunities that deliver both economic growth and energy security across the region.

Water is limited in the Atacama Desert, and lithium extraction requires a great deal of water.","The Salar de Atacama, a vast desert lake in northern Chile, glitters with a white surface crust of salt under the Earth’s greatest glare of sunlight. Beneath it is lithium, “white gold.” With approximately 7.5 million metric tons of lithium hidden below its flats, it offers an opportunity to fuel an expanding electric age.

Lithium plays a key role in the clean energy future while straining scarce water resources

Desert lakes such as the Salar de Atacama don’t just represent barren salt flats. The brine trapped below the desert surface serves as a reservoir for concentrated lithium. Mining companies pump it from below the surface, evaporate it into ponds, and are left with lithium. Because of its extremely low precipitation and high evaporation, this is an effective and economical way to extract lithium.

However, this extraction comes at a price. Extracting lithium-rich brine requires vast amounts of water in one of the driest places on the planet, putting pressure on local ecosystems and Indigenous communities who depend on those scarce resources. Making the lithium industry sustainable and just remains an urgent challenge for Chile and the world.

Recent studies indicate that Chile’s salt flats contain approximately 28.3 million tons of lithium, with 7.5 million tons located in the Salar de Atacama. This vast resource has the potential to provide a large share of the lithium required for future electric vehicles, power wall batteries, and grid batteries, making the desert lake a key player in the global clean-energy transition.

Why this lithium buried deep in America’s heart matters for the electric era

Lithium is at the heart of battery technology used in electric vehicles, renewable energy storage, and portable electronics. As the world speeds towards decarbonization, global demand for lithium is soaring. Chile’s vast lithium reserves under the Atacama Desert lake place it in an important position in this transition.

Due to the area’s geography and climate, lithium extraction in the Salar de Atacama is relatively inexpensive compared to a lot of other places. The cost advantage has contributed to Chile being one of the main players globally in the lithium market, as this lithium-rich state could power the world for centuries.

Navigating the tensions between nature and human needs

However, this “white gold” isn’t free. Water is limited in the Atacama Desert, and lithium extraction requires a great deal of water. Pumping brine for extraction is competing for the limited groundwater in the area that local people rely on. This is raising significant concerns: wetlands and springs are stressed, and ecosystems, including their wildlife, such as flamingos, are at risk.

This dispute isn’t only environmental but also social. Indigenous people and small towns in the Atacama are worried that mining will drain the water that they depend on and damage their ancestral lands. Opponents argue that with the rush for lithium to feed the global green market, local communities will pay the price.

How using the sun to produce lithium can save energy, yet requires long-term planning

In addition, the mining companies claim that lithium from these desert lakes is comparatively ‘green’ to produce due to the fact that it relies on solar evaporation (thanks to the Atacama’s intense sun), which takes advantage of low energy demand as compared to more industrial mining efforts. Delivering on reduced environmental risks will require considered long-lead-time response planning.",https://www.eldiario24.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/1001451430-2.jpg,N,,2025-12-30 20:58:28.502999

Technical and Policy Hurdles Facing Dynamic Charging Yet despite the momentum, there are formidable barriers.
If trucks are in the mix, freight operators will weigh whether dynamic charging shrinks battery requirements, boosts payload or enhances route economics.","Florida is advancing a highway segment that would let electric vehicles charge as they drive, the first such system to emerge in the U.S. and one that could upend transportation if officials are able to track its success. The Central Florida Expressway Authority will get started on the work in 2026 to construct the 3/4-mile inductive charging lane within State Road 516, and open the route up to motorists by 2029.

How the Wireless EV Charging Highway Works

Coils under the road will generate a magnetic field. Vehicles outfitted with receiver coils would then pick up that energy and transform it into electricity while driving, a process called dynamic wireless power transfer. Instead of charging that takes place at the curb or on a pad, power is transferred constantly over a section of pavement to avoid having to sit at chargers and potentially meaning smaller onboard batteries down the road.

It is no longer theoretical. Earlier this month Purdue University and the Indiana Department of Transportation tested a system that transferred 190 kilowatts to a semi-truck at 65 mph, power levels that would suffice for even heavy-duty tasks and are well more than what it would take to charge a typical passenger car traveling the highway. The architecture, Purdue researchers declare, is scalable between Class 8 trucks and compact EVs — given vehicles are outfitted with appropriate receivers.

Scope and Timeline in the Central Florida Region

The Florida test operates on the 4.4-mi (7-km) SR 516 Lake/Orange Expressway, which CFX is currently constructing in three sections. The wireless charging lane will cover a 3/4-mile stretch in part of the first section. The road will open to all vehicles after testing is complete, but initially only instrumented “specially equipped” cars will receive power as CFX and its technology suppliers prove out the system’s ability to perform safely and interoperably.

It’s not clear yet whether the pilot would favor trucks or passenger vehicles. Because trucks drive predictable routes and can provide clear total-cost-of-ownership data, many real-world tests have begun with commercial fleets. In France, a live section of highway is wirelessly charging trucks in partnership with Electreon, and Michigan’s Department of Transportation installed a quarter-mile test roadway open to the public in Detroit with the same company.

Why Florida Is Experimenting With Dynamic Charging

According to the U.S. Department of Energy, Florida is one of the fastest-growing EV markets in the country based on total vehicle registrations, second only behind California. But the rush to adopt is meeting some old obstacles: range anxiety on highways, peak-time traffic at fast chargers and grid limitations at popular locations. A highway that overcomes the bottleneck is one where charge is delivered as you drive, directly addressing these bottlenecks by smoothing out energy consumption and by reducing wear on stationary infrastructure.

Dynamic charging also happens to complement future autonomy. Vehicles that can drive themselves to a charge zone don’t need a driver to plug them in, and fleets — whether robotaxis or delivery vans or buses — could benefit from more time on the road. It is no accident that the auto and mobility sectors are looking at wireless charging more extensively; Tesla, for example, has openly discussed potential wireless pathways to power robotaxis in the future—demonstrating the operational benefits of cable-free energy transfer.

Technical and Policy Hurdles Facing Dynamic Charging

Yet despite the momentum, there are formidable barriers. Working coils into pavements requires a new construction technique, waterproofing challenges and planning for periodic repaving. The extreme heat and rain of Florida have added additional guidelines for durability. Utility operators will have to plan grid upgrades and smart controls to handle high draws, especially if more than one vehicle parks in the charging lane at once.

Cost is another swing factor. Industry estimates put the cost of dynamic charging infrastructure in the low millions of dollars per lane-mile, depending on power level and site condition. Policymakers will want to see clear metrics: cost per delivered kilowatt-hour, efficiency over time, maintenance requirements and pavement performance. From the standards perspective, SAE’s J2954 has provided a stepping stone toward light-duty wireless charging, and its cousin, J2954/2, aims to standardize a dynamic system—interoperability in this context is important to minimize vendor lock-in.

Finally, the project would have to reinforce—rather than replace—stationary fast charging. National-level programs like Australia’s National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure project concentrate on DC fast-charging stations on highways. If successful, Florida’s dynamic pilot would layer a new capability on top of that network, clipping peak loads and stretching usable range without compelling more frequent stops.

What Success Will Look Like for Florida’s Pilot

CFX and its partners will be examining whether vehicles do not drop their charge while cruising at highway speeds, whether energy transfer is optimal even during extreme rain events or high temperatures, and how pavement holds up to wear and tear without emitting dangerous substances through repairs that could cost more than standard asphalt.

If trucks are in the mix, freight operators will weigh whether dynamic charging shrinks battery requirements, boosts payload or enhances route economics.

If Florida’s 3/4-mile stretch proves out the model — and is made part of projects in Indiana, Michigan and Europe — it could open the door for longer segments on freight corridors and strategically targeted urban arterials. Now that the state has reliable data on performance, safety and cost, it could help to propel dynamic charging from pilot to playbook, transforming a short stretch of SR 516 into a map for next-generation EV infrastructure.",https://www.findarticles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/featured_edited_1767135845-1024x585.png,N,,2025-12-30 20:58:47.425358

Critics say the cuts disproportionately benefit the wealthy and reduce needed state revenue to keep up with growth, while proponents believe the reduction attracts businesses and keeps the state competitive.

The reduction is part of a multi-year plan, approved by state legislators in 2021, with the tax rate gradually lowering each year through 2027. The rate was at 5.25% in 2021 before falling to 4.99% in 2022. It has continued on a steady decline to reach the new floor of 3.99% by Jan. 1, 2026, with the goal to eventually reach 2.49%.

For a single filer in Wilmington earning $50,000 annually, the new rate results in a savings of approximately $97 per year, or about $2 more per weekly paycheck. For higher-income earners who bring in about $200,000 per year, the rate change translates to about $1,000 saved annually.

Former Senate leader Phil Berger (R-Rockingham) and other Republican legislators backed the plan to reduce tax rates in order to make North Carolina more competitive for businesses and workers, with residents keeping more of their income.

However, the timing of the latest cut has become a point of contention as the state continues to operate on a budget frozen at 2023 spending levels. The Office of State Budget and Management projects slower revenue growth tied in part to the rate cut, with overall collections reduced by roughly $823 million.

In their forecast, state economists cautioned, while revenue collection remains strong in the short term, “growth is expected to slow significantly,” noting the scheduled tax reductions put pressure on the state’s general fund. Although the state maintains healthy reserves, OSBM projects declining growth will limit the legislature’s ability to fund future state employee pay increases or expand services.

Still, the income tax rate has become a stumbling block in the latest budget negotiations, as House and Senate leaders remain divided on whether to pause future cuts.

As reported by WUNC, House Speaker Destin Hall (R-Caldwell) has led a push to redirect a portion of the revenue intended for future tax cuts toward compensation, including a proposed 5% raise for state employees and teachers to address staffing shortages. By contrast, Sen. Berger maintained throughout the 2025 legislative session that honoring the scheduled tax reductions is a non-negotiable commitment to North Carolina’s business community.

Brian Balfour, vice president of research at the John Locke Foundation — a Raleigh-based think tank advocating for free markets and limited government — is in support of maintaining the tax rate cuts. He contends it will help maintain North Carolina’s stable tax environment, a factor cited by CNBC when ranking the state #1 for business for two consecutive years.

More so, Balfour said the state cannot afford to “stand still” while some regional neighbors move to eliminate taxes entirely.

“We have a somewhat unique situation regionally, with Florida and Tennessee having no state personal income tax,” Balfour told Port City Daily. “Georgia legislators this year began discussing a pathway to eliminating their personal income tax.”

By reaching the 3.99% threshold, Balfour believes North Carolina gains a competitive edge over South Carolina, which utilizes progressive tax brackets. Simply put, progressive systems tax higher levels of income at higher rates. In contrast, North Carolina’s flat tax treats every dollar the same, regardless of total income.

For example, a South Carolina resident earning $200,000 annually would pay a rate of 6.5% on a portion of their income, resulting in a tax bill of about $11,000. In North Carolina, the same earner would pay the flat rate on all of their income, resulting in about $8,000.

Essentially, with a 3.99% rate applying equally to all earners, a high-earning professional moving from South to North Carolina could see thousands of dollars in immediate annual savings in their income taxes.

To Balfour’s point, North Carolina may beat out South Carolina for a skilled worker, but for a professional weighing a job offer in Wilmington against one in Nashville, the lack of an income tax acts as a built-in signing bonus.

“If we don’t continue to push forward, we may end up getting passed by other states,” Balfour said, referring to corporations and businesses going elsewhere.

He also pointed to the long-term human impact of the tax reduction, noting in the decade following the 2013 tax cuts — which lowered income tax rates and shifted the state to a flat tax system — North Carolina reduced its poverty rate from 17.9% in 2013 to 12.8% in 2023; it was the fifth fastest rate drop in the nation behind Arizona, who uses progressive income taxes like South Carolina. From Balfour’s perspective, tax relief ultimately provides fuel for job creation and leads to increased consumer spending.

Alexandra Sirota, executive director of the North Carolina Budget & Tax Center, argues the flat rate disproportionately benefits the state’s highest earners while reducing North Carolina’s capacity to fund essential services.

Her analysis highlights the tax cuts enacted since 2018 have been enormous for the state’s highest earners, with the top 1% of North Carolinians — those with average annual incomes approaching $2 million — paying $4.9 billion less in combined state and federal taxes in 2026 than they would have under previous policies. Roughly $2 billion of projected tax savings for the top 1% comes from state tax cuts alone.

To visualize the scale, Sirota points out $4.9 billion is enough to fund the state’s entire annual contribution to the UNC System — which increased in-state tuition this fall — and is nearly enough to fund the state’s share of the Medicaid program, which costs about $5.5 billion annually. While the state expanded Medicaid in 2023 to cover hundreds of thousands of additional residents, Sirota explained the ongoing tax cuts reduce the state’s capacity to sustain its required share of the program as federal support scales back.

“The federal government is stepping away from their historic commitments to programs that help people get the care they need, leaving states scrambling to fill the gaps,” she noted. “For North Carolina, this means rising costs at the same time that state tax cuts slash our public revenue.”

A central argument against the timing of the cuts focuses on the “revenue triggers” — revenue benchmarks that activate the tax cuts. Under state law, tax rates only drop if the state hits specific targets. For the 2026 cut to take effect, annual revenue had to exceed $31.3 billion; it did and is projected to hit $34 billion.

In 2027, it has to reach $32.35 billion for the next cut to go into effect.

Sirota suggests the targets are flawed because they do not account for inflation. As the price of goods and services rose over the last few years due to inflation, the state’s sales tax collections increased accordingly and thus tax rate reductions were activated. The state is collecting well over its tax targets, bringing in roughly $33.5 billion in 2024 and projected to hit $34 billion in 2025.

The National Consumer Price Index — which measures costs of goods and services — has decreased from a peak of 9.2% in 2022 to 2.7% today. Inflation for the southern region of the country, including North Carolina, remains about 2.2%.

According to Sirota, the actual purchasing power of those dollars declined, meaning the revenue collected buys less than it would have in previous years and does less to support state funded services.

“Instead of funding child care, public education, and support for working families that will set future generations up for success, policymakers are focused on giving tax breaks to the wealthy and profitable corporations,” Sirota noted in her analysis.

As the new year begins, state legislators will look to have a completed budget by the June 30, 2026 deadline, with tax policy likely at the center of the debate.

New Bedford Marine Commerce Terminal, the first offshore wind port in the country, and the heavy-lift deepwater port New London State Pier are signs that offshore wind is becoming a key driver of industrial development.
More recently, building trades unions on the East Coast participated in a national “Yes to Wind” week of action.
Trump’s attacks on offshore wind and other unionized clean energy projects have opened up political cleavages that building trades unions could creatively leverage beyond statements of opposition and press conferences.
We should listen to the building trades: offshore wind is both a critical energy source and job creator for the future.","Donald Trump’s obsessive hatred of wind energy has reared its ugly head again. On Monday, December 22, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum announced that all construction on offshore wind projects would be halted due to “national security concerns.” This will affect five offshore wind projects on the East Coast, some of which are already mostly completed. In an X post, Burgum called these projects “expensive, unreliable, heavily subsidized offshore wind farms.”

The move rests on supposed classified claims from the Department of War that these projects interfere with radar systems, but no solid evidence has been presented publicly. Just three days before this announcement, the Army Corps of Engineers had approved continued construction on Vineyard Wind, one of the projects that will now be paused. A few months ago, the Trump administration’s attempt to derail the Revolution Wind project in the name of national security was defeated in the courts. A coalition of anti-offshore-wind groups has been coordinating this offensive and supplying the administration with a slew of draft executive orders to use.

While Trump has gone on the attack, building trades unions have been rallying behind offshore wind development and have already experienced substantial job growth from it. This latest salvo has added to growing tensions between the administration and construction unions.

A statement from North America’s Building Trades Unions (NABTU) said this move “kills thousands of good-paying jobs on projects that were legally permitted, fully vetted, fully funded, and already underway. These aren’t hypothetical jobs. They are real paychecks and billions in investment.”

The International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) also spoke out and called the order “a direct attack on American workers. . . . Offshore wind projects represent thousands of good, union jobs for IBEW members who have spent years training to build and maintain this infrastructure.”

The Laborers’ International Union of North America (LIUNA) highlighted the disruptive nature of these stop-work orders, saying, “LIUNA members plan their life around this work. Pulling the plug now — during the holidays and after years of negotiations and extensive reviews — is reckless and unfair to the men and women who build this country.” They demanded that the administration “let us work — and stop playing politics with our jobs.”

The Potential of Offshore Wind

All five of the paused projects are on the East Coast, an ideal location for offshore wind development. The North Atlantic Coast in particular has the best conditions for the industry in the entire country. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory estimates that there is capacity to build 264 gigawatts (GW) of offshore wind that could produce up to 27 percent of the United States’ annual electricity consumption by 2030.

This is why the building trades in New England have been especially proactive and supportive of the industry. Back in October 2023, these unions pushed a unique multistate procurement agreement for offshore wind that was signed by Rhode Island, Connecticut, and Massachusetts. This procurement was meant to help coordinate its development across the region and reduce costs in implementation. Unions worked with the Climate Jobs National Resource Center to craft a vision for building out the entire domestic supply chain including components, specialized ships, and transmission networks.

In October, Rhode Island AFL-CIO president Patrick Crowley announced that building trades unions in Rhode Island and Massachusetts signed a labor peace agreement with SouthCoast Wind to ensure union work on a massive 2.4 GW offshore wind project they have planned.

States throughout southern New England have already begun making substantial investments in port infrastructure directly tied to offshore wind development. New Bedford Marine Commerce Terminal, the first offshore wind port in the country, and the heavy-lift deepwater port New London State Pier are signs that offshore wind is becoming a key driver of industrial development. Rhode Island’s Block Island Wind Farm has increased the demand for skilled workers at the Port of Providence and Quonset. This represents some of the few real examples of successful reindustrialization in the last decade.

More recently, building trades unions on the East Coast participated in a national “Yes to Wind” week of action. In Baltimore, IBEW Local 24 hosted a press conference at their union hall. The local’s political director, Rico Albacarys, says, “Offshore wind is a big deal for us locally.” Earlier this year, the local had the largest class for its training facility on record, and they see offshore wind as a prime growth sector for the future. Energy developer US Wind had plans to build a huge offshore wind hub off Maryland’s Eastern Shore that could power about 700,000 homes.

United Steelworkers union (USW) members would also get work retrofitting the Bethlehem Steel plant, once the largest steel production facility in the world. Jim Strong, a USW “offshore wind sector assistant,” spoke of the symbolic meaning of having workers back at the plant: “We had history and now we have a future with the return of steel workers here. So, this is a big deal for our union.”

But in August, the Trump administration pulled the $47 million federal grant for the US Wind project and is trying to revoke the federal permits. Now it lies in limbo as the dispute works its way through the courts.

In Maine, Iron Workers Local 7 member Chad Ward stressed the potential for local job creation:

A job in the offshore wind industry in Maine would mean I could see my kids grow up, and my kids could have the option of going into an industry that keeps them employed in Maine while also helping to do something good for the environment.

Trump’s attacks on offshore wind and other unionized clean energy projects have opened up political cleavages that building trades unions could creatively leverage beyond statements of opposition and press conferences. The administration would likely have a difficult time dealing with rowdy demonstrations from sympathetic construction workers and media appearances that give them an opportunity to present a compelling case for why these projects must stay. This is a time to emphasize the contradiction between the president’s pro-blue-collar rhetoric and his policies.

Rapid response in the wake of typhoon Mawar In the face of the extreme weather impacts, we mobilized rapidly to provide short-term emergency power solutions.","Typhoon Mawar struck Guam in the spring of 2023, it brought unprecedented devastation to the island. With wind gusts reaching 165 mph and more than 20 inches of rain falling in just three hours, the storm — equivalent to a Category 4 hurricane — was the strongest to hit Guam since 2002.

The impact was severe: uprooted trees, waist-deep flooding and widespread power outages that crippled both civilian infrastructure and critical U.S. military installations, including Naval Base Guam, Andersen Air Force Base and Marine Corps Base Camp Blaz.

We deployed an advanced echelon (ADVON) to Agana Heights to lead the installation and maintenance of more than 100 generators, ensuring power continuity for essential facilities. At the same time, Naval Facilities Engineering Systems Command (NAVFAC) Pacific engaged our power and energy and mission critical teams to rapidly develop long-term strategies to harden the island’s power systems against future extreme weather events.

Together, our teams carried out critical short-term emergency power response and long-term power system hardening planning in Guam, keeping the island’s communities safe and resilient today and prepared for tomorrow.

Rapid response in the wake of typhoon Mawar

In the face of the extreme weather impacts, we mobilized rapidly to provide short-term emergency power solutions. Under the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ Advanced Contract Initiative for Temporary Emergency Power, we deployed a team that ultimately grew to 109 personnel, starting with six specialists who arrived 36 to 48 hours before landfall. Despite extreme heat, humidity and logistical challenges, including equipment delays and rugged terrain, the team installed 109 generators across the island, completing 69 replacements and scaling operations from three installations per day to ten.

These generators powered hospitals, water pumping stations, shelters, fire stations, warehouses and even postal facilities, restoring essential services to communities and military operations. Generators had to be manually rolled for over a mile through difficult terrain. Yet through disciplined Standard Operating Procedures and adaptive problem-solving, we maintained accountability for personnel and equipment throughout the deployment, completing 90 tasks for generator repairs and replenishments.

While recovery efforts from Mawar were still underway, our power and energy and mission critical groups, with teammates nearby in Hawaii and spread across continental US, were called upon to “harden” the island’s military water, wastewater, waterfront, power and vertical infrastructure against the next major natural disaster. Amidst evolving project deliverables while uncovering the extent of requirements and future needs, we provided trusted advisor services and conducted an island-wide electrical system analysis, rapid planning, stakeholder coordination, project scoping and siting, conceptual design and cost estimating a quick turnaround to secure congressional recovery funding as soon as possible following the crisis.

Our team had only two weeks to organize and mobilize our multidisciplinary response team — including electrical, civil, mechanical and instrumentation and controls (I&C) engineers; air quality experts; site safety and health leads; project coordinators — and several of our subcontractors.

Given the tight time frame and broad scope, our team on Guam developed work plans and budgets on the fly while coordinating travel logistics — working 16+ hour days alongside colleagues in the continental U.S. who provided round-the-clock support, including environmental specialists assisting with GIS and permitting, and coordination teams managing rapidly evolving budget data.",https://www.wsp.com/-/media/project/us/image/from-crisis-response-to-resilient-infrastructure-integrated-power-solutions-for-guam/lin-power-solutions-for-guam.jpg,N,,2025-12-31 10:13:14.647242

Draft Risk Evaluation and Supporting Documents

Draft Risk Evaluation Findings

EPA’s draft risk evaluation preliminarily shows that 1,3-butadiene presents an unreasonable risk of injury to human health for workers and the general population (including fenceline communities) from inhalation exposure. 1,3-Butadiene is associated with health effects such as reduced birthweight pregnancies, blood and immune system disease, and leukemia.

EPA preliminarily determined that 1,3-butadiene presents an unreasonable risk of injury to human health for workers and the general population (including fenceline communities). Workers may be exposed to 1,3-butadiene when making products or otherwise using 1,3-butadiene in the workplace. Activities like non-routine laboratory technician maintenance activities can also expose workers to 1,3-butadiene through inhalation, which significantly contributes to unreasonable risk. 1,3-Butadiene presents unreasonable risk to the general population, including fenceline communities, when 1,3-butadiene is released into the environment and people breathe it in.

The draft risk evaluation preliminarily shows that consumer uses do not significantly contribute to the unreasonable risk presented by 1,3-butadiene because reasonably available evidence suggests that 1,3-butadiene only exists at trace concentrations in consumer products and articles and is not expected to degrade and expose consumers. The draft risk evaluation also preliminarily shows that there is no unreasonable risk of injury to the environment.

Background on 1,3-Butadiene

1,3-Butadiene (CASRN 106-99-0) is a colorless gas with a mild odor similar to gasoline, and it is highly flammable. Information from the 2016 Chemical Data Reporting (CDR) for 1,3-butadiene indicates the reported production volume is between 1 and 5 billion lbs/year (manufacture and import).

Uses of 1,3-Butadiene

In the final scope, EPA identified conditions of use associated with the manufacturing (including importing); processing; distribution in commerce; industrial, commercial and consumer uses; and disposal of 1,3-butadiene, for example:

As an intermediate in the manufacturing of adhesive, synthetic rubber, organic fiber, plastic material and resin, paints and coatings, and other chemical product and preparation manufacturing;

As an intermediate in the manufacturing of petroleum, petrochemical, and solid rocket fuels;

In adhesives and sealants;

In fuels and related products;

As a laboratory chemical;

In automotive care products;

In lubricants and lubricant additives;

In paints and coatings; and

In plastic and rubber products (including rubber tires).

The above listed conditions of use are ways that a person or the environment could be potentially exposed to this chemical. However, when conducting a risk evaluation, EPA also considers the hazards (i.e. health effects or environmental impacts) that could occur from coming in contact with a chemical.

Activities and Opportunities for Public Comment

In December 2024, EPA released the draft risk evaluation for 1,3-butadiene public comment and peer review. In March 2025, EPA released a supplement to the risk evaluation describing a preliminary refinement of cancer risk estimates from exposure to 1,3-butadiene in air from releasing facilities. These refined facility specific risk estimates provide important updated estimates for incorporation into the risk evaluation.

The current comment period is set to close on March 5, 2025. EPA is extending the comment period for an additional 15 days. Comments can be submitted to docket EPA-HQ-OPPT-2024-0425 at regulations.gov until March 20, 2025. In order to give the peer reviewers on the Science Advisory Committee on Chemicals (SACC) time to review any additional comments received, EPA rescheduled the February 4, 2025, virtual preparatory meeting to March 25, 2025, and the February peer review virtual meeting to April 1-4, 2025. View the SACC website for more information on these meetings, including the registration links and information about how to provide oral comments during the meetings.

In August 2020, EPA published a final scope document outlining the hazards, exposures, conditions of use, and the potentially exposed or susceptible subpopulations the agency expects to consider in its risk evaluation. The agency released the draft scope in April 2020 and took public comments on the draft document.

Read the final scope of the risk evaluation for this chemical and EPA’s response to comments on the draft scope.

View the docket for this chemical, EPA-HQ-OPPT-2018-0451 on www.regulations.gov.

As EPA continues to move through the risk evaluation process there will be additional opportunities for public comment, including a public comment period on the draft risk evaluation. In addition to public comment periods, EPA will continue to engage with stakeholders as it refines the risk evaluation and stakeholders should reach out to EPA via the staff contact to engage with EPA.

The good news is that inflation is expected to moderate by the end of 2026, down to 2.6%.
Credit scores: Recent data shows that FICO scores dropped to an average of 715 in 2025, down a couple of points from the previous year.
With household budgets squeezed, credit scores could continue to face pressures in 2026.
Interest rates: The Federal Reserve Board just dropped its baseline interest rate to a range of 3.5-3.75%, which represents a quarter-point cut.","As the new year approaches, think about 2026 like one big game of chess.

In any chess match, you’re not just looking at where the pieces on the board are currently. You are trying to envision where they will be a few moves from now, to help you make better decisions.

The same goes for your finances. If you know what the chessboard is going to look like next year — whether we’re talking about inflation, or credit scores, or interest rates, or housing prices — then you can be more thoughtful about plotting your next move.

“By 2026, the U.S. economy is expected to look more stable and predictable,” says Constantine Tsantes, a planner with VLP Financial Advisors in Vienna, Va. “Overall growth is expected to be steady, not booming. For consumers, that means focusing on stronger credit, planning major borrowing carefully, and taking advantage of a more balanced financial environment.”

To be honest, macroeconomic data tends to make anyone’s eyes glaze over. But the reality is that the data impacts us all at a deeply personal level: what interest we’ll be getting on our savings, how much inflation will be driving up our costs, or whether the housing market is favoring buyers or sellers.

That in mind, Current shares insights about what the economic landscape may look like in 2026.

Inflation: This is a figure that’s top-of-mind for most consumers, since we encounter it frequently at the grocery store. Current inflation projections for 2026’s first quarter are 3.0%, according to the Survey of Professional Forecasters compiled by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. That’s up significantly from the previous estimate of 2.6%, indicating that higher prices are proving pretty stubborn.

The good news is that inflation is expected to moderate by the end of 2026, down to 2.6%. One way to cope with this trend is to ensure that your cash savings are, at the very least, outpacing these inflation numbers. You’ll want to look for a savings account that offers a high-yield, such as 4% APY or above.

Credit scores: Recent data shows that FICO scores dropped to an average of 715 in 2025, down a couple of points from the previous year. That’s the second year in a row of declines, after many years of credit scores ticking up.

One reason for that is student loans, since payments are now being reported again to agencies after years of pandemic-related pauses. With household budgets squeezed, credit scores could continue to face pressures in 2026. In fact, the American consumer is looking pretty “fragile,” according to recent comments from JPMorgan Chase’s head of consumer banking, Marianne Lake.

That’s why it’s so important to bolster your credit record, which will make you more attractive to lenders and open up a universe of more favorable rates on loans. One option is to use a secured credit card, which protects you against falling into debt as you can only spend the amount of money in your account. You’ll want to look for one with low or no minimum deposit requirement and that reports to all three credit bureaus.

Home prices: The good news for buyers is that the housing market is moderating, after many years of big gains that made the American dream seem unaffordable to many. For 2026, Realtor.com is forecasting an average 2.2% increase in home prices; compare that to 2024 and its 4.5% price increase. Many metro areas are actually in outright decline, with more than half of U.S. homes losing value in the last year, according to real estate site Zillow.

Combine that with lower mortgage rates, and homeownership becomes more within reach. Next year’s expectations are for 6.3% average home loans, according to Realtor.com, down from 6.7% in 2024.

A buyer’s best weapons for affordability: A better credit score and a bigger down payment. “Preparing early, by improving credit and reducing debt, will matter more than perfectly timing the market,” says Tsantes.

Interest rates: The Federal Reserve Board just dropped its baseline interest rate to a range of 3.5-3.75%, which represents a quarter-point cut. This move typically trickles into many other areas of the economy, everything from interest being offered on savings accounts to rates being charged on car loans or mortgages.

This is the third cut this year, with the Fed signaling more potential cuts in 2026 and 2027. This downward pressure, as the Fed tries to juice an economy suffering from weakening jobs numbers, suggests that the rates savers have been enjoying won’t continue at lofty levels.

Says Tsantes: “Even as rates decline, high-yield savings and short-term fixed income may remain attractive relative to the past decade.” Indeed, any healthy rates you can lock in now – whether high-yield accounts, or fixed-income returns, or even Certificates of Deposit – will have your future self feeling pretty good about 2026.",https://images.stacker.com/s/720/1280/images/stories/2025/12/23/current-whats-in-store-for-our-money-in-2026.jpg,N,,2025-12-30 20:58:51.128412

File this under A for Another Thing Trump Failed At. US President Donald Trump threw everything he had against the renewable energy movement in 2025, killing off new clean power jobs by the thousands, eviscerating billions in new investments, and needlessly raising electricity costs, to boot. Still, for all the pain Trump has foisted upon ordinary working Americans, he failed to stop wind and solar from dominating new capacity additions this year — and his remaining three years in office promise more of the same.

Renewable Energy Jobs Down …

Wait … whut? How can renewable energy dominate capacity additions over the next three years when thousands of households have lost their work in cleantech fields? After all, the numbers don’t lie. People are hurting all over the country as a result of Trump’s pullback on federal support for wind, solar, and EV-related projects. Surely that means Trump has won the war on renewables.

“Businesses canceled, closed, and scaled back nearly $1.6 billion worth of large-scale factories and clean energy projects in September, bringing the total cost of projects cancelled in the private-sector to over $24 billion in 2025 alone,” the business organization E2 noted in October.

The pullbacks resulted in a job loss of almost 21,000 by September, E2 estimated. The hurt was not confined to Trump’s political enemies, either. E2 calculated that Congressional districts under Republican representation lost 15,000 of those jobs, the consequence of losing $12.4 billion in investments as of September.

Hands down, the highlight of Trump’s war on renewables has been his gleefully malevolent attack on the domestic offshore wind industry, an effort that has upended energy planning across coastal states while costing thousands of construction, manufacturing, and services jobs all around the industry’s 40-state supply chain. Still, offshore wind was an easy target. The industry depends on federal offshore leases under Trump’s control. All he had to do was pull the leases, and, well, maybe it’s not so easy after all.

Earlier this month a federal judge affirmed Trump’s authority to stop issuing new offshore leases, but the same judge also revoked Trump’s ham-handed “suspension” of offshore leases already under permit. Last week, Trump clapped back by issuing an emergency order halting work on 5 offshore wind farms that are way beyond the permit phase and deep into construction. That move also wound up in court again after one of the developers, Dominion Energy, sued to resume work.

A hearing was scheduled for Monday, December 29, but the judge decided to reschedule to January 16 in order to review the classified Defense Department report that purportedly compelled the work to halt. Even if work eventually resumes on all five projects, the damage has been done. Construction delays cost money, and local ratepayers will be left holding the bag for increased costs.

… But Renewable Energy Prevails

Despite the widespread human pain and financial consequences of this year’s abrupt U-turn in federal energy policy, Trump failed to stop the forward momentum of the renewable energy revolution. After all, wind and solar — particularly solar — are now the most economical, accessible, and fastest ways to get more kilowatts into the grid (here’s a recent example). Trump lives in an intentionally fact-free world of his own making, but the sun will keep rising and the wind will keep blowing regardless of his intentions.

Again, the numbers don’t lie. Let’s take a look at the latest news from the SUN DAY Campaign, where Ken Bossong has spent years summarizing data from federal agencies and underscoring the renewable energy highlights (see our SUN DAY Campaign archive here).

SUN DAY’s latest analyses of data from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission can be found in full online under the headline, “Solar Dominates for the 25th Consecutive Month Providing 98% of New U.S. Electrical Generating Capacity in September and >75% Year-to-Date,” (here’s one source), which pretty much sums up the situation.

“Solar has now been the largest source of new generating capacity added each month for 25 months straight: September 2023 – September 2025. During that period, total utility-scale solar capacity grew from 91.82 gigawatts (GW) to 158.43-GW. No other energy source added anything close to that amount of new capacity,” Bossong elaborated.

For all of Trump’s efforts to stamp every last wind turbine into the ground, the domestic wind industry came in second only to solar for new capacity additions. Wind accounted for 11.7 gigawatts during the two-year period, blowing past natural gas, which is the only other domestic energy resource readily available for increase at scale. Gas only registered 4.6 gigawatts during that period.

“Year-to-date (YTD), solar and wind have each added more new capacity than did natural gas,” Bossong emphasizes.

How It Started …

To be clear, the damage done this year will continue to ripple out into lost opportunities and higher electricity rates. Still, Bossong draws attention to the strong showing of renewable energy past 2025 and into 2028, with solar pulling far ahead of the pack.

“FERC reports that net ‘high probability’ net additions of solar between October 2025 and September 2028 total 90,614-MW [90.614 gigawatts] – an amount almost four times the forecast net ‘high probability’ additions for wind (23,093-MW), the second fastest growing resource,” Bossong notes.

In the same forecast period, other so-called clean(er) fuels are far behind. Natural gas racks up less than 7 gigawatts in added capacity, and nuclear registers a lowly 335 megawatts — a pretty poor showing considering that Trump has based his entire energy policy around the existence of a purported national emergency — you know, like the kind that demands an “immediate remedy.”

As for Trump’s pledge to keep the coal fires burning in power plants all over the country, he pledged to do the same thing during his first term in office. That was a colossal failure, one that will continue into his second term. FERC projects that coal will shrink — not expand, shrink — by just over 24 gigawatts by 2028. Oil, which has a much smaller starting footprint, is also poised to shrink another 1.6 gigawatts during that period.

“Taken together, the net new ‘high probability’ net utility-scale capacity additions by all renewable energy sources over the next three years – i.e., the Trump Administration’s remaining time in office – would total 114,239-MW,” Bossong summarizes. “On the other hand, the installed capacity of fossil fuels and nuclear power combined would shrink by 18,596-MW.”

How It Ended …

Against this backdrop, it’s helpful to recall that Trump’s energy “emergency” declaration hit the Federal Register on January 29, 2025, directing federal agencies to facilitate the production of “crude oil, natural gas, lease condensates, natural gas liquids, refined petroleum products, uranium, coal, biofuels, geothermal heat, the kinetic movement of flowing water, and critical minerals” as listed in Section 8 (here’s that link again).

So much for facilitating. Sharp-eyed readers will notice that at least three forms of renewable energy explicitly made the cut — biomass, geothermal, and hydropower — with marine energy also included as an unstated extension of “the kinetic movement of flowing water.” The idea that any of those three can provide an”immediate remedy” for a national energy emergency is laughable, particularly in the case of marine energy, which has barely gotten past the technology demonstration stage. If anyone gets the last laugh, it will be the geothermal industry, which is just beginning — emphasis on beginning — to capitalize on a next-generation R&D effort.

BY JEFF TITTEL

The Mikie Sherrill Transition is unique from having the Inauguration in Newark to having 500 plus people involved in the Transition. What also is unique it's the first transition without an Environmental Transition Committee. My concern the environment has not gotten the attention it deserves, and it needs to be a top priority for the incoming Sherrill Administration. Whatever happens nationally on the environment will happen New Jersey first. We face climate catastrophe, flooding, toxic chemicals, threats to clean air and clean water, and rampant overdevelopment.

We also face a bigger threat: the Trump War on the Environment. His administration rolled back more than 150 environmental rules and cut the EPA budget by 55%. New Jersey DEP gets 25% of its funding from the EPA, so these cuts could be devastating.The loss of EPA help and oversight especially on cleaning up toxics sites and protecting our beaches and water ways .

One of the first priorities must fixing the NJDEP itself. After eight years Gov Christie's roll backs followed Murphy Administration with its cuts and lack of caring about New Jersey’s environment. As a member of congress Mikie Sherrill has a good record on the environment. We are hopeful that the Sherrill Administration will step forward with a real plan and resources to move our environment forward. She will also needs to lead on the environment to deal with our many environmental issues and challenges.

NJDEP now has fewer staff than under Christie—about 400 fewer—and a 15% lower budget. Its backlog of park repairs has grown from $400 million to $720 million, and we are not investing enough in urban parks. They did these cuts while doubling the number of senior managers. The Murphy Administration eliminated the Division of Enforcement, and the Environmental Justice law has more holes than a screen door. We need to rebuild the NJDEP from the ground up.

Murphy appointed a DEP Commissioner who was previously a lawyer and lobbyist for corporate polluters and kept most of Christie’s rollbacks to environmental rules in place. Many Christie appointees remain on the Highlands and Pinelands Commissions. There is a lot to fix—including hiring a new DEP Commissioner with government experience and management skills. This person should not come from the business world. DEP is not a business; it needs to be managed and restored, not run like a corporation.

Mikie Sherrill as a candidate called for cutting red tape and streamlining permits. If we really want the department to be more effective and efficient, the answer is not “cutting red tape”—which is code for rolling back environmental protections. The answer is resources: enough staff to do the job, modern equipment to work efficiently, and a reformed management structure. We need to break down the silos within the agency and develop a holistic approach to natural resources, biodiversity, ecosystems, and permitting. Permitting should move more efficiently by requiring applicants to lessen environmental impacts, provide mitigation, and deliver real public benefit.

We must restore the independent Division of Enforcement and the independent Division of Science. We also need to streamline upper-level management and eliminate unnecessary managers.

The Environment was not big issues l during Sherrill's campaign now not during Transition. This is very troubling. It shows that the environment is not as high on Sherrill’s agenda as it should be . I blame the “Zoom-chair warriors” of the Big Green groups for not making this a bigger issue during the campaign and failing to extract a real environmental agenda during the endorsement process. For example, in 2001 I was able to get candidate McGreevey to commit to Clean Cars, the Highlands Act, and C1 stream protections. That is part of the reason it became a priority then. It does not seem to be happening this time.

But you cannot have affordability without an environmental agenda. The environment doesn’t care about politics—hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, forest fires, chemical spills, refinery explosions, toxic water, and overdevelopment will all force action. New Jersey is among the top states for FEMA payouts and property damage from flooding. We are number two in the nation for building in flood-prone areas. We have some of the worst air quality in the country. Only one of our stream systems meets the Clean Water Act’s highest standards. We are among the top states for temperature rise and number three for sea-level rise.

We need a coastal commission or coordinated planning to manage chronic flooding and adaptation, updated flood and coastal rules, and real decisions on where to retreat, where to elevate, and where to harden. We must end logging and attempts to privatize and industrialize public lands. We need to reform the Division of Fish and Wildlife to actually enhance our habitat ecosystems and wildlife. Most importantly we need to release hundreds of millions of dollars in open space funds to buy farmland and environmentally sensitive lands before they are lost to development.

We Need to have an aggressive legal strategy to fight EPA rollbacks. We can pass laws to restore environmental programs and standards .We should also pass legislation modeled on Oregon’s response to the Trump rollbacks:

Oregon Environmental Protection Act: Adopt Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act federal standards as of January 19, 2017, into state law—ensuring that baseline protections remain even if federal standards are weakened. The law also allows stricter state rules than federal standards.

New Jersey should adopt real climate rules and regulate greenhouse gases to actually reduce emissions. We need to update our rules to lessen climate impacts, and reform toxic cleanup laws to restore DEP oversight over the LSRP program (Licensed Site Remediation Professionals).

We must reduce toxic pollution and chemical use through existing laws. All water treatment facilities should be required to remove carcinogenic chemicals like PFAS—this was first proposed in 2007. We should update solid and hazardous waste rules to reduce pollution and increase recycling. Update Highlands and Pinelands rules to better protect ecosystems and address climate impacts. Appoint new commissioners who support their missions and properly fund them.

Make polluters pay for pollution and climate impacts. Fix the Environmental Justice rules so they actually reduce pollution and protect overburdened communities. Limit and stop overdevelopment of our last remaining forests and farmland, using a strategy that protects habitat, watersheds, and enforces a real state plan. We need to regulate warehouses and data center development.

Donald Trump’s policies are an existential threat to our environment. His actions would have devastating effects on New Jersey, because we are the state most vulnerable to climate disruption, flooding, and overdevelopment. We must stand up to Trump, but we must also modernize and fund our own environmental governance.

Affordability means clean air, clean water, open space, and cleaning up toxic sites. Our economy is dependent on a healthy environment our top 3 industries depend on it; Tourism, Food Processing and Pharmaceutical/ Petrochemical. Plus it's important for quality of life and public health. The Governor needs to lead on the environment and it must be a top priority for the Sherrill Administration. Our State Future is dependent on it .",https://www.insidernj.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/bobsmith-1024x768.jpg,N,,2025-12-30 16:58:37.459835

The project represents a up to $10 billion investment in Phase I, including Hut 8’s investment in data center infrastructure.

At the peak of construction on Phase I, Hut 8 anticipates approximately 1,000 construction workers on-site. Once operational, Phase I of the River Bend campus is expected to create at least 75 direct new jobs with employment expected to expand significantly as future phases of the campus are developed. Louisiana Economic Development (LED) estimates the project will result in an additional 193 indirect new jobs, for a total of 268 potential new job opportunities in the Capital Region.

“River Bend is a testament to the power of partnership,” said Hut 8 CEO Asher Genoot. “This project was made possible by the leadership of state and local leaders, the commitment of Entergy, and the determination of the people of Louisiana. Together, we will build infrastructure that supports the world’s most advanced technological applications at scale while setting a standard for how utilities, governments, and innovators can drive lasting economic and technological progress.”

“Louisiana continues to win,” remarked Governor Jeff Landry. “Hut 8’s investment in River Bend builds on our track record of attracting global-scale projects in the industries of the future. As the campus grows, it will further cement Louisiana’s position as a national leader in energy and innovation, creating thousands of jobs and reaffirming our ability to compete and win on the global stage.”

Fluidstack, supported by a financial backstop from Google covering all lease and related pass-through obligations, will be a tenant at the site, which has the potential to scale to up to 1,000 MW of utility capacity, and positions Louisiana as a long-term hub for high-performance computing infrastructure.

Hut 8 tapped Entergy Louisiana to provide an initial 330 megawatts (MW) of utility capacity to support 245 MW of critical IT load for Fluidstack, a leading AI cloud platform for training and inference.

“Energy is one of Louisiana’s greatest competitive advantages,” said Phillip May, President and CEO of Entergy Louisiana. “Our ability to deliver reliable, scalable power while maintaining some of the lowest electricity rates in the country gives companies like Hut 8 the confidence to invest here, fueling economic growth and creating long-term value for our customers and communities.”

The relentless, escalating threat to human health and safety that was once the main driver of clean energy policy?

You’d be forgiven if it’s all a bit hazy, given how swiftly the term was dropped from the energy-transition lexicon this year.

Starting on Inauguration Day, President Donald Trump not only eviscerated climate policy but completely upended the way Americans talk about energy. Though Trump seemed more concerned with taking down ideological rivals than helping constituents' bottom lines, his new lexicon got a boost from consumer concerns about soaring energy prices that had people casting around for quick fixes. Climate change was out. Talk of “energy dominance,” “energy abundance,” and “unleashing American energy” rushed in. The shift was like “6-7” taking over a fourth-grade classroom: inexorable and irresistible.

The new terminology made the scene on Trump’s first day back in the White House, when he signed an executive order with a grab bag of fossil-fuel giveaways under the title “Unleashing American Energy.” A few weeks later, he used another executive order to create the National Energy Dominance Council. Both orders touted the country’s “abundant” resources.

Clean energy advocates quickly began invoking similar terminology in an attempt to shoehorn solar power into the new narrative. The Solar Energy Industries Association even passed out stickers with the phrase “energy dominance” on Capitol Hill as part of its lobbying efforts.

Some media outlets followed suit in deemphasizing climate. In November 2024, five major U.S. newspapers published a total of 524 stories about climate change; in the same month this year, those papers ran just 362 climate change articles, according to researchers at the University of Colorado Boulder — a drop of almost a third. (Both numbers are way down from the October 2021 peak of 1,049 climate articles.)

A number of Democratic politicians embraced the vibe shift in their own ways. “All of the above” crept in among leaders — notably New York Gov. Kathy Hochul and Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey — who wanted to signal they are open to the changing conversation, but not ready to give up on renewables entirely. In New Jersey and Virginia, Democrats Mikie Sherrill and Abigail Spanberger ran successful gubernatorial campaigns with hardly any mention of climate change; likewise, New York City mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani spent little time on the topic.

Most notably, Democrats this year prioritized the issue of energy affordability, an increasingly urgent concern among voters — and one that Trump is belligerently dismissing.

Two liberal groups, Fossil Free Media and Data for Progress, put out a memo in November that endorses this affordability focus, suggesting it’s a way for Democrats to reconcile the new discourse with the old. The memo encourages them to promote the benefits of renewable energy as a cheap source of power in 2026. The headline: “Don’t run from climate — translate it.”

Though Republicans are failing to reckon with the issue of soaring energy costs, there’s still something seductive about their energy rhetoric. It suggests an economy teeming with possibility, held back only by those meanie Democrats with their snowflakey concerns about climate and their insufficient will to dominate. The language implies there are easy answers to at least some of our woes. Worried about soaring energy bills? Unleash the beautiful coal. Concerned about grid reliability? Exploit those abundant energy supplies. Never mind that fossil fuels are most definitely not the cheapest sources of electricity.

The vocab shift, particularly around “dominance,” also captures a vibe that has always appealed to Trump supporters: “That language does have this bravado and machismo that is important to his movement,” Cara Daggett, a professor of political science at Virginia Tech, told a reporter for Grist earlier this year.",https://media.zenfs.com/en/canary_media_articles_453/c7c32d130829547a7008e77c2250673c,N,,2025-12-30 19:12:31.164257

No region does more to fuel the U.S. economy than the Midwest, yet rural communities are so often shortchanged and unrecognized.

However, with the July 4 passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill, Congress and President Trump established a market-based solution. It’s called “45Z” - a tax credit for American fuel production that could bring billions of dollars in private capital to farmers and the rural power grid.

When I say “the grid,” I of course mean more money for new Midwest power plants. But I also mean more money for the linemen - the unsung heroes of the American energy industry.

You might wonder how a tax credit for fuel would be related to linemen or power plants. Fuel production requires electricity. When fuel producers show that they are using clean American energy, such as nuclear, hydro, or solar, they earn a larger 45Z tax credit. The larger the 45Z credit for fuel producers, the more private capital flows into the Midwest grid.

President Trump and Congress created a framework that allows private markets to invest in rural grid infrastructure at a moment when more investment is sorely needed. The 45Z grid capital structure is based on two things: raw electrical power and energy data.

To make a 45Z filing, fuel producers document their production inputs, such as crops and electricity. For electricity, fuel producers enter into special contracts with American power plants. These contracts, called energy attribute certificates, or EACs, contain granular energy data to support a 45Z claim. This data is tracked on a public ledger, similar to how transactions are tracked on blockchain systems.

Because Midwest power plants can generate additional revenue by selling data-backed electricity contracts, and fuel producers want to buy those contracts to increase their tax credit value, these arrangements could result in billions of dollars in new private investment flowing into the rural power grid.",https://www.watfordcitynd.com/image/cache/favicon.png,N,,2025-12-30 16:14:13.902741

The Center for Children and Families offers hope to those who need it most through advocacy, counseling, education, and prevention services. The center began in 1999 as a small CASA program in Monroe, LA. They have since grown into a nationally recognized and respected agency that serves 48 parishes in Norther and South-Central Louisiana, and seven counties in Central Mississippi. The Center has committed more than 59,000 hours of direct service and helped more than 5300 through six programs: Brokers of Hope, CASA, The Children’s Advocacy Center of Northeast Louisiana (CAC), Counseling Services, Medication Management, and Family Support & Youth Transition (FSYT).

“Our golf tournament is a highlight of every year because it’s an opportunity to bring vendors and colleagues together to enjoy themselves while giving back to the community,” said Clay Butler, Drax IT Operations Manager and golf tournament facilitator. “Every year we try to beat the money we raised the year before. When you’re helping local kids, it’s easy to go above and beyond.”

Drax is committed to supporting local communities through the Drax Community Fund and the Drax Foundation, including efforts that provide education and skills focused on improving green spaces, sustainable forestry management and helping the underserved population in Louisiana, Mississippi, Arkansas and Alabama.

“When industry invests in local advocacy organizations, it’s not just supporting a cause, it’s strengthening the community’s voice,” said Matt White, Executive Vice President of North America Pellet Operations for Drax. “Supporting the Center for Children and Families is one more way our team in Monroe gets to pour back into the community we call home.”

He wants them to testify at a hearing about automobile affordability in the States on January 14. There are a couple of issues with that.

First, it’s happening during the week of the Detroit Auto Show. Maybe more importantly, Cruz invited Tesla’s VP of engineering instead of the brand’s CEO, Elon Musk. Those factors appear to be the main reasons that Ford looks poised to skip the hearing, and GM and Stellantis might follow that lead.

When Cruz announced the hearing and his invitations to Jim Farley, Mary Barra, and Antonio Filosa, it was big news. If they all attend, it’ll be the first time that the CEOs of America’s Big Three automakers all appear before Congress since 2008.

The hearing, officially titled “Pedal to the Policy: The Views of the American Auto Industry on the Upcoming Surface Transportation Reauthorization,” is being framed by Cruz as a referendum on soaring vehicle prices and the regulatory burden facing automakers. Ford is pushing back, though.

Uneven Ground?

According to The Detroit News, Farley has already called the Detroit Auto Show the “Super Bowl week for autos,” and that ethos likely applies just as much to GM and Stellantis. On top of that, council for Farley called out Cruz’s invitation to Tesla’s VP, Lars Moravy, as another reason that Farley might skip it.

Ford laid out its case in a December 12 letter to Senator Cruz, written by Brian Smith of Covington & Burling LLP. The carmaker noted that hiring outside counsel for a congressional hearing is routine, but the letter took issue with how the invite list was structured.

Ford Challenges Uneven Representation

“We greatly appreciate the constructive dialogue we have had with you and your staff regarding this hearing, including Mr. Farley’s recent conversation with you adjacent to the White House event on fuel economy standards. Ford remains committed to working with you and your colleagues in a cooperative manner, including in a potential hearing before the Committee,” Smith wrote.

While the letter didn’t mention Tesla by name, it directly criticized what Ford sees as inconsistent treatment.

“Ford believes that it is essential that any potential hearing adhere to Congress’s longstanding tradition of ensuring comparable treatment for similarly situated companies,” Smith added. “If a vice president of engineering is appropriate for the planned hearing, the other companies should have the opportunity to offer a similar witness.”

GM Waits, Stellantis Watches, Cruz Stands Firm

Apparently, GM is on roughly the same page, confirming that Mary Barra will attend only if the other Detroit CEOs do the same. Stellantis has declined to say whether Filosa will appear. Cruz, for his part, appears unmoved. A spokesperson for the senator said plans for the hearing remain unchanged and that all four executives are still expected to attend.",https://www.carscoops.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/wergerg-copy.jpg,N,,2025-12-30 16:58:44.685771

December 30, 2025 - WASHINGTON – On Monday, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency released the following:

On Christmas Eve, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Lee Zeldin published an op-ed in The Hill highlighting the agency’s role in helping to curb food waste across the country during this holiday season and beyond. With nearly one-third of all food in the United States being discarded every year, EPA has launched the Feed It Onward initiative to connect surplus food with people and organizations that make use of it and reduce its chances of being discarded in landfills. EPA’s efforts in redirecting food waste increases access to healthy meals for families, allows farmers and businesses to find new value in products, and allows communities to strengthen the systems that help keep America fed.

Read what Administrator Zeldin had to say:

“As Americans gather throughout the holiday season, we are surrounded by the traditions that bring families and communities together. Across the country, tables are full, neighborhoods are active, and people are taking time to connect with those who matter most. This season of sharing also reminds us of a simple truth: Good, nutritious food should be consumed, not wasted.

“More than one-third of all food in the U.S. is discarded each year. We can do better, and we are doing better. When surplus food is reduced, redirected, or repurposed, families gain access to healthy meals, farmers and businesses find new value in products that might otherwise go unused, and communities strengthen the systems that help keep America fed. Leaning into food waste reduction is a common sense, critical effort that will help make America healthy again.

“Throughout my travels to all fifty states this year, I have seen how local leadership is driving this progress. Communities are finding practical ways to make better use of the food moving throughout their supply chains. When people coordinate, share ideas, and build on each other’s strengths, families thrive, businesses benefit, and the entire system becomes stronger.

“The vision behind the EPA’s Feed It Onward initiative is straightforward: to share the stories of individuals and organizations across the nation who are addressing food waste. The initiative aims to connect surplus food with people and organizations that can make use of it. Good food should not be discarded in landfills when it can serve a meaningful purpose.

“Kansas City offers a compelling example of what is possible, which I witnessed firsthand when I visited Kanbe’s Markets there and met with the team from Pete’s Garden and KC Can Compost. I left encouraged by how local leaders are building real, community-driven solutions that work.

“Kanbe’s has created a model that moves good-to-eat produce into neighborhood stores that traditional distribution often overlooks. Their work strengthens small retailers, fills access gaps, and ensures that families can purchase fresh fruits and vegetables that might otherwise be thrown away.

“Pete’s Garden repackages surplus meals from restaurants and caterers into take-home dinners for families. KC Can Compost broadens composting access for homes and businesses. Together, these groups have diverted millions of pounds of food from landfills — feeding families, supporting farmers, and enriching soil. It is a full-circle model and a clear example of what communities can accomplish when they coordinate and share resources.

“This summer, I visited Scott Air Force Base in Southern Illinois for the launch of EPA’s first Feed It Onward Partnership. Working with Frey Farms, we redirected produce that would have been thrown away just for being labeled ‘imperfect.’ Rather than end up in a landfill, truckloads of fresh watermelons, corn, and pumpkins went straight to military families. This is a clear example of the difference that Feed It Onward aims to make.

“Big venues around the country are also working hard to reduce food waste. During my visit to Talladega Superspeedway in Alabama, I participated in efforts between NASCAR, Denali Water, and Levy to cut food waste at the track.

“I also toured the Kia Center, home to the Orlando Magic, whose arena managers have partnered with Levy to redirect surplus food to local organizations. Even in fast-paced and high-volume environments, effective planning can turn surplus food into valuable resources for the community.

“This issue is gaining global attention. At the G7 Energy and Environment Ministers’ Meeting in Toronto, I spoke with counterparts from around the world and the idea struck a chord, as many shared that they want to learn from the U.S. in this regard, to tackle this challenge in their own countries.

“As the U.S. prepares for the 2026 FIFA World Cup and 2028 Olympic Games, there’s an opportunity to showcase our nation’s efforts in reducing food waste.

The administration announced on Dec. 22 it was pausing leases and halting work on five major offshore wind projects under construction along the east coast, citing national security concerns identified by the Pentagon. These include complaints that the movement of massive turbine blades and the highly reflective towers that support them can interfere with radar used to locate security threats.

The Richmond-based utility’s Dec. 23 lawsuit seeks to block the order for its $11.2 billion Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind (CVOW) project. It’s the largest of the five affected projects, all of which were expected to enter commercial operation over the next two years.

Dominion estimated CVOW would begin generating electricity in early 2026, with enough energy to power approximately 660,000 residences. In its lawsuit filed, the utility described the administration’s stop-work order as “arbitrary and capricious.”

The utility has already received all federal, state and local approvals necessary for the construction and operation of CVOW, spending approximately $8.9 billion to date, according to the lawsuit. Customers are contributing to these costs.

The lawsuit claims the pause is causing “serious, irreparable harm” to the utility and its customers.

“Our nation is governed by laws, and a stable legal and regulatory environment is essential to allow regulated public utilities … to invest and support our nation’s energy needs and associated jobs,” Dominion argued. “Sudden and baseless withdrawal of regulatory approvals by government officials cannot be reconciled with the predictability needed to support the exceptionally large capital investments required for large-scale energy development projects like CVOW critical to domestic energy security.”

U.S. District Court Judge Jamar Walker was earlier scheduled to hear the case Dec. 29, but granted the administration’s request to delay the hearing until January.

The judge ordered U.S. Department of Justice lawyers to get “classified information” regarding the stop-work order to him by Jan. 9. The hearing will now take place on Jan. 16.

Asked for comment on the ruling, Dominion spokesperson Jeremy Slayton said CVOW is essential to meeting customers’ needs.

“Delaying the project will lead to increased costs for customers and threaten long-term grid reliability,” Slayton said. “Given the project’s critical importance, we have a responsibility to pursue every available avenue to deliver the project as quickly and at the lowest cost possible on behalf of our customers and the stability of the overall grid.”

What’s Slowing Down Solar Deployment in Europe and How to Fix It

Lisandra Perez | Hive Module

Abstract

Europe’s solar sector is facing an unexpected slowdown. Despite record installations and low-cost technology, annual solar growth in Europe plunged from 53% in 2023 to just 4% in 2024. The issue is not technology, it is the system around it.

This paper analyzes this slowdown through a dual lens: first, the well-researched systemic barriers of market design, grid limitations, and policy friction; second, the critically under-examined operational and delivery bottlenecks within the industry's project execution model.

Drawing on academic research, industry reports, and real-world field experience, this article argues that Europe’s solar progress is stalled because policy reforms and project execution practices are evolving out of sync. The solution requires addressing both.

This analysis incorporates insights derived from professional experience in European solar project delivery. These operational perspectives are presented as informed industry analysis to contextualize the systemic challenges identified in the published literature.

1.Introduction: Europe’s Solar Slowdown: A Paradox in the Middle of a Boom

Europe finds itself in a solar energy paradox. On one hand, solar photovoltaic (PV) technology has achieved unprecedented competitiveness, becoming ""among the cheapest options for new electricity generation"" [2], and is central to the EU’s REPowerEU strategy, which targets 700 GW by 2030. However, deployment has slowed significantly. Recent market data shows a 92% decrease in year-on-year growth, and solar’s contribution to electricity demand growth has dropped sharply [1]. This slowdown indicates that challenges have shifted from cost and technology to systemic, institutional, and operational barriers.

2.Layer One: The Documented Systemic Headwinds

Academic and institutional research consistently identifies three primary macro-level barriers stifling solar momentum in Europe.

2.1 Market Design & the Price Cannibalization Trap

Europe’s energy markets were not built for high-renewable penetration. Solar energy floods the grid when the sun shines, causing predictable price drops, and therefore lower revenues for solar itself.

Analysis confirms this creates ""serious financial problems, especially for solar power plants"" [4]. The International Energy Agency (IEA) notes that while market designs are evolving, the revenue stability for new utility-scale solar projects in Europe remains a concern without adequate policy support [5]. This market failure disincentivizes new investment just when it is most needed.

2.2 Grid Congestion and Ageing Infrastructure

The physical infrastructure for transmission is a major bottleneck. Europe’s grid is often ageing and was designed for a centralized, predictable flow of power, not for a decentralized, variable-input system like solar.

The result: long connection queues, curtailment in solar-rich regions, mismatch between where electricity is produced vs. consumed

The European Network of Transmission System Operators (ENTSO-E) highlights that significant grid reinforcement and expansion are prerequisites for achieving national climate goals, with thousands of kilometers of new lines needed to integrate planned renewable capacity [6].

2.3 Administrative & Permitting Delays

Permitting remains one of the slowest, least predictable parts of the entire project lifecycle. Even where EU-wide guidance exists, national processes remain uneven.

A Renewables Grid Initiative study identifies permitting delays as one of the top structural blockers for renewable expansion [8].

3. Layer Two: The Overlooked Problem, How Projects Are Built

Even when market and policy conditions are supportive, many projects still get stuck because the project delivery model is broken. Industry experience reveals a delivery model in crisis.

3.1 The Fragmentation Trap and Decision Paralysis

The prevailing industry model relies on long chains of specialized subcontractors. This fragmentation leads to misaligned incentives, communication breakdowns, and a critical absence of unified accountability. When challenges arise, be they technical, logistical, or regulatory, the lack of embedded, on-site decision-making authority causes paralysis. Each layer of subcontracting adds a point of potential failure, slowing progress and inflating costs.

3.2 The Skilled Labor Deficit and the BESS Bottleneck

The solar sector suffers from a chronic shortage of a trained, cohesive workforce. The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) reports that while global renewable energy jobs are growing, skill gaps and inadequate training programs persist, potentially constraining growth [9].

The BESS bottleneck is a prime example. It is not solely a supply chain issue but an integration competency gap. Deploying a functional solar-plus-storage system requires seamless synergy between civil, electrical, and software engineering, a synergy nearly impossible to achieve with disparate subcontractors and a workforce lacking specific cross-disciplinary training [3, 9].

3.3 The Vertical Integration Antidote: A Case in Point

In response to this, a contrasting model has emerged from industry practice: the vertically integrated, compact team. This approach internalizes the end-to-end workflow, from planning and procurement to construction and commissioning, within a single accountable entity.

From direct site experience, even high-performing EPCs struggle when project delivery depends on disconnected subcontractors. A unified, cross-trained team can reduce delays dramatically

4. Fixing the Slowdown Requires a Two-Front Strategy

Europe must address policy barriers and execution barriers at the same time.

4.1 Macro-Level: Policy and Market Reformation

Market Reform: Transition from energy-only to capacity and flexibility markets. This would provide revenue streams for solar paired with storage, valuing its ability to deliver power on demand and support grid stability [5].

Grid Acceleration: Coordinated investment in grid digitalization, reinforcement, and smart grid technologies, as outlined in network development plans [6].

Permitting Standardization: Enforce and digitize permitting across the EU, implementing ""positive silence"" and designating pre-approved ""Renewables Acceleration Areas"" to slash development timelines, applying best-practice guidance available [8].

4.2 Micro-Level Fixes (Delivery & Workforce)

The industry needs a shift toward:

Vertically integrated delivery teams: Most European solar projects still rely on long subcontracting chains: one company for piling, another for mechanical work, another for electrical installation, and another for commissioning.

Every layer adds delays, miscommunication, and diluted accountability. A vertically integrated team replaces this fragmentation with a single unified structure that handles the full A-Z workflow.

Cross-trained workforces: Europe doesn’t just face a worker shortage; it faces a shortage of workers with the right blend of skills. Modern projects demand teams who understand electrical installation, mechanical structures, BESS integration, and grid requirements, not just one part of the process.

Strong on-site decision-making: Workers wait for subcontractor approvals, subcontractors wait for managers, managers wait for clients, and the project stalls.

Empowered, competent on-site leadership solves this.

When site managers and team leads are trained and authorized to make real-time decisions, projects move faster, adapt better, and avoid unnecessary standstills.

Direct accountability for project outcomes:With fragmented delivery, responsibility gets blurred. When something goes wrong, everyone points elsewhere, delaying fixes and eroding trust with investors and developers. Direct accountability means one team owning the full project outcome, one internal standard for quality and safety, one decision chain, one responsible entity clients can rely on. This eliminates the “not my task” culture and creates projects that are more predictable, safer, and ultimately more profitable.

This model directly targets the operational failures slowing projects today. Hive Module’s operational approach (compact, integrated electrical and construction teams) is increasingly aligned with what the industry now requires for consistent on-time deployment.

5. Conclusion: Building the Bridge with New Tools and New Teams

The next phase of the transition is more complex, requiring the integration of solar into a resilient, flexible, and intelligent energy system. The analysis reveals that this cannot be achieved by merely tweaking the same old approaches.

The systemic barriers of market design, grid limits, and permitting are very real. However, their negative impact is powerfully amplified by an industry plagued by operational fragmentation and skill shortages. Therefore, the pathway to fixing Europe's solar deployment is necessarily dual. It requires bold policy reforms to correct market signals and modernize infrastructure, coupled with a ground-level revolution in how projects are delivered.

The move toward vertically integrated, expert-led project teams is not a mere niche trend but a necessary evolution. It represents the operational counterpart to the macro-level policy shift, providing the capable, agile, and accountable execution engine required to build the system Europe needs. By simultaneously reforming the rules of the game and elevating the quality of the players, Europe can transform its solar paradox into a story of renewed momentum and secure, clean energy leadership.

“This 50 by 50, that’s a needle mover,” Morrisey said during an end-of-the-year press conference last Monday.

The comprehensive energy policy will include 25-year strategic development for each source of energy in West Virginia.
West Virginia is one of 12 states and Washington, D.C., which are part of PJM.","CHARLESTON — Gov. Patrick Morrisey set a goal nearly six months ago for West Virginia to triple its electric-generating capacity, but the comprehensive plan is still in the works with a public comment period now closed.

The West Virginia Office of Energy sought public comment and recommendations as it works on developing a comprehensive energy policy around Morrisey’s 50 by 50 energy initiative. The public comment period opened on Dec. 9 and closed last Friday. According to the office, 71 public comments were submitted by Friday’s deadline.

During speeches in August in White Sulphur Springs and Wheeling, Morrisey unveiled his 50 by 50 initiative aimed at increasing base load electric generating capacity in the state from just under 16 gigawatts to 50 gigawatts by 2050.

“This 50 by 50, that’s a needle mover,” Morrisey said during an end-of-the-year press conference last Monday. “West Virginia needs to be America’s energy state … and to really be a driver of America’s energy renaissance.”

According to the solicitation for public comments, the Office of Energy said Morrisey’s 50 by 50 initiative will be an all-of-the-above energy, focused on traditional fossil fuel sources (coal, natural gas), and include nuclear energy, hydrogen power and renewable energy sources (wind, solar, geothermal, hydroelectric.) The comprehensive energy policy being developed around 50 by 50 will include a transmission plan.

“It will address the need for sufficient electricity transmission lines and natural gas transmission pipelines to support the increase in baseload electricity generation,” according to the Office of Energy’s solicitation for public comment. “It will recommend locations for the placement of natural gas pipelines and electricity transmission lines in locations throughout the state that lack sufficient access and in areas where access to increased supplies of electricity or natural gas will spur manufacturing or other economic development.”

The comprehensive energy policy will include an energy security plan in order to protect against blackouts and other disruptions, and prevent potential threats to the electrical grid, such as cyber-attacks. This plan will include inventories of energy sources in the state and critical infrastructure; developing emergency protocols and coordination plans between local, state and federal agencies; and conducting tabletop exercises and other scenario planning.

The comprehensive energy policy will include 25-year strategic development for each source of energy in West Virginia. These plans will focus on expanding electrical generation, infrastructure expansions, economic development incentives, site development, legislation and rule-making, workforce development, education, financial and tax incentives, safety, environmental mitigation and energy security.

Since October, there have been several natural gas power plant projects announced that would add an additional five gigawatts to what is produced by the state’s power plants, including projects announced by FirstEnergy and a partnership between Kindle Energy, GE Vernova, Blackstone and Wolf Summit Energy.

Morrisey’s 50 by 50 initiative and the comprehensive energy policy being developed by the Office of Energy is focused on making West Virginia the battery of the east coast and making the state more appealing to energy-intensive data center and AI projects.

House Bill 2014, a new law first proposed by Morrisey, is aimed at attracting high-impact industrial businesses and data centers to West Virginia along with microgrids to power the data centers using both fossil fuels and renewable energy generation. The rules governing these new data center and microgrid districts are still awaiting approval from the Legislature, with the Legislative Rule-Making Review Committee slated to review these proposed rules next month.

“We’re going to be leveraging the intersection between energy and technology,” Morrisey said last week. “We’re excited about that and we’re going to keep going. We’re working on finalizing those plans. That’s been a big, big project.”

West Virginia only has one natural gas-fired power plant that provides electricity to retail customers in the PJM market, a regional electric transmission organization that operates a competitive wholesale electricity market in the northeast. West Virginia is one of 12 states and Washington, D.C., which are part of PJM.

The state has nine coal-fired power plants, with coal-fired power accounting for 86 percent of West Virginia’s total electricity net generation. In its public comment filing, the West Virginia Coal Association argued that existing coal-fired power plants should be prioritized as the foundational assets of the state’s power grid to ensure reliability and economic stability.

“West Virginia’s nine existing coal-fired power plants represent ‘premium assets’ in this age of increased power demand and should serve as the fundamental building block of any plan to increase generation within the State of West Virginia,” wrote West Virginia Coal Association President Chris Hamilton.

In its public comments, the West Virginia Chamber of Commerce advocated for a free-market approach that balances environmental stewardship with the practical needs of the state’s business community. The chamber expressed strong support for a diversified power generation strategy that utilizes both traditional fossil fuels and renewable resources to ensure grid reliability.

“The chamber applauds the goal of the plan to develop new generation capacity utilizing a combination of natural gas, nuclear, coal, geothermal, solar and wind,” wrote West Virginia Chamber of Commerce President Steve Roberts. “The resource rich opportunities that West Virginia has need to be harnessed for growth of the state’s economy for the benefit of all its citizens.”

West Virginians for Energy Freedom, a coalition of groups that advocate for electric ratepayers, submitted public comments calling for any comprehensive energy policy to prioritize consumer autonomy and protections that protect ratepayers for bearing the financial costs for expanding electric generation. The group called for allowing ratepayers to purchase power from nearby customers, use of plug-in solar systems and removing caps on net metering solar credit programs.

“Without taking a position on the wisdom of tripling energy capacity in 25 years, we caution that, if West Virginia ratepayers or taxpayers would be required to pay for any of power plants built under this plan, there be guarantees and protections in place to ensure that the plants will be useful and beneficial for West Virginians,” the organization wrote.",,N,,2025-12-31 01:12:21.821913

Unlocking the market potential of electric vehicles in the Philippines: A statistical and neural network approach to customer willingness to purchase electric vehicles.","The long-term viability of the electric vehicle market without sustained governmental support hinges on the industry's capacity to achieve a self-sustaining market equilibrium (Figenbaum et al., 2015). This equilibrium is largely influenced by a confluence of technological advancements, particularly in battery cost reduction and efficiency, and evolving consumer preferences for sustainable transportation options (Camilleri, 2018). Historically, government incentives, including tax credits and rebates, have played a pivotal role in stimulating early EV adoption by mitigating higher upfront costs and encouraging initial market penetration (Ramraj et al., 2023). However, as the EV market matures, reliance on such financial stimuli becomes less sustainable due to increasing numbers of EVs and societal pressure to downsize public spending (Albrahim et al., 2019). The progressive phase-out of policy instruments is crucial once the consumer cost differential between EVs and internal combustion engine alternatives diminishes, thereby ensuring that the market can stand on its own without perpetual subsidies (Karlsson et al., 2016). This transition necessitates a careful calibration of policy wind-downs to prevent market disruptions, as abrupt policy reversals can introduce significant uncertainty for both consumers and industry stakeholders (Bhardwaj et al., 2025). Indeed, the gradual reduction and eventual elimination of incentives should align with declining battery costs, which are projected to make EVs more accessible (Nafde, 2024). This strategy mirrors global trends where successful EV policy support, like that seen in Norway, eventually transitions from direct financial incentives to broader ecosystem enhancements, such as charging infrastructure development and regulatory measures (Figenbaum et al., 2015; Lindsay & Emimal, 2023). However, abruptly ceasing these financial incentives could significantly impede the sales trajectory of battery electric vehicles, potentially delaying widespread adoption by as much as a decade (Broadbent et al., 2022). Stakeholders acknowledge that government incentives bolster sales, yet their effectiveness is often hampered by partial implementation and opaque procedures (Adzhani et al., 2025). Furthermore, while governmental support is critical for spurring technological progress by sharing research and development risks, the ultimate business models for electric vehicles should aim for self-sufficiency (Ziegler & Abdelkafi, 2021). The transition away from incentives must be carefully managed, as premature withdrawal before price parity with internal combustion engine vehicles is achieved could significantly hinder market growth (Albrahim et al., 2019; O'Neill et al., 2020). This is because the sudden removal of financial aid, such as exemptions from purchase stamp duty and vehicle goods and services tax, can make battery electric vehicles disproportionately more expensive than internal combustion engine vehicles, deterring potential buyers (Broadbent et al., 2022). This pricing disparity, combined with the lack of robust charging infrastructure, could severely impede the market penetration of EVs, particularly in regions where initial adoption rates have been heavily reliant on financial inducements (Jurlin, 2023). Moreover, the effectiveness of financial incentives in driving EV adoption is evident in markets such as Europe and Asia, where substantial consumer financial incentives have correlated with dramatic increases in sales growth (Broadbent et al., 2022). However, the removal of these incentives, particularly in nascent markets, could reintroduce the significant upfront cost barrier, previously offset by subsidies, thereby diminishing consumer willingness to adopt EVs (Haldankar et al., 2024). This reduction in consumer demand would subsequently disincentivize further investment in charging infrastructure, thereby creating a negative feedback loop that further constrains EV market expansion (Broadbent et al., 2022). Such a scenario could lead to a protracted period of stagnation in EV adoption, making it challenging to meet ambitious decarbonization targets (Broadbent et al., 2022). Moreover, the absence of incentives would likely exacerbate existing challenges such as high upfront costs and range anxiety, as consumers would face the full economic burden of EV ownership without governmental support (Javadnejad et al., 2023; Knittel & Tanaka, 2025). The efficacy of various fiscal and non-fiscal incentives in overcoming such barriers has been extensively studied, revealing that purchasing subsidies and tax exemptions are particularly effective in making EVs more competitive with conventional vehicles, especially when targeted at specific consumer groups (Candra, 2022; Qadir et al., 2024). Without these incentives, the economic disparity between EVs and traditional internal combustion engine vehicles becomes more pronounced, posing a significant hurdle for widespread market penetration (Javadnejad et al., 2023). This is primarily due to the elevated purchase cost of EVs, which remains a significant deterrent despite long-term savings, largely driven by expensive battery technology and limited economies of scale (Knittel & Tanaka, 2025; Sathyan et al., 2024). Consequently, the absence of incentives could perpetuate the perception of EVs as luxury items, limiting their accessibility to a broader demographic and hindering their integration into mainstream transportation (Broadbent et al., 2022; Liang & Li, 2023). This challenge is further compounded by the limited availability and accessibility of charging infrastructure, which, without incentives, would continue to lag behind the rapid expansion required to support a growing EV fleet (Lindsay & Emimal, 2023). The withdrawal of purchase subsidies, without corresponding countervailing measures, has been shown to result in substantial decreases in electric vehicle market share, with some estimates suggesting a drop of 21% to 42% (Nie et al., 2022). This substantial decline underscores the critical role incentives play in bridging the price gap between EVs and conventional vehicles, especially during early market development phases. For instance, analyses of the US and Dutch markets reveal that the abrupt cessation or significant reduction of subsidies directly correlates with a substantial collapse in EV sales (Mantulet, 2020). For example, when Georgia eliminated its $5,000 tax credit for EV purchases, sales plummeted by approximately 85% (Albrahim et al., 2019). Such dramatic decreases highlight the significant impact of financial incentives on consumer purchasing decisions, particularly for a technology with a higher upfront cost like electric vehicles (Wahab & Jiang, 2019; Zhou & Li, 2015). The initial purchase price disparity between EVs and internal combustion engine vehicles, driven by higher manufacturing costs, remains a primary consideration for car buyers (Bridi et al., 2024; Cruz & Tolentino, 2023). This high initial outlay acts as a significant barrier for many consumers, limiting widespread adoption even when long-term operational costs might be lower (Guo, 2024). The battery pack, constituting roughly two-thirds of the electric powertrain's cost, is the single largest contributor to this higher production cost in battery electric vehicles compared to equivalent internal combustion engine vehicles (Broadbent et al., 2022). In 2022, the average manufacturer suggested retail price for an EV in the United States was over $65,000, significantly higher than the $48,000 for internal combustion engine vehicles, primarily due to the mineral-intensive nature of EV battery manufacturing (See et al., 2024). Even substantial reductions in battery costs, such as a drop from $161/kWh to $100/kWh, would only reduce the average EV MSRP by a modest $1,525, insufficient to offset the observed price differences between EVs and ICEVs (See et al., 2024). Despite an 89% decrease in battery pack prices since 2011, the inflation-adjusted Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price of the average EV has continued to climb due to simultaneous increases in horsepower and feature density (See et al., 2024). However, decreasing battery costs have still offered substantial savings, with a $1/kWh decline in lagged battery costs associating with a $25 reduction in EV MSRP, accumulating to approximately $30,750 in savings between 2011 and 2023 (See et al., 2024). Despite these past savings, projections indicate that cost parity between mid-range EVs and internal combustion engines may not be achieved until after 2025, thereby prolonging the necessity of subsidies to maintain affordability and market competitiveness (Jetin, 2023).

This is the legacy she connects to decades of drinking water contaminated with trichloroethylene, also known as TCE, on Tucson’s south side.

Sitting at a concrete picnic table outside the Pueblo Neighborhood Center, Herrera, 73, remembers how water contaminated with TCE — from about the 1940s to the 1980s — impacted her family, and how it led to her involvement in advocating for clean water for more than 30 years.

For decades, families on Tucson’s south side have lived with the consequences of water contamination: burying loved ones, organizing for accountability and forcing federal and local agencies to reckon with the damage. Many of these families helped build Southern Arizona’s environmental justice movement. Now, as they age, longtime advocates like Herrera are focused on something else: ensuring that the history and unfinished fight for clean water are passed to a new generation.

Herrera’s mother, Josie Herrera lived to be 96, but was diagnosed in her 60s with a rare, deadly cancer.

“She went through surgery and treatment. She had a cadaver bone put in her jaw. Part of her hip was taken to put in her jaw, to rebuild the jaw, because the cancer just ate away, so she ended up with no teeth,” Herrera says.

“It was horrible watching my mother try to recover and eat,” she says. Her voice catches. She holds back tears.

Her mother later developed leukemia as well. Her last two years were the most painful, Herrera says.

She pauses for a moment, looks up at the sky, a moment of silence before she talks about her sister’s battle with cancer and about her many Sunnyside High School classmates who died of cancer.

Her sister, Becki Quintero, also was diagnosed with cancer. She’s in her 70s.

“She is a survivor, and I hope she continues to be a survivor,” Herrera says.

Quintero’s son, James, died of cancer. Non-hodgkin’s lymphoma. He was in his 40s.

“He had the one that you can survive. But he did not,” she said. “After a year plus of treatment, he just didn’t make it.”

Another sister, Cecelia Herrera, also is a cancer survivor.

Since at least the early 1950s, Hughes Aircraft, the U.S. Air Force and other companies discharged TCE and other contaminants, an industrial solvent that at the time was used to degrease planes, into areas of Tucson’s south side. Some, including Herrera, say the pollution started in the 1940s, when three massive hangars — where military aircraft were cleaned — were built at the Tucson International Airport near San Xavier District of the Tohono O’odham Nation.

In 1942, Consolidated Vultee Aircraft Corporation (later a division of General Dynamics) built the hangars to modify B-24 bombers, according to the Tucson Airport Authority.

The contamination resulted in cancer cases and other rare illnesses from drinking the water until the wells were closed by 1983.

At the time, TCE in Tucson’s water source was just one of many toxic waste dumps across the country. As communities started learning about how toxic waste could impact their health and drawing national attention to it, Congress established the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act in 1980, more commonly known as Superfund. The law created a tax on chemical and petroleum industries. It also established broad federal “authority to respond directly to releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances that may endanger public health or the environment,” using trust fund revenue generated from the taxes to clean up hazardous waste sites..

The Environmental Protection Agency added the Tucson International Airport Area to the Superfund list in 1983. The approximately 24-square mile site includes the airport, parts of Tohono O’odham Nation, South Tucson residential areas and Air Force Plant #44. The federally-owned military plant is a weapons manufacturing facility operated by Raytheon Missile Systems Company, formerly Hughes Missile Systems, according to the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality.

An EPA investigation cited one source of the contamination: Air Force Plant #44.

The contaminated groundwater at the site is part of the Santa Cruz Basin — the aquifer Tucsn uses as its principal source of water. Contaminated city wells in the area have been shut down.

The decades-long fight to clean up the contamination continues today with leaders like Herrera —- who co-chairs a Superfund community advisory board — involving young people in holding the government accountable for protecting their health and making their water safe to drink again.

Taking the torch from her father

In the early 1980s, Herrera’s father, Manuel Herrera Jr., and community organizer Lorraine Lee traveled to Washington D.C. to raise awareness about the rare illnesses they were seeing in their community.

“Dad ended up being a community advocate from age 55 until, pretty much until he passed away,” she says. Manuel Herrera Jr. died in 2021.

It took years of public pressure, including extensive community organizing by Tucson’s south side families, an investigative journalism series by Jane Kay with the Arizona Daily Star, and a series of lawsuits before Hughes Aircraft, city officials and other parties would admit to any wrongdoing.

In June 1985, a month after Kay’s series was published, Tucsonans for a Clean Environment was formed. By then, community members already knew their drinking water had been polluted by the military industry. A school teacher kept a list of neighbors who had become ill, and hundreds of residents had shared their stories with Kay, as she reported on the contamination.

Members of Tucsonans for a Clean Environment would be the first in a long line of environmental justice advocates from Southern Arizona.

Manuel Herrera Jr. was a founding member of the Sunnyside Neighborhood Association in 1988. He also helped create the Unified Community Advisory Board in 1995, which allowed residents to have a formal voice in the EPA’s clean-up process.

The advisory group provides “a public forum for community members to present and discuss their needs and concerns related to the Superfund decision-making process,” as well as offers EPA officials an opportunity “to hear and seriously consider community preferences for site cleanup and remediation,” according to the EPA.

Yolanda Herrera joined the Sunnyside Neighborhood Association and started attending advisory board meetings in the early 1990s, after her father suggested she get involved. She is now the community co-chair.

In a video interview currently on display at Tucson’s Museum of Contemporary Art, part of the exhibit Living With Injury, Herrera tells the interviewer, environmental scientist Denise Moreno Ramírez, that the Unified Community Advisory Board was created so residents could speak to the government agencies responsible for the water contamination.

“And look them in the eye and ask them the hard questions and make sure that they weren’t going to try to lessen the effects that we were suffering,” Herrera says in the video. “We needed to be in front of them so that they know what they did to this community.”

The MOCA exhibit was co-curated by environmental scientist Sunaura Taylor, who wrote a book about southside Tucson’sTCE contamination and the struggle for environmental justice, titled, “Disabled Ecologies: Lessons from a Wounded Desert.” Taylor’s book examines the contaminations “ripple effects through the largely Mexican American community.

Fellow curator, historian Alisha Vasquez is co-director of the Mexican American Heritage and History Museum at the Sosa-Carrillo House. The exhibit features work by artists, journalists, and researchers including Alex! Jimenez, Franc Contreras, and Ramírez. It’s part of Survival and Resistance, a yearlong project that aims to acknowledge the harm Tucsonans experienced and to celebrate the progress and knowledge of southside organizers.

Herrera said it’s important to continue to pass down that knowledge. In her decades of volunteer organizing, Herrera has worked with national and local leaders to make sure residents’ voices are taken into account as the EPA continues to clean up chemical pollution left behind. She has also worked to educate younger generations so that they can step up and continue to advocate for clean, healthy water for Tucsonans.

“We do need to encourage younger people to pick up the torch, get involved, learn about what happened, because until they learn it, it runs the risk of repeating itself,” Herrera says. “We need somebody to continue to hold our elected officials’ feet to the fire.”

El Pueblo Neighborhood Center became a hub for community members trying to organize and hold powerful companies accountable. It’s where the Unified Community Advisory Board first met and continues meeting quarterly. The El Pueblo Health Center hosted a TCE program where people impacted by the contamination could be screened and receive healthcare for certain illnesses.

In November, the El Pueblo 50 exhibition launched, commemorating 50 years of the neighborhood center’s history and its role as a community gathering space. Part of the exhibit highlights the fight for justice and accountability as TCE chemicals harmed families in the surrounding neighborhood.

“The people who literally pay with their lives”

Herrera served on the curation team for El Pueblo 50, alongside a group of other longtime residents and city leaders. Raul Aguirre, a longtime Chicano community leader and organizer, was also among that group. Aguirre was a radio show host in the early 80s. His talk show was titled, “Tabúes y Realidades: Pláticas de la Vida.”

While he wasn’t in the meeting rooms where community members gathered to demand accountability, Aguirre used his radio platform to educate the community and hold local politicians accountable. He brought in doctors, scientists, advocates, and the local elected officials “that were supposed to be doing something about this,” Aguirre says.

Aguirre was a close friend of Lorraine Lee, the Tucson community organizer and leader who traveled in the 1980s with Herrera’s father to the nation’s capital to raise awareness about the rare illnesses in their neighborhoods. They met at Pueblo High School, where he was her unofficial campaign manager when she ran for class president.

In college, he recruited her to help him reactivate the University of Arizona chapter of MEChA, which stands for Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de Aztlan, or the Chicano Student Movement of Aztlan, a student movement founded in 1969.

“She became very active in, you know, advocating for funding, advocating for investigations, advocating for the community of the south side,” Aguirre says.

By then, Lorraine Lee was a leader at Chicanos Por La Causa. In that role, she made connections with other national advocacy organizations. Aguirre credits her leadership and those connections at least partially to Tucson becoming a Superfund site.

Lorraine Lee died of throat cancer in 2007 at 52. She left behind a legacy of social justice and organizing work. As Aguirre walked through the Living with Injury exhibit on opening night in November, he felt sad knowing people had to die because of a lack of awareness or consciousness. He says it’s important to commemorate those who fought for a cleaner environment and suffered from the contamination.

“The memorials are important because those are the people who literally pay with their lives for lack of responsibility on behalf of, you know, some of the corporations and the institutions,” Aguirre says. “So I think it’s very, very important that we honor the leadership of people like Lorraine, and people who are alive, you know that are still contributing.”

“La lucha continua, the struggle continues”

In December, about a month after the Living with Injury exhibit opened at the MOCA, more than a hundred Tucsonans, many who grew up in the south side, gather near the playground at Mission Manor Park.

About a dozen people at the park hold a printed photo of their loved one who died of water contamination. They are here to see Alex! Jimenez’s new mural, “Groundwater Embodied,” a mosaic of colorful clay tiles depicting a body lying in the desert above water. Jimenez grew up on Tucson’s south side, and her artwork has centered the Sonoran Desert and water.

For the mural, Jimenez invited community members throughout the year to make clay tiles with their loved ones’ names or tiles in the shape of the body parts that were affected. The tiles with names, in the shape of a wave, were painted blue to depict water.

Before the mural unveiling, community organizers and elected leaders who grew up in the south side speak about the impact of TCE and of the region’s environmental justice movement. The sounds of creaking swings, children laughing, a basketball bouncing on the court, fills the background as Eduardo Quintana slowly walks up a ramp onto the stage and takes the microphone.

Quintana is a former employee at Hughes Aircraft and a union organizer. He helped found Tucsonans for a Clean Environment and has run for office under the Green Party several times.

“I’m shocked to be here with a megaphone in my hand and surrounded by all you people,” he says. “But needless to say, la lucha continua, the struggle continues, and it’s because of the young people, the 40-year-olds like Alicia. They’re not going to let it go, because they’re either victims, or their relatives are victims or the people who died. They will never, ever be forgotten, and that’s why the struggle will continue.”

Quintana is also featured in the MOCA exhibit. In a video interview, he tells Moreno Ramírez that the goal of Tucsonans for a Clean Environment was to get justice. He said that hasn’t happened yet.

“People lost family members,” he said. “There were deaths. People have been sick for decades, suffering.”

Before the city and aircraft companies admitted wrongdoing, members of Tucsonans for a Clean Environment knocked on doors and surveyed their neighbors. They used pins on a map to track where people were getting sick. That map almost mirrored the EPA’s map of the plume, where the highest concentration of illnesses were found closest to the wells.

“This is generational”

Eva Carrillo Dong spent a lot of time at Mission Manor Park with her close friend Dorrie Ann Duarte in high school. They played in a girls softball team at the park. And they drank water from the park’s fountains. This was in the early 1970s, before they knew the water they were drinking was contaminated and would make them sick.

Duarte was diagnosed with liver cancer and died months later. She was 23.

“She was the one I was supposed to grow old with and be on a rocking chair with, you know, talking about the good old days,” Carrillo Dong says, leaning on a cane and wearing a mask to protect herself.

Carrillo Dong has two autoimmune diseases. Because of the water contamination, family members have been diagnosed with brain tumors, liver tumors, and other cancers, she says.

That includes her father, Clemente Trejo Carrillo, and her brother, Tony Carrillo. Those who didn’t die early have seen their quality of life affected by autoimmune diseases like lupus and Sjögren’s Disease. Some women in the community have not been able to conceive, she says.

“We didn’t know that when we were 15, 16 years old, and losing parents and losing grandparents, that eventually it would come to us too, and that we would eventually become ill,” Carrillo Dong says. “And now our children have, you know, different things that are going on with them. So this is generational. It’s not just one generation, not just my parents’ generation, but it’s our generation. It’s my children’s generation.”

As generations continue to be affected by the water contamination, those same generations have organized and continue to hold leaders accountable.

Carrillo Dong watched and participated in discussions regarding water clean up, but she felt that things were moving too slow. So she worked with Roberto Jaramillo and other organizers to educate city leaders. In 2015, Carrillo Dong and Roberto Jaramillo founded Las Aguas, an organization that aims to educate people about water contamination in Tucson’s southside since the 1940’s.

Carrillo Dong is a former Sunnyside Unified School District board member. She says it’s important to continue educating youth about what happened with Tucson’s water. She hopes they continue to step up and hold elected leaders accountable for finally making their water safe to drink.

“I reflected a lot on my friend because we spent so much time at this park,” she says, holding back tears. “Having so much fun, so many good memories.”

Once the line of people taking photos in front of the mural subsides, Carillo Dong walks up to the mural and silently reads the names on the blue tiles. She places her hand on the tile with her childhood friend’s name, then on the names of family members, taking a moment to reflect on their memory.

The Interior Department said the decision stems from “national security risks” flagged by recently completed classified reports from the Department of War. Officials argue the pause gives time to reassess whether these risks can be reduced through mitigation measures.

However, the move has triggered intense pushback from states, developers, utilities, grid operators, and industry groups. Many warn that the decision could raise electricity prices, delay clean energy deployment, threaten investments, hurt reliability, and undermine years of planning and regulatory approvals.

Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum said:

“The prime duty of the United States government is to protect the American people. Today’s action addresses emerging national security risks, including the rapid evolution of the relevant adversary technologies, and the vulnerabilities created by large-scale offshore wind projects with proximity near our east coast population centers. The Trump administration will always prioritize the security of the American people.”

National Security Concerns Take Center Stage

According to the Interior Department, the pause affects major U.S. offshore wind projects, including:

The following leases are paused:

Vineyard Wind 1 (OCS-A 0501)

Revolution Wind (OCS-A 0486)

CVOW – Commercial (OCS-A 0483)

Sunrise Wind (OCS-A 0487)

Empire Wind 1 (OCS-A 0512)

Officials claim large offshore wind turbines can interfere with national defense radar systems. Their rotating blades and reflective towers can create what’s called “radar clutter,” which may obscure real targets or generate false signals — a concern highlighted in earlier U.S. government assessments. A 2024 Department of Energy report noted that raising radar thresholds to reduce this clutter could also mean missing actual threats.

Interior Secretary Doug Burgum framed the pause as a security-first decision, saying the administration must prioritize protecting Americans amid evolving adversary capabilities.

Industry Pushes Back: “We’ve Already Cleared Defense Reviews”

The BBC reported that developers and energy leaders strongly dispute the need for the pause. Dominion Energy, developer of the major Virginia offshore wind project, stressed that its site is far offshore and has not caused security issues. The company noted its two pilot turbines have operated for five years without any national security concerns. Still, Dominion’s stock fell over 3% following the announcement, while Danish developer Ørsted sank 12%, and turbine maker Vestas dropped 2.6%.

Similarly, S&P Global also highlighted that the National Ocean Industries Association (NOIA) called the action unnecessary. President Erik Milito said all projects under construction had already passed Department of Defense coordination and clearance through rigorous legal processes. He urged the administration to end the pause quickly and highlighted that defense officials were engaged at every permitting stage.

The same S&P Global report also cited that the Oceantic Network, representing the offshore wind industry, called the decision a “veiled attempt” to derail offshore wind progress, arguing it contradicts years of multi-agency review and previous Pentagon approvals. The network warned the pause could delay nearly 6 GW of new power capacity — at a time of rapidly rising electricity demand — while driving prices higher and discouraging investment.

Political and Legal Fallout Intensifies

Governors and state leaders are sounding alarm bells. Connecticut Governor Ned Lamont criticized the decision as “erratic,” saying it will raise electricity costs and disrupt jobs and predictability for businesses. Many of these projects are nearing completion or already supplying power, and states argue that sudden federal reversals undermine economic confidence.

The pause also arrives after the administration has suffered multiple legal defeats. Earlier in December, a federal judge rejected a broader wind project ban, calling it “arbitrary and capricious.” Courts also blocked attempts to halt Revolution Wind and overturned the January permitting freeze. Analysts at ClearView Energy Partners suggested the timing of the new pause may be a strategic response — a “counterpunch” to recent judicial losses.

Meanwhile, 17 states led by New York are already challenging earlier wind restrictions, calling them an “existential threat” to the U.S. wind industry. That broader political and legal confrontation is now expected to deepen.

Grid Reliability Concerns: “We Need Every Electron”

Energy security isn’t just about defense — it’s also about keeping the lights on. Former FERC Chairman Neil Chatterjee sharply criticized the pause, calling it reckless at a time when the U.S. needs every available power source. With electricity demand projected to surge — especially from artificial intelligence data centers — offshore wind plays a growing role in supporting grid reliability.

ISO New England echoed the concern. Vineyard Wind is already feeding power to the grid, while Revolution Wind is expected to be online by 2026. Both are built into regional power planning and winter reliability strategies, when offshore wind often performs strongest while other energy supplies tighten. Pausing or canceling them, ISO warned, would raise costs and increase reliability risks.

Offshore Wind Was Finally Gaining Momentum: Wood Mackenzie

Before the pause, the U.S. offshore wind market was finally building traction after years of delays, inflation pressures, supply chain constraints, and permitting battles. Wood Mackenzie projected strong growth ahead, forecasting 46 GW of new U.S. wind capacity from 2025 to 2029 across onshore and offshore projects combined.

The U.S. offshore sector had begun recovering from cost overruns and contract cancellations. Near-term projects targeting 2026 commercial operation were advancing, even though post-2027 developments still faced hurdles like limited installation vessel capacity and tariff uncertainty. Major players like Ørsted and Equinor were restructuring finances and navigating policy headwinds, but momentum was slowly returning.

Wood Mackenzie expected total national wind capacity to reach nearly 197 GW by the end of the decade — including 6 GW of offshore wind. A peak year of 12 GW or more installations was forecast for 2027. This new federal pause now threatens to disrupt that trajectory.

A High-Stakes Crossroads for U.S. Clean Energy

Energy markets also feel the shock. S&P Global reported growing concern within the sector that halting projects could tighten power supply and worsen price pressures, especially in high-demand regions like the Northeast. Many experts warn that the U.S. can’t afford to pull back on clean energy just as consumption is projected to surge.",https://carboncredits.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/shutterstock_1116428414.jpg,N,,2025-12-30 16:58:22.919750

MarketNewsUpdates.com News Commentary

NEW YORK, Dec. 30, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Zero-carbon nuclear electricity plays a critical role in the global transition to clean energy by providing reliable, large-scale power with virtually no direct greenhouse gas emissions. Unlike intermittent renewable sources such as wind and solar, nuclear plants operate at high capacity factors, delivering steady baseload electricity regardless of weather or time of day. This reliability makes nuclear power especially valuable for decarbonizing industrial sectors and supporting electric grids with growing shares of variable renewables, while maintaining energy security. Industry research indicates that the global nuclear power market is expected to grow steadily into 2026. Multiple market analysts project the market value to be in the approximate range of $38–42 billion in 2026. One report estimates the market at about $40.48 billion in 2025 and rising to roughly $41.68 billion in 2026, reflecting a multi-year expansion trend as nuclear capacity increases worldwide and investments in plant life extensions and new builds continue. - The market for zero-carbon nuclear electricity is shaped by policy frameworks, capital costs, and technological innovation. Government support through carbon pricing, clean energy standards, and long-term power purchase agreements has become a key driver of new investments and life-extension projects for existing reactors. At the same time, advanced reactor designs—including small modular reactors (SMRs)—are gaining attention for their potential to reduce upfront costs, improve safety, and serve niche markets such as remote regions, data centers, and industrial heat applications. Active companies in the markets this week include DevvStream Corp. (NASDAQ: DEVS), XCF Global Inc. (NASDAQ: SAFX), Trump Media & Technology Group Corp. (NASDAQ: DJT), Constellation Energy Corporation (NASDAQ: CEG) and NuScale Power Corporation (NYSE: SMR).

Despite its advantages, the nuclear electricity market faces challenges that affect competitiveness, including high initial investment requirements, long project timelines, and public perception concerns related to safety and waste management. However, as countries commit to net-zero targets and seek firm, zero-carbon power sources, nuclear energy is increasingly viewed as a complement to renewables rather than a competitor. This evolving perspective is driving renewed interest in nuclear electricity as a strategic asset within a diversified, low-carbon energy market. Looking ahead, the zero-carbon nuclear electricity market is positioned for measured but durable growth. Challenges remain—particularly around project execution, waste management, and public acceptance—but the macro drivers of decarbonization, electrification, and energy security are structural and long-term. As grids demand clean, reliable power at scale, nuclear energy is likely to secure a larger and more resilient role in the global electricity mix, supporting both climate objectives and economic competitiveness.

DevvStream, Southern, IP3, and XCF to Evaluate Development of America-First Nuclear Power, Advanced Fuels, and Digital Environmental Asset Monetization - Potential to advance next-generation eSAF pathways by pairing continuous clean electricity with electrolysis, hydrogen production, and low-carbon fuel synthesis - DevvStream Corp. (NASDAQ: DEVS) ($DEVS) (""DevvStream""), a leading carbon management and environmental-asset monetization firm, today announced a non-binding memorandum of understanding (""MOU"") to evaluate a strategic collaboration focused on small modular reactor (""SMR"") nuclear power development, electro-sustainable aviation fuel (""eSAF"") production, and the creation, verification, and monetization of eligible environmental attributes alongside IP3 Corporation (""IP3""), Southern Energy Renewables Inc. (""Southern""), and XCF Global Inc. (NASDAQ: SAFX) (""XCF"") (together ""the parties"").

The MOU outlines a proposed integrated framework to assess the development and deployment of firm, zero-carbon nuclear electricity from SMRs to support clean fuel production and energy-intensive end markets, including AI data centers, while enabling robust environmental-attribute structures that may meet evolving compliance, reporting, and market standards. The MOU also outlines a framework to explore the development and deployment of SMR-generated electricity to support existing and future operating assets, including a potential nuclear power solution for a proposed SAF refinery in Louisiana, and to enable a scalable portfolio of verifiable environmental attributes.

If pursued, the parties intend to advance reliable, zero-carbon nuclear power to enable continuous electrolysis, hydrogen production, and downstream fuel synthesis, while also supporting excess clean-power offtake for third-party customers where appropriate.

The parties also intend to evaluate, as part of the negotiation of definitive agreements, environmental-attribute structures associated with eSAF and related low-carbon fuel pathways, including emerging ""book-and-claim"" and SAF certificate frameworks that allow airlines and corporate buyers to access verified in-sector emissions reduction attributes when physical fuel delivery is constrained.

In parallel, and pending the execution of definitive agreements, the MOU contemplates future development of digital infrastructure to enhance transparency, provenance, and auditability, including tokenization of eligible environmental assets and the use of digital measurement, reporting, and verification (""MRV"") systems to support data quality, provenance, and auditability.

""Together, we are exploring real-world asset and tokenized environmental-asset frameworks with the potential to unlock additional value, improve liquidity, and help lower the delivered cost of clean energy and fuels,"" said Sunny Trinh, Chief Executive Officer of DevvStream. ""We see this as a potential America-first model that combines U.S. resources, digital infrastructure, and scalable markets.""

""This MOU reflects our focus on putting American energy, infrastructure, and production first,"" said Jay Patel, Chief Executive Officer of Southern Energy Renewables. ""As the development of advanced nuclear platforms gain momentum, we believe the goal of developing and deploying firm, domestic power is becoming essential for fuels, manufacturing, and data-driven industries. We are committed to exploring how nuclear power, combined with U.S. biomass resources, can enable an integrated, multi-product approach that strengthens U.S. industrial leadership while remaining globally competitive.""

RDML (Ret.) Mike Hewitt, Chief Executive Officer of IP3, added: ""Clean, reliable nuclear power is increasingly being pursued as foundational infrastructure for American energy security and industrial growth. We are excited to explore a strategic relationship with XCF, DevvStream, and Southern, including the potential deployment of small modular reactor technology to provide firm power and support e‑SAF production for European markets. IP3's business model to develop infrastructure projects to privatize Small Modular Reactors for multiple offtakers such as AI and data centers that support government and commercial requirements. We believe pairing firm power development with practical environmental‑asset design and monetization can create a differentiated platform that meets real customer demand while delivering the transparency the market expects.""

Constellation Energy Corporation (NASDAQ: CEG) was recently awarded ""Energy Deal of the Year"" at the 2025 Platts Global Energy Awards for its 20-year power purchase agreement with Microsoft that paved the way for the launch of the Crane Clean Energy Center and restart of Unit 1 in Londonderry, Pa. This historic restart stands as a defining moment for American nuclear power and commercial interest in nuclear energy to power the data economy.

""We're very proud of our team's tireless work to make the Crane restart possible. This project will create more than 3,000 jobs, add over $16 billion to Pennsylvania's GDP, and generate more than $3 billion in community supporting taxes,"" said Dan Eggers, Constellation Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. ""This award demonstrates the transformative impact of working together with partners like Microsoft and Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro to meet the region's growing energy needs and put 835 MWs of clean, reliable power back on the grid at a critical time.""

NuScale Power Corporation (NYSE: SMR), the industry-leading provider of proprietary and innovative advanced small modular reactor (SMR) nuclear technology, recently congratulated its exclusive global strategic partner, ENTRA1 Energy, on being positioned to receive up to $25 billion in investment capital under the newly signed $550 billion U.S.-Japan Framework Agreement.

The bilateral framework agreement, announced by the White House following a meeting between President Donald J. Trump and Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi in Tokyo this week, will mobilize up to $550 billion in public- and private-sector investment to expand critical energy infrastructure and strengthen supply chains.

As part of this initiative, ENTRA1 Energy will develop a fleet of power plants utilizing baseload energy sources. The program will serve fast-growing energy demand from AI data centers, manufacturing and national defense, while creating thousands of high-quality American jobs and reinforcing U.S. energy independence.

Gas turbines provide firm capacity and remain the option for many large players deploying data centers.
Lastly, dual-use climate technologies with superior unit economics that happen to strengthen domestic supply chains.
But there will be a lot more talk of a build-out bubble (in data centers, not electricity generation).
Yes, there’s been massive excitement around everything connected to data centers, energy generation, storage, transmission, cooling.","There will still be the need for more power, though, and investors saw geothermal, nuclear, solar, and batteries as having benefited from the boom. “Zero-carbon generation is already among the cheapest sources of power, and growing demand for both grid-scale and distributed batteries is accelerating cost reductions faster than expected,” said Daniel Goldman, managing partner at Clean Energy Ventures.

Investors also acknowledged the AI bubble might burst; some voiced skepticism about whether it would drag the energy sector down with it.

“Could a bubble burst in 2026? Sure,” said Kyle Teamey, managing partner at RA Capital Planetary Health. But it’s not likely to affect infrastructure plans, he added. “The spending for 2026 is already budgeted. The train has left the station.”

Andrew Beebe, managing director at Obvious Ventures, thinks the data center bubble might burst in 2026 or early 2027, but that no such bubble exists in electricity generation. “We still need a LOT more power, and we’ll use that — no build-out bubble there … yet.”

Outside of AI and data centers, Anil Achyuta, partner at Energy Impact Partners, said reindustrialization will take more of the spotlight this year. “We need to rebuild supply chains for systems that require multiple components and complex flowsheets,” he said, citing robotics, batteries, and power electronics as examples.

The continuing quest for power

Thanks to the drumbeat of new data center announcements, energy-related startups have gotten a boost this past year, perhaps none more than those working on nuclear fission. In the last few weeks, nuclear startups have announced rounds totaling over $1 billion, leading to speculation that many will SPAC or go public through a traditional IPO in 2026.

“Nuclear everything is in vogue right now,” Teamey said.

But it will take a while for nuclear power to make a dent in electricity demand. In the meantime, tech companies and data center developers have been turning to solar and batteries as inexpensive, rapidly deployable power sources. Grid-scale batteries, in particular, have been a major beneficiary, seeing record-setting deployments in 2025. As alternative battery chemistries like sodium-ion and zinc come to market, they stand to lower costs and drive further adoption.

“We’ll see growth in 2026 with new plays on [battery] chemistry and business models.” said Leo Banchik, director at Voyager. “One of the key lessons from earlier failures was scaling gigafactories before proving demand or achieving better unit economics than the status quo. The new wave is more disciplined.”

Several investors felt geothermal would step in to help fill the void in the coming years. It helps that investors see enhanced geothermal as a relatively mature technology that’s ready to deploy at larger scales in 2026.

“Geothermal will be hot on solar’s heals in terms of new generation,” said Joshua Posamentier, managing partner at Congruent Ventures. “Natural gas assets are growing pretty linearly. There’s not much new capacity in turbine manufacturing coming online, and they’re selling everything they can. Geothermal will go geometric.”

And while AI is helping to drive demand, companies and technologies that think beyond the data center will benefit the most, said Laurie Menoud, founding partner at At One Ventures. “Data centers are one demand driver, not the whole market.”

Which startup is most likely to go public in 2026?

Not everyone was in agreement or would proffer a guess. But among those who did, several said nuclear or geothermal startups were most likely to go public, either via IPO or SPAC.

The name mentioned most was Fervo, the enhanced geothermal startup that recently raised a $462 million round. The company is widely seen as a leader in the sector and is in the midst of building a 500-megawatt development in Utah that should serve as a template for future power plants. Tapping the public markets would give the company more reserves to tackle additional projects.

Trends to watch

Beyond data centers, investors are interested in a range of technologies and sectors, including critical minerals, robotics, and software to manage the electrical grid.

“We should be paying more attention to grid execution as a category,” said Amy Duffuor, general partner at Azolla Ventures. “The quiet winners are companies that make interconnection, planning, and deployment faster software, hardware, and supply-chain solutions that help utilities actually move projects forward.”

Resiliency and adaptation will be big themes in 2026, according to Coca of Toyota Ventures and Posamentier of Congruent Ventures. Achyuta at EIP zeroed in on one potential application: robots that bury electrical transmission lines quicker and more cheaply than humans, mitigating wildfire risks and increasing the grid’s reliability.

Beebe, at Obvious Ventures, said that EV trucking would also be an area to watch. “One of the biggest pieces of news of 2026 is going to be the release and specs behind the Tesla Semi. The range and pricing of that vehicle will change that industry in ways as powerful as the Model S or 3.”

AI, of course, is likely to play a role in climate tech’s transformation. “We will see massive innovation where AI meets the physical world in 2026 on both the infrastructure and consumer app layers,” said Matt Rogers, founder at Incite and Mill. “Combining AI with smart hardware and physical infrastructure will ensure the transformation of trillion-dollar industries from manufacturing to life sciences to food systems.”

But it might also pay to keep an eye on technologies that have already been written off, said Bronson at SOSV. “When investors finally get tired of a sector and come to the conclusion it won’t pan out, that’s when the real breakthroughs finally happen,” he said.

Below are the detailed comments from the investors who replied to TechCrunch’s survey, listed in alphabetical order. Click the link to jump to a specific response.

Anil Achyuta, partner at Energy Impact Partner

Data centers have dominated conversations about energy in 2025. What should we expect in 2026?

Reindustrialization beyond data centers will be a major theme. We need to rebuild supply chains for systems that require multiple components and complex flowsheets. For example, supporting next-generation robotics to address labor shortages and national security concerns will require integrated supply chains. Batteries, power electronics, fuel cells, gas turbines, and even home building are examples of end markets/technologies where parts of the value chain will need to be reindustrialized.

Another area to watch is AI-driven physical science. While companies like Zanskar (predictive AI for geothermal) and Fabric8Labs (generative cooling for data centers) have shown promise, we haven’t seen many visible breakthroughs yet. That said, the talent pool working on these problems is impressive and could lead to exciting developments.

Where is the biggest opportunity to find or place power on the grid?

Gas turbines provide firm capacity and remain the option for many large players deploying data centers. Beyond that, batteries — particularly sodium-ion — represent one of the most economical and near-term solutions at the grid-scale. I am bullish about the progress in this technology, and pairing solar with batteries (as companies like Peak Energy are doing) continues to be a highly attractive approach. Next-gen geothermal is also showing a good amount of promise but the timelines are like that of nuclear, potent but will take about a decade to bring full capacity online.

In addition, algorithmic solutions to unlock new power using existing infrastructure (e.g., Gridcare, ThinkLabs AI) and optimize workloads (e.g., Emerald AI) can further enhance grid efficiency. There are also other innovations worth noting in bringing more power, such as applying optical coating to transmission lines to reduce losses being advanced by AssetCool (an EIP portfolio company).

Which climate tech or clean energy startup is most likely to IPO in 2026?

Fervo Energy, Commonwealth Fusion, Redwood Materials would be my personal guesses, but I could be wrong.

Which technologies do you think will be ready to deploy at larger scales in 2026?

Sodium-ion batteries for grid-scale storage are already being deployed and will accelerate significantly in 2026. Another technology to watch is solid-state transformers (note Heron Power is an EIP portfolio company). The industry is advancing faster than expected and scale similarly to semiconductors, though at-scale production might take longer.

What trend or technology should we be paying more attention to?

One emerging trend is the underground build-out of transmission lines. Advances in robotics could enable a rapid, cost-effective approach that significantly reduces wildfire risk and, in turn, mitigates the substantial carbon emissions associated with such events.

Distributed power, heat, and computation are the last class of trends we are curiously tracking for 2026.

Leo Banchik, director at Voyager

Data centers have dominated conversations about energy in 2025. What should we expect in 2026?

Data centers will keep driving record power demand as AI workloads scale. Despite talk of overbuild, we’re unlikely to see much stranded capacity — as compute gets cheaper and more available, we’ll keep finding new uses for it. The interesting shift is hyperscalers differentiating between clean power sources — firm vs. intermittent, location, and additionality — rather than just headline megawatt-hours. This is already playing out in bespoke offtake deals and on-site supply strategies.

Fission and geothermal should see continued momentum from both private capital and federal support. Fusion will likely attract increased federal support as geopolitical competition intensifies, though we’re still many years away from high-capacity-factor grid-scale deployment.

Natural gas peaker alternatives will gain traction too — using new turbines and modular designs with integrated carbon capture as grids manage new peak demands from AI.

Where is the biggest opportunity to find or place power on the grid?

Solar and battery build-out will continue given their strong economics. For dispatchable, 24/7 baseload power, we’ll see growth in fission, geothermal, and peaker alternatives like modular gas turbines with integrated carbon capture. There’s also a grid-edge opportunity worth watching: large facilities procuring dedicated baseload on-site rather than adding to grid congestion.

Which climate tech or clean energy startup is most likely to IPO in 2026?

Most likely fission or geothermal. These companies have raised substantial capital and built strong offtake agreements with hyperscalers and utilities. With multibillion-dollar project pipelines and the need for continued growth financing, several could pursue public markets in 2026.

Which technologies do you think will be ready to deploy at larger scales in 2026?

Energy storage deployment is accelerating across residential, commercial, industrial (including data center backup), and grid-scale applications. Domestic supply chains, including second-life battery systems, are gaining traction for stationary storage. We’ll see growth in 2026 with new plays on chemistry and business models. One of the key lessons from earlier failures was scaling gigafactories before proving demand or achieving better unit economics than the status quo. The new wave is more disciplined.

Industrial heat pumps and thermal storage systems for steam and process heat are becoming cheaper to operate than gas boilers in many regions and applications, especially where waste heat is available and electricity prices are favorable.

We’ll also see more growth in critical minerals and battery materials projects — lithium, rare earth, magnesium refining; battery component and cell manufacturing; copper recycling — maturing with federal support as supply chain security becomes a strategic priority.

What trend or technology should we be paying more attention to?

Software and AI enabling physical infrastructure: real-time factory intelligence that improves energy efficiency and manufacturing yields, AI-based design tools that speed up product development cycles, grid management software that orchestrates intermittent renewables with storage and dispatchable power.

Companies taking a clean-sheet approach to reimagining foundational technologies — a SpaceX-style rethink of components once considered solved problems. Motor designs that eliminate rare earth dependencies, grid infrastructure like transformers with modern manufacturing techniques, advanced materials processing that significantly reduces costs while improving quality. Improvements in robotics help to enable these cost curves, making U.S. manufacturing economically viable where it wasn’t before.

Lastly, dual-use climate technologies with superior unit economics that happen to strengthen domestic supply chains. Defense and industrial policy are backing these not for climate reasons, but because they deliver cost advantages and supply security.

Andrew Beebe, managing director at Obvious Ventures

Data centers have dominated conversations about energy in 2025. What should we expect in 2026?

Data centers will again dominate. But there will be a lot more talk of a build-out bubble (in data centers, not electricity generation). We will live with the dual reality of too much money/debt spent on data centers, and the speculation bubble will likely burst (maybe early 2027). But at the same time, we’ll still need a LOT more power, and will use that — no build-out bubble there … yet.

Where is the biggest opportunity to find or place power on the grid?

For power generation: geothermal in the near-term. Fission in the mid-term. Fusion in the 10-year-plus long-term.

For batteries — PJM [the grid that covers the mid-Atlantic west to parts of Illinois] and Texas.

Which climate tech or clean energy startup is most likely to IPO in 2026?

Venture-backed: Fervo

Which technologies do you think will be ready to deploy at larger scales in 2026?

Geothermal and grid-scale batteries.

What trend or technology should we be paying more attention to?

Grid software and EV trucking. One of the biggest pieces of news of 2026 is going to be the release and specs behind the Tesla Semi. The range and pricing of that vehicle will change that industry in ways as powerful as the Model S or 3.

Po Bronson, managing director at SOSV’s IndieBio

Data centers have dominated conversations about energy in 2025. What should we expect in 2026?

I’m still hearing about an ever increasing concentration of effort and focus on data centers virtually every single day in meetings, especially with corporates. To some extent this is from “picks and shovels” companies who don’t want to get commoditized so they’re strategizing how to be a bigger player/more integrated rather than just a component that’s purchased.

A related phrase I hear more frequently is power density and/or specific power (power to weight), as a load of corporates are anticipating or planning how their energy divisions branch into robotics. Duncan Turner here is our expert.

Which climate tech or clean energy startup is most likely to IPO in 2026?

I don’t have a climate tech company in my portfolio going public in 2026. Tidal Vision is targeting 2027. That’s my closest. I don’t want to opine on other VC’s portfolio companies, even though I have my feelings, because I shouldn’t open my mouth where I’m only partially informed.

Which technologies do you think will be ready to deploy at larger scales in 2026?

For larger scales in 2026, my fastest scaling companies are Tidal Vision and Voyage Foods, which has taken over a General Motors plant in Ohio.

What trend or technology should we be paying more attention to?

On what to pay more attention to, I’ll toot Duncan’s horn here again — what he’s doing with the Plasma Forge is IMHO going to be super compelling and make everyone study at night.

One last note is my consistent feeling that it’s when investors finally get tired of a sector and come to the conclusion it won’t pan out that the real breakthroughs finally happen. I learned this lesson back in 1999 when we were all wondering if the search space was going to be won by Yahoo, AltaVista, Excite, Lycos, or Infoseek.

I do feel like that’s happening in my personal portfolio. I said this to AgFunder recently, but when the VC world asks about winning sectors, there’s a presumption that the sector will be so hot that there will be multiple winners. Most markets don’t have multiple winners, and the sector doesn’t win; just one company wins.

Tom Chi, founding partner at At One Ventures

Data centers have dominated conversations about energy in 2025. What should we expect in 2026?

There will be a lot more around data centers in 2026. They are creating their own financial ecosystem, and there is enough actual momentum in current AI efforts that I don’t see the hyperscalers pulling back in 2026.

Where is the biggest opportunity to find or place power on the grid?

Budgets for hyperscalers are in the $50 billion to $100 billion range, which encompasses power, chips, and much more. The chips are expensive enough that folks are willing to pay a bit more to get power on the grid sooner as the losses from chip depreciation are greater than most things you could incrementally add to your power scale-up budget.

Which climate tech or clean energy startup is most likely to IPO in 2026?

IPO market still a bit murky, and most folks don’t telegraph exactly when they will go public.

Which technologies do you think will be ready to deploy at larger scales in 2026?

Folks like Fervo are at an interesting inflection point. One of our portcos Provectus Algae is also at an interesting point.

What trend or technology should we be paying more attention to?

We’ve had a pretty big pendulum swing away from the more capital-intensive work in industrial decarbonization that aren’t in AI. They are still critical for our collective future, even if out of fashion for a few years.

Lisa Coca, partner at Toyota Ventures

Data centers have dominated conversations about energy in 2025. What should we expect in 2026?

In our view at Toyota Ventures, the 2026 data center energy conversation is likely to shift from demand to resilience and the need to accelerate plans to decouple from the grid.

Where is the biggest opportunity to find or place power on the grid?

We believe that the biggest investment opportunities are in firm, dispatchable, and scalable carbon-free energy. We have actively invested in technologies that support increasing baseload power, both geothermal and nuclear, through portfolio companies such as Rodatherm and Natura Resources. For critical grid flexibility, we are backing advanced, long-duration energy storage battery technologies with an investment in e-Zinc.

Which climate tech or clean energy startup is most likely to IPO in 2026?

We anticipate that nuclear power will continue to lead the way in terms of IPOs and SPACs in 2026.

Which technologies do you think will be ready to deploy at larger scales in 2026?

Challenging question since we believe it is more a function of how, and if, the capital stack continues to evolve. There is a healthy number of climate tech companies across multiple sectors that are on the cusp of deploying at a larger scale. The biggest hurdle is securing FOAK financing to de-risk the all-important step of advancing from first of a kind to nth of a kind.

What trend or technology should we be paying more attention to?

Our team expects resiliency and adaptation will continue to reign strong in 2026. The Toyota Ventures portfolio illustrates this: BurnBot addresses wildfire mitigation, ZymoChem bolsters supply chain resilience with sustainable materials, and Alora creates adaptable resource solutions.

Amy Duffuor, general partner at Azolla Ventures

Data centers have dominated conversations about energy in 2025. What should we expect in 2026?

My prediction is that the energy conversation shifts from generation of power to how fast power can actually be delivered. Interconnection timelines, permitting, and physical grid constraints continue to be a bottleneck and data centers will increasingly rely on hybrid strategies that blend grid power, storage, and demand flexibility to hit timelines.

Where is the biggest opportunity to find or place power on the grid?

One opportunity is at grid-ready sites, like places with existing transmission and substation. Anything that shortens interconnection timelines creates outsized value right now because access to the grid is scarce. Also interested in wireless transmission of power even though it’s in the early stages.

Which climate tech or clean energy startup is most likely to IPO in 2026?

There has been a lot of talk about Fervo Energy…!

Which technologies do you think will be ready to deploy at larger scales in 2026?

Long-duration energy storage technology companies, which will move from initial pilots to demos to repeatable deployments. We’re particularly excited about our portfolio company Noon Energy.

What trend or technology should we be paying more attention to?

We should be paying more attention to grid execution as a category. The quiet winners are companies that make interconnection, planning, and deployment faster software, hardware, and supply-chain solutions that help utilities actually move projects forward.

Daniel Goldman, managing partner at Clean Energy Ventures

Data centers have dominated conversations about energy in 2025. What should we expect in 2026?

We expect to see an acceleration of deal making in the data center/hyperscaler space consisting of the following:

While we don’t expect an overall “bust cycle” for data center and hyperscaler development activities, we do expect some rationalization of development and implementation of efficiency options to reduce capacity needs.

Where is the biggest opportunity to find or place power on the grid?

The greatest near-term opportunity — and challenge — lies in improving the grid itself. Grid modernization through digitalization, decarbonization, and decentralization will unlock cost savings, optimize existing infrastructure, and better integrate significant distributed energy resources — probably not saying anything new here. Zero-carbon generation is already among the cheapest sources of power, and growing demand for both grid-scale and distributed batteries is accelerating cost reductions faster than expected.

We expect this trend to continue despite recent policy shifts in the IRA and there are hundreds of venture capital-backed companies that can have a material impact on the grid as they scale-up and see more adoption rates in the market. Disruption is here!

Which climate tech or clean energy startup is most likely to IPO in 2026?

Factorial appears to be a leading candidate following its plans to de-SPAC in 2026. Its trajectory illustrates that companies with strong customer traction in large markets, clear cost and performance advantages, and rapidly scaling revenues are well-positioned for the public markets. (This SPAC market contrasts with the 2020 one where entrants such as QuantumScape did not have meaningful revenues and perhaps were ill-prepared for public markets.)

Watch out for more companies hitting public markets on hype, instead of good fundamentals.

Beyond Factorial, several companies in energy storage, generation, and critical minerals are approaching scalable revenue levels to access low-cost of capital public markets (a real benefit), though in the minerals sector we may see growth in mergers and acquisitions precede any public offerings in 2026.

Which technologies do you think will be ready to deploy at larger scales in 2026?

Projects in energy storage, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), critical minerals, and material manufacturing facilities across the energy supply chain will see significant investment in the U.S., with manufacturing tax credits and attractive market opportunities still available notwithstanding federal policy headwinds.

In 2025, we extensively evaluated and developed new risk transfer solutions for FOAK project developers. We see commercial lenders and private credit starting to lean more heavily into this space with the support of insurance underwriting and catalytic capital. We expect to see more projects and more debt financing for early commercialization, which up until this point has only trickled in. This is the key enabler of the greater scale we need across the industry.

What trend or technology should we be paying more attention to?

For western markets to compete with China’s manufacturing and increasingly innovation prowess, financial innovation is CRITICAL. Global markets need to deploy $3 trillion to $9 trillion per year through 2050 on climate related technologies and implementation of projects if we hope to reduce global temperatures and compete in these markets internationally. Global spending on climate related investment was only $2 trillion in 2024 and is on a path for a similar amount in 2025.

To increase the rate of deployment, we must convince public and private investors that the risk-return balance is favorable to deploy capital across the climate capital stack — early-stage venture, growth-stage venture, private equity, commercial lending and private credit, and infrastructure. Our sector is not attracting enough capital; in simple terms, risks need to decline or returns need to increase.

We see opportunities to use risk-sharing mechanisms to optimize capital stacks and lower the cost of capital for new technology projects, which also brings them down the cost curve faster. Promising solutions include technology and performance risk insurance, surety bonds for managing construction risks, pooling off-take agreements among buyer groups (e.g., hyperscalers for clean power or airlines for SAF), filling gaps in construction financing, and more. Clean Energy Ventures’ spent time during 2025 identifying new risk transfer solutions working closely with our counterparts in the finance and insurance sectors. We believe 2026 will see more innovative financing solutions enabling faster scaling of climate technologies.

We should also be paying very close attention to cost curves. The impact of AI is showing up but not being widely reported in climate tech. Inside large companies and small startups the benefits of AI are driving costs down, allowing faster innovation at complex facilities and in supply chains. This is apparent in chemicals, mining and refining, power generation and grid optimization, manufacturing (steel, cement), recycling and waste management, and more.

We are only at the embryonic stage of seeing the impact of AI on the cost curves in a wide range of commodities and industries. As we talk about the upward impact on power prices driven by AI infrastructure requirements, we need to keep in mind that AI will also radically transform industries globally and reduce cost of production.

Laurie Menoud, At One Ventures

Data centers have dominated conversations about energy in 2025. What should we expect in 2026?

Yes, there’s been massive excitement around everything connected to data centers, energy generation, storage, transmission, cooling. But from a VC perspective, building and scaling data centers isn’t a startup timeline. It’s a decade-long struggle of permits, substations, and grid upgrades. To put numbers on it, hyperscale data centers take 3 to 6 years to permit and connect in the US today. In some markets, interconnection alone can exceed 5 to 7 years. So in 2026, I expect to see continued traction for energy companies that are not only tied to data centers but can expand into commercial and industrial use cases and front-of-the-meter applications. Data centers are one demand driver, not the whole market.

Related to this is the supply of critical metals, which I continue to be very focused on: mining, extraction, refining, and recycling. This is critical not only for data centers (especially copper), but also for EV batteries with lithium, nickel, manganese, and cobalt.

Where is the biggest opportunity to find or place power on the grid?

In places where thermal (coal and gas) and nuclear plants are being retired, because those sites already have high-capacity grid connections. That makes deploying new clean generation dramatically faster. In the U.S. alone, more than 60 GW of coal capacity has retired since 2015, and another 40+ GW is scheduled to retire by 2030. Each retirement frees up a transmission node that took decades to build. Reusing that interconnection is often the difference between a 2-year vs. an 8-year project timeline. And that’s where you could install next-gen nuclear reactors, like Stellaria, that cut long-lived waste, capex, opex, deployment time, and extends fuel use, or geothermal energy like Factor2 Energy, utilizing underground CO2 reservoirs for lower constraints on deployment location.

The same is true of industrial sites (chemicals, steel, refineries) that already have oversized grid connections. These sites are trying to expand production, and add storage, and they already have one of the hardest problems solved: interconnection. If you want to electrify heavy industry quickly, you go where the grid already exists.

Which climate tech or clean energy startup is most likely to IPO in 2026?

No one can really know, but the battery recycling and circular critical materials subsector is one I’d watch closely. Lithium, nickel, and cobalt prices are extremely sensitive to geopolitics, and recycling provides a lower-risk, domestic supply for the U.S.

Which technologies do you think will be ready to deploy at larger scales in 2026?

Relectrify is deploying their battery systems at commercial production scale in 2026 with a cumulative capacity of 100 MWh. They use cell-level semiconductor circuitry to individually control battery cells at high frequency, directly producing an alternating current waveform. No need for an inverter anymore, which is a direct win on CAPEX, improved usable lifetime battery capacity, and lower OPEX by identifying and replacing malfunctioning cells with precision. It’s happening now.

And overall, grid-scale energy storage beyond lithium, driven by both AI data centers and renewable growth. Without it, you simply can’t run 24/7 clean power outside of nuclear and hydro. Globally, stationary storage is projected to grow from ~45 GWh in 2023 to hundreds of GWs by 2030. Some of the new technologies are already ready today.

Battery recycling and closed-loop supply chains with automakers (recycled lithium, nickel, cobalt, and copper going back into new batteries) are also already scaling. 2026 is about acceleration. Ascend Elements has already built the largest lithium-ion battery recycling facility in North America, and has now achieved the first production of recycled lithium carbonate. Imports make up the majority of the US supply of lithium carbonate today, mostly from Argentina and Chile. If you can secure your metal supply with lower-cost recycled content, isn’t that a big win?

What trend or technology should we be paying more attention to?

Companies like Chemfinity, that could make domestic metal refining at cost parity with China, and anything tied to mining, extraction, refining, and recycling of critical metals for data centers and EVs. Copper is THE metal for data centers. It’s used in power cables, busbars, transformers, cooling loops. A single gigawatt of data-center capacity requires on the order of tens of thousands of tonnes of copper. And about 40% – 45% of the world’s copper refining is in China, followed by Chile. It’s the same geographical structure as lithium refining and battery precursor chemistry. People talk about energy security. This is what it actually looks like.

Joshua Posamentier, managing partner at Congruent Ventures

Data centers have dominated conversations about energy in 2025. What should we expect in 2026?

Push for growth will continue but attention will shift from flashy gigawatt announcements to construction, commissioning, and dealing with the brutal realities of interconnect and permitting delays. The result will be a huge upwelling of “bring your own generation” and “demand flexibility.”

The age of ASSPs/ASICs will begin in earnest for AI data centers. GPUs will continue to grow, but the rate will taper in favor of more specialist chips that are far more efficient, especially for inference loads. This will start decoupling data center power consumption from token generation.

The unit economics of the marquee foundational AI shops will leak. They will not look good. But they will convince investors to support them through their trough of upside down unit economics until they achieve positive unit economics, which will come sooner than expected. But the shine will be off: These will fall into a different bucket than high margin SaaS companies from prior bubbles.

Data centers will become far better grid participants through flexibility, load shaping, and power quality, and they will be rewarded with far faster interconnect times than other big loads — the more tech they adopt, the faster they’ll get connected.

We’ll see the first off-grid world-scale data center NTP [notice to proceed, or a letter telling a contractor to begin work]. We’ll also see more NIMBY pushback on proximate data centers because of everything from power costs to size to water use.

Where is the biggest opportunity to find or place power on the grid?

Nuclear fusion! I think we’ll see the first net gain by analysis (i.e., deuterium fusion where it would be Q>1 if it were tritium) in a startup reactor.

Geothermal will be hot on solar’s heels in terms of new generation with linearly deploying gas assets.

Which climate tech or clean energy startup is most likely to IPO in 2026?

SPAC or IPO? Lots in the pipe, pun intended.

Which technologies do you think will be ready to deploy at larger scales in 2026?

Geothermal for electricity and district heating. Friction is still way too high for single site geothermal heat loops to scale much faster than today. Thermal energy storage (load shifting) for industrial applications.

What trend or technology should we be paying more attention to?

Robotics (not the humanoid kind) are taking over a huge number of labor-intensive industries; they will impact many industrial, agriculture, waste, and manufacturing operations in 2026.

Logistics and manufacturing efficiency: electrification, efficiency, onshoring, and AI are pushing on emissions from half of the economy and these sectors are economic, not impact buyers. Give them long-term certainty on lower costs vs. conventional fuels, for example, and you’ll have buyers. This is everything from electrified autonomous trucking to electric autonomous rail and dark terminals.

Resilience technology is going to really get going. Insurance costs (due to climate risk) are outpacing every other cost for homeowners and impacting commercial operations. Businesses and individuals are going to aggressively begin to invest in resilience in the face of accelerating climate change and extreme weather but also aging infrastructure and a shift from centralized to distributed resource paradigms.

Matt Rogers, founder at Incite and Mill

Data centers have dominated conversations about energy in 2025. What should we expect in 2026?

Data centers will serve as factories for the next phase of AI innovation powering America’s society and economy. I think local governments will step up more in 2026 and challenge hyperscalers to deliver solutions that are more in line with community needs and municipal partnership that allows for swifter construction. Energy affordability is top of mind, and we really need to reverse the trend of 2025 of rising costs.

Where is the biggest opportunity to find or place power on the grid?

The call is coming from inside the house in 2026. In other words, consumers have more impact than anyone thinks. Decentralized infrastructure solutions, including rooftop solar, energy storage, and distributed energy resources, like heat pumps and smart thermostats, are available today. Households can turn them on swiftly, cost-effectively, and without the major disruptions to grids across the nation we are seeing today. It’s faster to permit than building new centralized power plants.

If enough people adopt these approachable solutions, America’s grid has a better shot at handling the increased capacity from the data center AI boom.

There’s also an alignment opportunity hiding in plain sight: AI pioneers and Big Tech companies want a faster, more predictable path to build. Local and state governments want affordability, economic investment, and resilience. Communities are actually in a unique position to trade swift permitting and flexible construction timelines for economic rejuvenation, tax revenue, and job creation from the private sector.

By enabling more efficient households with lower utility bills, hyperscalers can access the energy they need to operate AI data centers. Much faster. That’s why this isn’t a moonshot. The opposite, in fact.

Which technologies do you think will be ready to deploy at larger scales in 2026?

Mill. We’ll deploy more Food Recyclers, and on a different scale, than ever before. We’re planning more partnerships to encourage more households, businesses, and communities to view food as something to return back to the food system rather than leave for weeks in dumpsters and then years in landfills.

Robotics is going to attract massive funding and private sector attention in 2026. Simultaneously, builders will move away from the hype around humanoid models towards functional robots designed to handle specific tasks and make life easier. The future of robotics will look more like Roomba than your neighbor Rhonda, which actually bodes well from both an affordability and technology risk perspective.

What trend or technology should we be paying more attention to?

We will see massive innovation where AI meets the physical world in 2026 on both the infrastructure and consumer app layers. Combining AI with smart hardware and physical infrastructure will ensure the transformation of trillion-dollar industries from manufacturing to life sciences to food systems. In order for AI to power the future without tanking grids or negatively impacting communities, it must be paired with physical hardware that solves problems and makes everyday life better for people. We’ll benefit as much from an AI smartphone as we will with an AI-powered waste facility.

Kyle Teamey, managing partner at RA Capital Planetary Health

Data centers have dominated conversations about energy in 2025. What should we expect in 2026?

I think data centers will still dominate in 2026. But I guess I’m a little jaded on this stuff because I was in the last AI cycle — it’s a lot of the same conversation. But the level of investment is orders of magnitude greater. The level of attention is orders of magnitude greater. And so it’s going to take a long while for this to shake out one way or another.

The spending for 2026 is already budgeted. The train has left the station. Could a bubble burst in 2026? Sure. But that would take a while to be manifested. It’s going to take months to a year perhaps to to really be manifested. You’d have to shut it off midstream and try to claw your money back. That’s pretty hard to do.

Where is the biggest opportunity to find or place power on the grid?

This has been talked about a lot, but the data use, the requirements for data, it scales fairly exponentially. Power it scales quite linearly. As a consequence, it’s going to take a long while, I think, for the physical world to catch up to the data demand side. It’s really all of the above. If you can if you can do anything in power generation, power storage, transmission, distribution, if you can improve grid operations — the list goes on and on and on.

A bull market in electricity like this, I don’t know how long it’s been, maybe like a century? And so it really, at least to us, it looks like it’s all of the above. Lots and lots of interesting opportunities within that. We’ve seen some companies go public in the like the last 12, 18 months. We probably will see more. I think it’s fair to to think that there will be.

Which climate tech or clean energy startup is most likely to IPO in 2026?

I think power generation is gonna see more public companies in 2026, for sure. There could be a wide, wide variety there. Nuclear everything is in vogue right now. We’ll likely see more of those. Geothermal, we’ll definitely see some of those. And you’ve already got a bunch of interesting players who are in project development and implementation, some of those could go public as well. It’s not just the tech companies, but the folks up and down the value chain.

Which technologies do you think will be ready to deploy at larger scales in 2026?

Nuclear fission companies in particular. That could be a bubble for sure, but if some of these companies start succeeding and start getting uh projects built. Every few years these opportunities pop up, and it makes sense that people take advantage of those opportunities to raise some additional cash and grow more rapidly.

What trend or technology should we be paying more attention to?

There haven’t been any technologies I’ve seen recently where I’m like, ‘Oh wow that’s going to change the world, everyone should be looking at that.’ I do think it is more about scaling for a lot of these right now. If you can hit scale quickly, it’s an amazing opportunity.

If you look at the the various trends, it’s not just the manufacturing demand. The other driver is the regionalization of everything, which is driving demand for labor, for resources. Fill in the blank, there’s demand for it.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/XpmsFQ5xvaYXNWYPv.KLEA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/techcrunch_finance_785/1d051dd99e83a750cbc29efe69f9cd3d,N,,2025-12-30 16:58:28.296657

Solar Holler Founder and CEO Dan Conant said solar may be an option for Mountain State residents who may be looking to use solar power as an energy source for their property ahead of the expiration of the 30 percent federal clean energy tax credit Dec. 31. The recommendation was made as his company continues the installation of dozens of 5-kilowatt solar panel systems designed for residential use, along with larger systems for properties that host nonprofit organizations and commercial businesses ahead of the deadline.

“If folks want to take advantage of that tax credit that covers 30 percent of the costs of the project, it has to be installed this year,” Conant said recently on WAJR’s “Talk of the Town.” “And then next year, it goes away.”

According to Conant, the cost for an installation varies depending on the size of the property, with most 5 kW solar panel systems expected to cost just over $10,000 to fully integrate into an average four-bedroom household. Once everything is installed, homeowners can then incorporate up to 30 percent of the total installation costs of the system towards their federal tax payment. This will also be separate from a new process that residents can take part in where usage of the solar panels can be incorporated into monthly energy bills.

“We actually tie it into the power grid, so when you’re not home and it’s a sunny day, the solar will spin your meter backward,” said Conant. “And then you’ll build up credits that you can apply against your bill.”

Conant said not only is there expected to be a direct cost benefit for individual consumers but also investment in solar panel-based energy sources that directly affects the West Virginia economy.

According to Conant, a wide variety of solar panel pieces of equipment are produced and sold in various parts of the Mountain State. Added with the use of contractors with the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, Solar Holler hopes the immediate investment into an industry that has over 700 people employed across West Virginia will also entice new users alongside the tax credit and energy bill benefits that can be negotiated with service providers.

“A lot of panels from around the country are actually being made out of West Virginia sand, and we’ve got batteries being made up in Weirton, and steel and all kinds of stuff so the solar industry as a whole is construction but also manufacturing.”

The expiration of the federal tax credit is expected to be fully applied at the start of 2026, with the credits for nonprofits, farmers, and commercial businesses allowed to be safe harbored until 2029. The credit for safe harbored projects can only be applied if the solar panel installation is locked in place by the end of this year. With projects taking place in homes all the way to religious centers from as far south as Flatwoods and as far north as Monongalia County, Conant encourages West Virginians to give solar power a shot.

“Depending on what you’re looking for, it can either just be a price hedge to make sure you’re protected from the utility increases, or it can also be a security for power to run,” said Conant. “For power to run the freezer and fridges and everything you need.”

Topline:

The Eaton and Pacific Palisades fires renewed attention to issues such as utility oversight, insurance coverage, and the broader challenges of wildfire planning in a changing climate. But California found pushing its climate agenda forward to be an uphill battle this year: ambitious climate goals faced a hostile federal government economic pressures.

Agenda setbacks: Anticipating opposition from President Donald Trump, state leaders chose to abandon important clean-air rules before he even took office, including plans to phase out diesel trucks and transition to cleaner trains. Nearing mid-year, Trump and his allies in Congress blocked the state’s clean-car mandate, a blow to emissions reduction plans. By the end of the legislative session, these issues converged, as legislators passed a six-bill deal that included a plan to boost oil drilling, relief for ratepayers who fund wildfire mitigation, and an extension of the now rebranded “cap-and-invest” program.

Read on... for more on what 2025 delivered on the climate front.

Days after 2025 began, two fires scorched through Los Angeles neighborhoods, the most destructive in California’s history. The Eaton and Pacific Palisades fires also renewed attention to issues such as utility oversight, insurance coverage, and the broader challenges of wildfire planning in a changing climate. And their harms rippled outward, leaving thousands of low-income workers and immigrants without jobs.

But California found pushing its climate agenda forward to be an uphill battle this year: Ambitious climate goals faced a hostile federal government economic pressures.

Anticipating opposition from President Donald Trump, state leaders chose to abandon important clean-air rules before he even took office, including plans to phase out diesel trucks and transition to cleaner trains. Nearing mid-year, Trump and his allies in Congress blocked the state’s clean-car mandate, a blow to emissions reduction plans.

Nevertheless, as part of budget negotiations, Gov. Gavin Newsom sought to reauthorize California’s landmark cap-and-trade program, launching a debate that would resolve in the final hours of the legislative session.

Blaming climate and environmental regulation, Phillips 66 and Valero followed through on plans to shutter oil refineries, raising concerns about gas prices and the future of the state’s oil industry. In Wilmington, Phillips 66 is now closed. A high-profile explosion at Chevron’s El Segundo refinery nearby underscored persistent safety and environmental risks tied to remaining facilities.

By the end of the legislative session, these issues converged, as legislators passed a six-bill deal that included a plan to boost oil drilling, relief for ratepayers who fund wildfire mitigation, and an extension of the now rebranded “cap-and-invest” program.

As lawmakers passed sweeping reforms to California’s landmark environmental review law, critics warned exemptions may make it easier for potentially high-polluting advanced manufacturing facilities to take root in already vulnerable areas.

Longstanding conflicts over water continued to simmer this year. The governor continued pressing to fast-track a $20 billion tunnel around the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta to send more water south — to the outrage of Delta lawmakers. And dry conditions led to dire projections for the Colorado River, a vital water supply for Southern California. They ramped up the tensions — and the urgency — as negotiators from states that rely on the river tried, and failed, to reach a deal portioning out water supplies.

2026 Outlook

Affordability, the cost of climate adaptation, and pollution harms, in the skies and in the waste stream, continue to be key issues for California. As Gov. Gavin Newsom’s balancing act continues, the state will navigate tensions with environmental justice advocates unhappy with compromises. Emerging risks include the cost – in energy and water – of data centers, and the environmental consequences of the battery economy.

For more than a century, the Rose Parade has delighted audiences across Southern California with its colorful, elaborate floats and fanfare.

The parade will celebrate its 137th year when floats begin traveling through Pasadena at 8 a.m. Jan. 1, 2026. This year's theme is ""Magic in Teamwork,"" and Magic Johnson is the Grand Marshal.

This year, for the first time in two decades, rain appears to be highly likely on parade day. Rain conditions are rare for the legendary parade.

Showing off SoCal weather, in fact, was one of the main drivers of the parade's creation.

As the Pasadena Tournament of Roses website recounts, Charles F. Holder led Valley Hunt Club members in creating the parade in 1890, saying: “In New York, people are buried in snow. Here our flowers are blooming and our oranges are about to bear. Let’s hold a festival to tell the world about our paradise.”

Nearly one year after fires destroyed thousands of homes in L.A. County, many families have concluded that rebuilding isn’t in their budget. In nearly half of recent deals for empty lots, homeowners are selling to investors. That’s the conclusion researchers with the online real estate listings platform Redfin reached in a new report published this morning.

The numbers: Analyzing transactions in L.A. County burn zones during July, August and September, they found that about 40% of Pacific Palisades vacant lots went to corporate buyers. In both Altadena and Malibu, about 44% of such vacant lot sales went to investors.

The context: Investor activity is common following disasters. While some say they can be helpful in bringing homes back to ravaged communities, others are skeptical about their plans. Some lawmakers and organizations have been working to counteract speculative development in Altadena.

Read on… to learn why one Altadena fire survivor sees this trend as “disaster capitalism” coming for the diverse foothill community.

Shortly after the Eaton Fire destroyed thousands of homes in and around Altadena, signs sprung up across the community announcing “Altadena is not for sale.”

Now, nearly one year later, hundreds of Altadena families have concluded that rebuilding isn’t in their budget. In nearly half of recent deals for empty lots, homeowners are selling to investors.

That’s the conclusion researchers with the online real estate listings platform Redfin reached in a new report published Tuesday.

Analyzing transactions in L.A. County burn zones during July, August and September, they found that about 40% of Pacific Palisades vacant lots went to corporate buyers. In both Altadena and Malibu, about 44% of such vacant lot sales went to investors.

“It's not uncommon to see that when disasters hit a place, investors come in,” said Sheharyar Bokhari, Redfin’s principal economist. “It's hard to value a vacant lot, so you could perhaps buy lower than what it should sell for and then flip it.”

More vacant lots are getting scooped up

To conduct the analysis, Redfin researchers looked at sales in the zip codes 90272 for the Pacific Palisades, 91001 for Altadena and 90265 for Malibu. They categorized buyers as investors if their names contained words or abbreviations such as LLC, Inc, Corp or Homes.

There was a marked increase of vacant lots sales in all communities, according to the report. In the Pacific Palisades, 119 lots sold in July, August and September. Altadena saw 61 lot sales. In 2024, before the fires, neither Pacific Palisades nor Altadena had any lots selling in those months.

Malibu saw some vacant lots sell in that time frame in 2024. But before the fires, only about 21% of those sales were to investors.

The findings are similar to those in a separate report published in October by the nonprofit Strategic Actions for a Just Economy. That report found that 49% of sales in the Eaton Fire burn zone went to corporate entities.

Zaire Calvin lost his family’s home in Altadena and had a sister who died in the fire. He said the trend shows “disaster capitalism” poised to change the diverse foothill community.

“If rebuilding becomes a race for capital instead of a return home for families, then disaster has been basically repackaged as opportunity for those with the most resources,” Calvin said. “It's like they're preying on us while we're still praying for hope and help.”

Some lawmakers and organizations have been working to counteract speculative development..

Assembly Bill 851, signed by Gov. Gavin Newsom in October, outlawed unsolicited offers on properties in burn zones until 2027.

The nonprofit Greenline Housing Foundation has been buying lots from distressed sellers in Altadena, giving them an alternative to more bottom-line driven investors. The organization has said it intends to rebuild homes and sell them at below market prices to first-time buyers.

Corporate buyers: disaster capitalists or helpful rebuilders?

Bokhari, the Redfin economist, said investor activity is not entirely detrimental to communities recovering from disaster.

“Investors who have a lot more capital can come in and build that community,” he said. They can afford to clean up lingering environmental damage and build homes that comply with the latest fire safety codes, he said.

“Investors play that role in bringing back those homes,” Bokhari said.

Still, uncertainty around investors’ plans have left many Altadenans anxious. Will homes be for sale or for rent? How will those homes look? Will investor-built properties give Black families a way to continue building generational wealth in a historically Black corner of L.A. County?

Lori Gay, president and CEO of Neighborhood Housing Services of L.A. County, said in the grand scheme of L.A. real estate, not many lots in Altadena are trading hands so far. Only 61 lots in the community sold in July, August and September according to the Redfin report.

“More will go up for sale over time,” Gay said. But in her organization’s work advising families on how to rebuild, she said, “Most families we’ve seen want to go back home. They’re not trying to leave. They’re trying to figure out how to stay.”

The Distributed Wind Energy Futures Study leverages a highly detailed evaluation of more than 150 million U.S. land parcels to enable a high-resolution view of the landscape of opportunity for distributed wind deployment. The study uses NLR's Distributed Wind (dWind) model, a module within the Distributed Generation Market Demand (dGen™) model suite.

To explore this high-resolution dataset, NLR has developed the DW Scenario Analyzer. This tool allows users to explore the key data products of the research. Raw data are published on the DOE Atmosphere to Electrons (A2e) Wind Data Portal. With this portal, county, ZIP code, and U.S. census block group statistics can be downloaded to make custom maps or to conduct user-specific analysis.

An Opportunity for Economic Development

The findings show that the potential for distributed wind energy is considerably higher than previously estimated. We calculate that there are 8,695 GW of distributed wind technical potential for front-of-the-meter applications in the Baseline 2022 scenario and 7,796 GW in the Baseline 2035 scenario, which is, on average, 1.8 times more technical potential in the contiguous United States than previously reported. Similarly, there is, on average, 2.1 times more technical potential for behind-the-meter applications: 1,749 GW in the Baseline 2022 scenario and 3,743 GW in the Baseline 2035 scenario.

The improved model also highlights additional economic potential for behind-the-meter applications. Compared to the estimated 4,000 TWh of electricity consumption in the United States, a substantial fraction of that energy could be generated with distributed wind technology. Taking the most conservative estimates, 2.5% of demand could be satisfied using economic behind-the-meter scenarios, and an additional 78.5% of demand could be satisfied with economic front-of-the-meter scenarios. Additional incentives or net metering regulations (for behind-the-meter scenarios) could allow an even greater potential.

High Potential in Rural and Agricultural Regions

NLR finds the regions with the highest potential for distributed wind tend to have a combination of high-quality wind, relatively high electricity rates for behind-the-meter applications, higher wholesale power rates for front-of-the-meter applications, and siting availability.

The Midwest has the overall highest potential for distributed wind. The Pacific Northwest and Northeast regions have significant potential for expansion of behind-the-meter distributed wind deployments. States with the most near-term potential for behind-the-meter applications include Texas, Minnesota, Montana, Colorado, Indiana, and Oklahoma. States with the most near-term potential for front-of-the-meter applications include Oklahoma, Nebraska, Iowa, Illinois, Kansas, and South Dakota.

In alignment with recent programs from the U.S. Department of Agriculture and DOE, we also note significant existing opportunities for distributed wind generation in agricultural and rural areas: The top 10 states for front-of-the-meter systems have an annual energy production of 1,199 TWh, and the top 10 states for behind-the-meter applications have an annual energy production of 19 TWh. Overall, agricultural land represents 33% of the total distributed wind opportunity for the 2022 behind-the-meter scenario, and 42% for the 2022 front-of-the-meter scenario, indicating that agricultural and rural areas represent the greatest opportunity for distributed wind—more than any other land use type.

South Africa was the largest destination for Chinese solar, but not the only one.

South Africa’s rapid pivot to Chinese solar gear, as affordable as it is, also doesn’t resolve a basic problem.
He then raised money to add solar panels to a charitable school he supports nearby.","Ismet Booley, a dentist in Cape Town, had a serious problem a few years ago. Patients showed up for appointments, only to find the power had gone out.

No power meant no X-rays, no fillings, no root canals. “I just couldn’t work,” Dr. Booley said.

South Africans like Dr. Booley have found a remedy for power cuts that have plagued people in the developing world for years. Thanks to swiftly falling prices of Chinese made solar panels and batteries, they now draw their power from the sun.

These aren’t the tiny, old-school solar lanterns that once powered a lightbulb or TV in rural communities. Today, solar and battery systems are deployed across a variety of businesses — auto factories and wineries, gold mines and shopping malls. And they are changing everyday life, trade and industry in Africa’s biggest economy.

This has happened at startling speed. Solar has risen from almost nothing in 2019 to roughly 10 percent of South Africa’s electricity-generating capacity.

No longer do South Africans depend entirely on giant coal-burning plants that have defined how people worldwide got their electricity for more than a century. That’s forcing the nation’s already beleaguered electric utility to rethink its business as revenues evaporate.

Joel Nana, a project manager with Sustainable Energy Africa, a Cape Town-based organization, called it “a bottom-up movement” to sidestep a generations-old problem. “The broken system is unreliable electricity, expensive electricity or no electricity at all,” he said. “We’ve been living in this situation forever.”

What’s happening in South Africa is repeating across the continent. Key to this shift: China’s ambition to lead the world in clean energy.

Over the past decade, while the United States ramped up fossil fuel exports, China has focused on dominating renewables. Today, Chinese companies make so many of the world’s solar panels, electric vehicles and batteries that they are slashing prices and scrambling to find buyers.

Tariffs have thwarted them somewhat in the United States and Europe, but they’re finding enormous new markets in Africa, where around 600 million people lack reliable electricity. Across the continent, solar imports from China rose 50 percent the first 10 months of 2025, continuing a trend, according to a review of Chinese export data by Ember, a British energy tracking group.

South Africa was the largest destination for Chinese solar, but not the only one. Sierra Leone imported the equivalent of more than half its total current electricity-generating capacity, and Chad, nearly half.

China has much to gain. Not least, new markets and new geopolitical influence. Its companies are doing more than just exporting. State-owned Power China is also building utility-scale solar farms in South Africa, as in other developing economies.

And now China is bidding on contracts from the state-owned utility, Eskom, to add 14,000 kilometers (about 8,700 miles) of transmission lines that South Africa desperately needs to move its increasing supply of solar power around the country.

“Obviously we don’t have money for that,” South Africa’s deputy minister for electricity and energy, Samantha Graham-Maré, said in an interview, referring to the hefty upfront costs of expanding the grid.

Who does? China.

Chinese state-owned companies are among several international firms to bid on South Africa’s $25 billion grid expansion, vying to build the lines and then make money, in part, by operating them. Chinese firms hold similar build-operate contracts in countries including Brazil and the Philippines.

The solar surge does little to address the most pressing social and economic problems of developing countries like South Africa, the need to generate new jobs for millions of young citizens. Installation labor is local, but the panels and batteries are almost all made in China.

“The economic trade-offs are significant,” said Marvellous Ngundu, a researcher with the Institute of Security Studies, a think tank in Pretoria. “Jobs are created elsewhere. South Africa consumes advanced green technologies without capturing the industrial benefits.”

Then there are the security implications of a foreign company running the electricity grid. Asked about this, Ms. Graham-Maré said the outside companies could operate the lines for an unspecified period of time and that the grid as a whole would remain owned and controlled by the state. (In other countries, China’s State Grid owns stakes in national grids.)

Asked about security concerns, she said, “Our grid is very, very safe.”

The Race to Adapt

The rapid shift by so many businesses and people to install their own panels and batteries is causing headaches for Eskom, the already troubled utility.

Every kilowatt generated by privately owned solar installations is a hit to its bottom line. Eskom’s coal-burning plants, which provide most of South Africa’s power, are old and in poor shape.

Power cuts have subsided recently, but it wasn’t long ago that Eskom had to turn off electricity to some areas for hours at a time — a practice called “load shedding” that hurt the economy and fed public anger. During the worst days of load shedding, the latest of which came in early 2024, even Ms. Graham-Maré, the deputy electricity minister, installed a solar system in her home. Her energy bill, she said, fell by two-thirds.

Multiply her hack by the thousands and you have what South Africans call Eskom’s “death spiral.” Well-off customers lower their bills with solar, which causes Eskom to lose money, which in turn forces Eskom to raise prices and encourages more people to install solar.

It doesn’t help that some people tap power lines to draw electricity illegally, without paying for it, or that Eskom has suffered years of mismanagement.

In the past five years alone, South Africans installed solar panels representing more than seven gigawatts, or about a tenth of the total installed capacity of 55 gigawatts. Most is privately owned.

Now, unable to beat solar, Eskom is joining solar.

The utility has removed onerous licensing requirements on private installations. It has allowed people to sell power to the grid. And it has tweaked its rates so that customers pay a fixed charge in addition to the cost of any power they consume. Essentially, people pay simply to be connected to the grid, a standard feature in other nations that’s new in South Africa.

The problem, experts said, is that South Africa lacks policies to require local manufacturing. But creating them would drive up costs. The prices of made-in-China panels are by far the lowest in the world.

South Africa’s rapid pivot to Chinese solar gear, as affordable as it is, also doesn’t resolve a basic problem. The country’s poorest citizens still can’t afford to put up their own panels.

They lack the money to buy the gear outright and the ability to get loans.

In Langa township, one of Cape Town’s largest low-income suburbs, one of the rare businesses with solar is Colin Mkosi’s bicycle delivery service, Cloudy Deliveries. His single panel, donated by a charity, powers a few lights and computers. It doesn’t provide nearly enough to charge the electric bikes his business relies on.

The e-bikes are, of course, from China. But his power still comes from South Africa’s unreliable grid. “It’s expensive,” he said, and “we can’t operate without electricity.”

Mr. Mkosi’s wants are part of a broader problem. South Africa buys growing volumes of high-value technologies from China, while selling it raw materials of limited value. China overtook the U.S. as its biggest trading partner in 2008. With its trade gap rising to more than $9 billion in 2023, compared with barely $1 billion in 2000, there are increasing calls to make trade relations with China less unequal.

The difference between South Africa’s trade ties with China and with the U.S. is stark.

President Trump has imposed a 30 percent tariff on South African goods and excluded the government from participating in an international summit of the world’s 20 biggest economies. He has also reversed a Biden administration plan to help the country accelerate its planned closures of its oldest, dirtiest coal plants.

“As relations with the United States have become increasingly strained, Beijing has positioned itself as a reliable and sympathetic partner,” Dr. Ngundu said.

Sun and Wine

Far from the hand-wringing over trade and geopolitics, in South Africa’s storied wine region of Stellenbosch the sun is as bright as the chardonnay.

Which explains why, on the Lanzerac Wine Estate in December, workers were finishing installation of rows of solar panels between rows of vines. The panels would soon supply all the electricity to run the 54-room luxury hotel on the estate, and the winery’s operations.

Batteries would store power for the night. For only two or three months a year, during winter, would the winery need to buy much electricity from the grid.

He installed a bigger system for his home, and his electricity bills dropped to a fifth of what they were. He then raised money to add solar panels to a charitable school he supports nearby.

One recent evening, as dusk drew in, the lights in his house came on, powered by batteries, and his swimming pool was warm, heated by electricity from his panels. The family sat around a kitchen table, cooing over a grandchild. By next June, he expects his home system will be paid off.

This gives Dr. Booley solace. He’s planning for retirement, and solar has eliminated one of his worries, he said — “that I’ll not be able to afford electricity when I’m a pensioner.”

North Carolina Rate Increase Approved A proposed Duke Energy rate increase has gotten quite a lot of press (Duke is giving that eldest sibling energy).
But the middle child, PSNC Enbridge, has just scored its own rate increase, resulting in no news coverage whatsoever.","We get our heating and cooling from three main types of providers, and sometimes they resemble a trio of siblings. There’s the eldest child — the legacy electric utilities like Duke Energy or Georgia Power. There’s the youngest child — the renewable energy providers that operate at both grid scale and behind the meter (solar, wind, batteries). And then there’s that middle child — the gas local distribution companies (LDCs) like Piedmont Natural Gas and PSNC Enbridge (formerly Dominion). The middle child often flies below the radar and doesn’t attract the attention that the oldest and youngest get. One particular middle child, PSNC Enbridge, has been overlooked in North Carolina. Let’s see what they’ve been up to.

Persistently Over-Estimating Gas Need

The consulting group London Economics International took a look at how PSNC Enbridge estimates how much gas capacity it will need to buy from the big interstate pipeline companies. These estimates determine just how big new pipeline projects are. This is important because these pipeline costs are passed straight to ratepayers, and PSNC Enbridge has no risk and no incentive to look out for you, the ratepayer.

The gas resources PSNC Enbridge needs, called design day demand, are based on what is required to meet the demand of 655,000 customers on the coldest day of the year. LEI found that PSNC Enbridge

Starts with a baseline that is higher than historical data indicates it should be

Uses 70 years of temperature data to find the coldest day, while most LDCs use 40 years of data (inflating design day demand)

Adds another 9% they call a “kick factor” to calculate what would be needed on the coldest day

Consistently overestimates the annual rate of future demand growth

These all add up to PSNC Enbridge contracting for way too much capacity on expensive new interstate pipeline projects. The company has no real incentive to not overestimate the amount of interstate capacity it needs and no incentive to negotiate the best rates for that capacity. All this adds up to higher bills (talk about a “kick factor”).

North Carolina Rate Increase Approved

A proposed Duke Energy rate increase has gotten quite a lot of press (Duke is giving that eldest sibling energy). But the middle child, PSNC Enbridge, has just scored its own rate increase, resulting in no news coverage whatsoever. The North Carolina Utilities Commission gave the middle child an early Christmas present when it approved a rate increase for the gas customers of PSNC Enbridge on December 3.

For residential customers, the rate increase is bigger in the winter than in the summer, right when home gas consumption hits its peak. That’s another unwelcome “kick factor.” PSNC Enbridge calculates that the rate increase will be about 7.2% for residential customers.

Big Profits for Shareholders

PSNC Enbridge is part of the larger Canadian pipeline developer Enbridge Inc. Thanks to all of the new pipeline construction (including the T-15 project in North Carolina), Enbridge just increased its profit projection for 2026 by 4.12% to $14.5 billion. The company also increased its shareholder dividend by 3%.

PSNC Enbridge is building the expansion of the T-15 gas pipeline in Rockingham, Caswell, and Person Counties, a $700 million project to serve two gas plants being built by an “elder sibling” company, Duke Energy. Duke maintains that new data centers are driving demand for electricity, which drives the utility to claim it needs to build new gas plants and thus drives more demand for gas pipelines. But are these data centers being built for the same artificial intelligence boom that is headed for a bust? The head of Google parent Alphabet, Sundar Pichai, spoke to BBC News just last month.

So in sum, the middle child is over-estimating gas needs, contracting for too much expensive interstate pipeline capacity, building expensive pipelines, crediting/blaming AI and data center growth, and running to the NC Utilities Commission for a rate increase (and there will be more to come). Profits from all of these activities funnel up to shareholders while North Carolina billpayers struggle.

It’s time to pay closer attention to these middle children of the energy space – the local gas distribution companies. No more flying under the radar.",https://cleanenergy.org/wp-content/uploads/cropped-sace-favicon-32x32.png,N,,2025-12-30 12:59:19.067563

Moreover, the shifting federal approach to PFAS will likely impact local plans for testing, treatment technology, and public reporting requirements.
Ultimately, 2026 may prove pivotal in determining how Maryland manages PFAS.
The path forward will require coordination across all levels of government to align environmental and public health initiatives with effective, practical solutions.","Ahead of the 2026 Legislative Session, MACo is previewing some of the major issues likely to gain widespread attention amongst the General Assembly. Among them, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) remain one of the most persistent and complex environmental and public health challenges facing local governments throughout the state.

Valued for their industrial, waterproof, and nonstick properties, PFAS are used in thousands of products, from everyday household items such as water bottles, cookware, and carpets to components of modern infrastructure such as metal finishing. These synthetic substances are often called “forever chemicals” because they don’t easily break down in nature. Rather, they accumulate and persist in the environment and living organisms – even humans – for decades, leading to a wide range of serious environmental and health impacts.

With mounting evidence of PFAS-related risks, government officials are moving to reduce public exposure through new policies and regulations. In 2024, the Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) mandated regular PFAS testing at county landfills while the Maryland General Assembly passed the Protecting State Waters From PFAS Pollution Act, which aims to reduce PFAS contamination from industrial sources and strengthen testing and monitoring standards.

As previously reported by MACo, the 2025 Legislative Session featured extensive debate, particularly regarding the chemical’s presence in sewage sludge used as fertilizer. HB 909/SB 732 sought to limit PFAS concentrations in sewage sludge prior to land application, but local governments raised concerns that it shifted responsibility onto local treatment plants — which passively receive PFAS — rather than confronting the sources of contamination.

Other proposals would have required wastewater treatment facilities to massively overhaul their operations, including installing new storage and mitigation technologies. Ultimately, the legislation did not pass in 2025, but it is expected to reemerge in some form during the 2026 session.

Moreover, the shifting federal approach to PFAS will likely impact local plans for testing, treatment technology, and public reporting requirements. A recent press release confirmed that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) will retain existing federal drinking water limits for PFOA and PFOS, two major PFAS compounds, but plans to extend compliance deadlines and offer added flexibility for water systems as they work toward meeting federal standards.

Ultimately, 2026 may prove pivotal in determining how Maryland manages PFAS.

A nuclear reactor is at least a decade away from operation, but Duke Energy is moving forward with a permit process expected to last 18 months.

Duke has not committed to building new nuclear units, the utility emphasized in a news release. But the permit could help reduce delays during licensing and construction if nuclear plans move forward.

“The submittal is part of the company’s strategic, ongoing commitment to thoroughly evaluate new nuclear generation options to reliably meet the growing energy needs of its customers while reducing costs and risks,” according to the release.

“Building new nuclear capacity on existing coal sites makes a lot of sense,” said Jon Sanders, director of the John Locke Foundation’s Center for Food, Power, and Life. “Power infrastructure is already there, so it would yield savings in money as well as time. Permitting and building new nuclear facilities, even small modular ones, take a long time. It’s good for Duke to get the ball rolling early.”

The early site permit application to the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission “is a first for Duke Energy,” the utility explained. It’s a “risk-mitigation strategy” as Duke pursues options for new nuclear energy.

The application covers six “potential” nuclear designs for the site. Four are considered small modular reactor designs. The other two are labeled “non-light-water designs.” The application does not include reactors like the 11 “large light-water” units Duke operates now in North Carolina and South Carolina.

“Nuclear energy has and will continue to play an essential role in powering communities in the Carolinas,” said Kendal Bowman, Duke Energy’s North Carolina president, in the release. “Submitting an early site permit application is an important next step in assessing the potential for small modular reactors at the Belews Creek site.”

The Belews Creek Steam Station opened in 1974 on Belews Lake in Stokes County as a coal-fired power plant. Duke added natural gas to the plant in 2020 and 2021. The plant has an existing capacity of 2,200 megawatts. Current units are scheduled to be shut down in the late 2030s. Repurposing the site would save customers money, Duke said on its website.

The new federal permit application focuses on a 1,000-acre site near the existing steam station.

“We’re taking a strategic approach to new nuclear development that allows us to advance licensing activities while reducing risks and allowing technologies to mature,” said Kelvin Henderson, Duke Energy chief nuclear officer.

Duke describes the ESP process as optional. Federal regulators would resolve environmental and site safety topics “on the front end” of a project and confirm a site’s suitability for nuclear reactors. Having an approved permit could cut the risk of delays if Duke proceeds with plans for nuclear power in Stokes County.

Because the permit is “technology-neutral,” Duke could wait to select a particular type of nuclear reactor later in its development process.

If nuclear plans move forward at Belews Creek, Duke plans to add 600 megawatts of “advanced nuclear” to its system by 2037. The first small modular reactor could be in use in 2036.

A permit would last for 20 years with a possible 20-year renewal.

“Over the next decade and a half, Duke will be closing or converting all of North Carolina’s coal-fired power plants,” said Sanders of the Locke Center for Food, Power, and Life. “The utility will need to replace that generation as well as add more generation for increasing demand. North Carolinians will need the new generation to be at least as reliable as coal, while the dictates of the Carbon Plan law push Duke to lower-emission sources. Nuclear energy checks both those boxes as a zero-emissions source that is also the most reliable option.”

The state’s Carbon Plan law requires Duke to cut down on carbon dioxide emissions in the years ahead.

“Duke’s most recent filing before the North Carolina Utilities Commission shows, among other things, how much new solar, natural gas, and nuclear capacity the utility wishes to build in North Carolina by 2040,” Sanders explained. “It also shows how much productivity it expects from those sources.”

“The differences between solar and nuclear in both those measures are stark,” Sanders added. “For one, Duke expects to build more than four times more new capacity in solar than it does in nuclear. Nevertheless, Duke expects to receive nearly four times as much productivity from that new nuclear capacity than from the new solar. Getting more nuclear on the grid is crucial to ensuring reliable electricity in the coming years.”",https://www.carolinajournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/light-switch-scaled.jpeg,N,,2025-12-30 18:58:03.386088

CHARLESTON — Gov. Patrick Morrisey set a goal nearly six months ago for West Virginia to triple its electric-generating capacity, but the comprehensive plan is still in the works with a public comment period now closed.

The West Virginia Office of Energy sought public comment and recommendations as it works on developing a comprehensive energy policy around Morrisey’s 50 by 50 energy initiative. The public comment period opened on Dec. 9 and closed last Friday. According to the office, 71 public comments were submitted by Friday’s deadline.

During speeches in August in White Sulphur Springs and Wheeling, Morrisey unveiled his 50 by 50 initiative aimed at increasing base load electric generating capacity in the state from just under 16 gigawatts to 50 gigawatts by 2050.

“This 50 by 50, that’s a needle mover,” Morrisey said during an end-of-the-year press conference last Monday. “West Virginia needs to be America’s energy state … and to really be a driver of America’s energy renaissance.”

According to the solicitation for public comments, the Office of Energy said Morrisey’s 50 by 50 initiative will be an all-of-the-above energy, focused on traditional fossil fuel sources (coal, natural gas), and also include nuclear energy, hydrogen power, and renewable energy sources (wind, solar, geothermal, hydroelectric). The comprehensive energy policy being developed around 50 by 50 will also include a transmission plan.

“It will address the need for sufficient electricity transmission lines and natural gas transmission pipelines to support the increase in baseload electricity generation,” according to the Office of Energy’s solicitation for public comment. “It will also recommend locations for the placement of natural gas pipelines and electricity transmission lines in locations throughout the state that lack sufficient access and in areas where access to increased supplies of electricity or natural gas will spur manufacturing or other economic development.”

The comprehensive energy policy will include an energy security plan in order to protect against blackouts and other disruptions, and prevent potential threats to the electrical grid, such as cyber-attacks. This plan will include inventories of energy sources in the state and critical infrastructure; developing emergency protocols and coordination plans between local, state and federal agencies; and conducting tabletop exercises and other scenario planning.

The comprehensive energy policy will also include 25-year strategic development for each source of energy in West Virginia. These plans will focus on expanding electrical generation, infrastructure expansions, economic development incentives, site development, legislation and rule-making, workforce development, education, financial and tax incentives, safety, environmental mitigation, and energy security.

Since October, there have been several natural gas power plant projects announced that would add an additional five gigawatts to what is produced by the state’s power plants, including projects announced by FirstEnergy and a partnership between Kindle Energy, GE Vernova, Blackstone, and Wolf Summit Energy.

Morrisey’s 50 by 50 initiative and the comprehensive energy policy being developed by the Office of Energy is focused on making West Virginia the battery of the east coast and making the state more appealing to energy-intensive data center and AI projects.

House Bill 2014, a new law first proposed by Morrisey, is aimed at attracting high-impact industrial businesses and data centers to West Virginia along with microgrids to power the data centers using both fossil fuels and renewable energy generation. The rules governing these new data center and microgrid districts are still awaiting approval from the Legislature, with the Legislative Rule-Making Review Committee slated to review these proposed rules next month.

“We’re going to be leveraging the intersection between energy and technology,” Morrisey said last week. “We’re excited about that and we’re going to keep going. We’re working on finalizing those plans. That’s been a big, big project.”

West Virginia only has one natural gas-fired power plant that provides electricity to retail customers in the PJM market, a regional electric transmission organization that operates a competitive wholesale electricity market in the northeast. West Virginia is one of 12 states and Washington, D.C., which are part of PJM.

The state has nine coal-fired power plants, with coal-fired power accounting for 86% of West Virginia’s total electricity net generation. In its public comment filing, the West Virginia Coal Association argued that existing coal-fired power plants should be prioritized as the foundational assets of the state’s power grid to ensure reliability and economic stability.

“West Virginia’s nine existing coal-fired power plants represent ‘premium assets’ in this age of increased power demand and should serve as the fundamental building block of any plan to increase generation within the State of West Virginia,” wrote West Virginia Coal Association President Chris Hamilton.

In its public comments, the West Virginia Chamber of Commerce advocated for a free-market approach that balances environmental stewardship with the practical needs of the state’s business community. The chamber expressed strong support for a diversified power generation strategy that utilizes both traditional fossil fuels and renewable resources to ensure grid reliability.

“The chamber applauds the goal of the plan to develop new generation capacity utilizing a combination of natural gas, nuclear, coal, geothermal, solar, and wind,” wrote West Virginia Chamber of Commerce President Steve Roberts. “The resource rich opportunities that West Virginia has need to be harnessed for growth of the state’s economy for the benefit of all its citizens.”

West Virginians for Energy Freedom, a coalition of groups that advocate for electric ratepayers, submitted public comments calling for any comprehensive energy policy to prioritize consumer autonomy and protections that protect ratepayers for bearing the financial costs for expanding electric generation. The group called for allowing ratepayers to purchase power from nearby customers, use of plug-in solar systems, and removing caps on net metering solar credit programs.

“Without taking a position on the wisdom of tripling energy capacity in 25 years, we caution that, if West Virginia ratepayers or taxpayers would be required to pay for any of power plants built under this plan, there be guarantees and protections in place to ensure that the plants will be useful and beneficial for West Virginians,” the organization wrote.",https://ogden_images.s3.amazonaws.com/www.theintelligencer.net/images/2025/12/29234026/Power-Plant-12-29-25-667x500.jpg,N,,2025-12-30 16:58:31.582116

Hundreds of residents and local officials have expressed concerns about property values, environmental impact and potential costs to ratepayers.

The Public Service Commission of Wisconsin is expected to make a decision on the project and its route in the spring of 2026.

Heidi and Michael Prodoehl felt lucky to find their forever home in rural West Bend.

Out their dining room window, they can see a thick line of trees, an open field and a small wooden playground in their backyard. In the Prodoehls' 13 years living there, they have had two children, started a garden and planted about 300 trees on the property, as well as around the surrounding prairie. Their children ride bikes along a dirt path in the woods, where an old maple towers above them. They marvel at passing turkey and deer. Mike said they spend almost all their days off outside.

Since moving there, they’ve found a quiet, natural escape from the Milwaukee suburbs. But they are sick with worry it could all be lost if a proposed power line cuts through their land.

“It’s like losing a limb,"" Mike said. ""They’re just cutting off a whole part of what we had.""

The proposed power line is part of a $1.6 billion American Transmission Co. project spanning several Wisconsin counties to provide power for a sprawling, $15 billion artificial intelligence data center campus for tech companies Vantage, Oracle and OpenAI in nearby Port Washington.

ATC's proposal filings do not explicitly identify the data center, but they do say the power lines are needed ""to reliably serve a load interconnection request by We Energies to serve a new large load addition in the Port Washington area.""

The Waukesha-based power line company's plans include building around 100 miles of high-voltage lines, upgrading existing ones and constructing up to five new substations across Ozaukee, Washington, Fond du Lac, Calumet, Sheboygan and Manitowoc counties, according to ATC's proposal, which includes thousands of pages the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reviewed.

ATC is a subsidiary of the WEC Energy Group, the parent company of We Energies. The proposal was submitted in September 2025 to Wisconsin's Public Service Commission, a state agency that oversees utility companies and approves new projects.

ATC's application proposes two options for the power line routes.

The company's preferred route (which would run through the Prodoehl family's land) would be 11 miles shorter, run near fewer homes and be less expensive, costing $1.4 billion, which is appealing to those with concerns that regular energy ratepayers will foot the bill for these power lines.

The alternative route would be longer and costlier at $1.6 billion, but it would run by fewer farms, build more upon existing lines and disrupt fewer natural spaces; it's garnered endorsements from local elected officials and, most recently, the data center's development company, Vantage.

Proposed power lines are tied to data center campus project in Port Washington

Since the data center project was announced in January 2025, word about the power line proposal has spread. In February, some homeowners and businesses along the proposed routes told the Journal Sentinel they'd received letters from ATC, and many expressed concerns that the lines would slice through their communities and disrupt their natural spaces.

Over the last several months, many of these residents have collectively submitted over 500 complaints to ATC, detailing their concerns about the potential impact on homes, businesses, farmland, the environment and recognized cultural or historical sites, as well as frustrations about bearing the burden of infrastructure intended to support a few private companies.

Many have also directed concerns toward the companies behind the data center campus project driving energy demand for the new lines, as well as the local officials paving the way to approve it. They've joined the growing group of regional residents voicing opposition to the data center project at local city meetings.

Meanwhile, the data center project's supporters, including many southeast Wisconsin business leaders and trade groups, emphasize the data center companies' promises that the project will create jobs, improve the region's grid for all users, add over $2.7 billion to the area's gross domestic product and position Wisconsin at the forefront of a technological revolution that cannot be stopped.

Without the new power lines, the grid would not be able to support the new data center, according to ATC's application.

ATC's proposed power line project would meet 'substantial' energy needs of data center project, which would otherwise overwhelm Wisconsin's grid

If fully built out, the data center campus could be one of the largest in the country with committed capacity from a utility. But even the first phase of development, with its four data center buildings and around 1.3 gigawatts, will require a significant amount of new energy infrastructure.

The amount of energy needed to power the center is ""substantial and [the proposed energy load addition] would be one of the largest in Wisconsin,"" ATC's application says.

Without the proposed 138- and 345-kilovolt power lines and substations, the flurry of new energy projects for the data center campus would overwhelm parts of Wisconsin's grid, according to the application.

Power line project spans six counties, including dozens of farms, hundreds of homes and several natural spaces

The price tags of both the $1.4 billion preferred and a $1.6 billion alternative routes include the costs of building at least four new substations, totaling between 94 and 104 acres:

A 40-acre Decker Substation in Port Washington

An 18-acre Sheboygan River Substation in the Town of Osceola

A 16-acre Mullet River Junction Substation in the Town of Lima

A 20-acre Cedar Creek Junction Substation in the Town of Jackson

A 10-acre Adell Substation in the Town of Sherman (if the alternative route is chosen)

The routes span farmland, pastureland, grasslands and wetlands, as well as residential, commercial, industrial and public areas across six different counties: Calumet, Fond du Lac, Ozaukee, Manitowoc, Sheboygan and Washington.

The preferred route runs alongside roughly 110 animal farms, including nearly 50 dairy farms. The alternate route runs alongside roughly 80 animal farms, including nearly 40 dairy farms, according to the proposal.

The preferred route would run within at least 300 feet of 128 homes and two apartment buildings. The alternate route would run by 226 homes and 16 apartment buildings within that same distance.

The preferred route would run by roughly 1,391 acres of wetlands. The alternative would run by about 886 acres of wetlands.

The preferred route would cross over portions of the Fox River State Trail, Nichols Creek Wildlife Area, Stony Creek River corridor, Sheboygan County Waterfowl Production Area and Gough Lake north of Cedarburg Bog. The alternate route would cross over portions of Brillion Wildlife Area, Kettle Moraine State Forest, Mullet Creek Wildlife Area, Quade Park and Cedarburg Bog Natural Area.

The two routes would also cross through areas of archaeological, historical and ecological significance, including indigenous burial mounds, though most of the information in the application about these sites is redacted in the public-facing filings.

Asked about the redactions, ATC said they largely covered locations of rare species, known burial sites or archaeological artifacts, which is kept confidential to prevent tampering.

Some costs for power lines and substations, along with other new power plant projects, could eventually fall on customers

Executive Director of the utilities watchdog Citizens Utility Board Tom Content said ATC's proposal is the biggest project he's ever heard of just to plug one customer into Wisconsin's grid.

Citizens Utility Board has been advocating to protect regular energy customers from the massive scale of costs for new power plants and power lines in the PSC pipeline to support data centers.

When the Journal Sentinel asked ATC how the power lines would be financed, the company indicated that an unspecified portion of the costs could be spread across all electricity customers in the state over time.

ATC does not bill large energy and infrastructure beneficiaries like data center developer Vantage. Instead, ATC said it bills local distribution company customers, like We Energies and other utilities, as is established under a federal tariff that regulates transmission companies.

We Energies and other local distributors then pass those costs on to their own customers, ATC said.

In March 2025, We Energies proposed a new electric rate for data center companies, where those companies would cover 75% of the costs for nearly $6 billion in new power plants serving data centers.

That proposal also includes a ""transmission service charge,"" which would allow We Energies to pass some costs to data center companies, but the application is murky about how much data centers would actually pay.

This is a big question mark for energy consumer advocates, Content said. ""We're very concerned about the transmission cost piece of this.""

For residents, property and environmental impacts are among the top concerns, along with stray voltage, historical sites, farmland and the data center

Included in ATC's application documents are hundreds of pages of survey responses and emails from residents along the proposed route, expressing concerns about either parts of the routes or the entire project.

A total of 511 people sent feedback to ATC during late August and early September 2025, according to a Journal Sentinel analysis. The survey responses do not include around 509 people who signed three separate petitions opposing the power lines, which were also submitted to ATC.

85% said they had concerns about the project's potential impact to their property, including their business and home values.

74% had concerns about potential impacts to the environment, natural resources and wildlife.

24% expressed concerns about health and safety, especially regarding stray voltage or the impact of electromagnetic fields on humans or cattle.

20% expressed concern about the impact on important cultural and historical sites.

16% expressed explicit opposition to the data center campus in Port Washington driving demand for the proposed power lines.

13% were concerned about the proposed lines' intrusion onto farming and agricultural land.

10% were concerned about the potential impact on the grid's reliability or their energy costs.

Asked about the top concerns in the analysis, ATC said the company's public engagement efforts, including six open house sessions and four informational mailings, helped inform its proposal. The company also said, moving forward, it would respond to additional feedback on its application as needed.

In its application, ATC said its proposal strives for minimal impact to existing homes, schools, places of worship, cemeteries, natural spaces and areas used for cultural, historical, archaeological, recreational, economic, transportation and agricultural purposes.

Dairy farmers near the proposed routes express concerns over stray voltage

Jason Vorpahl is the co-owner and CEO of Rockland Dairy, which owns 5,000 acres of farmland in Random Lake and Saukville. The two farms have 3,600 dairy cows and produce 300,000 pounds of milk each day.

In a letter to ATC, Vorpahl said cows at the farm struggled with electrical currents and stray voltage before a substation 1 mile away from was removed in 2007. Electromagnetic fields arise from the flow of electricity through the power line and decrease as you move farther from the line, according to ATC.

“Prior to 2007, our cows did not perform well,"" Vorpahl said. ""They did not drink water well, did not eat well, did not milk well, had thin sores on their feet, did not breed and get pregnant well and had many metabolic issues.”

He said those issues disappeared when the substation was removed. Those improvements are now threatened by the proposed lines being too close to the dairy farms, especially the one in Saukville, he said.

""If that power line goes through, we will be done milking cows there,"" Vorpahl said.

Dozens of other dairy farmers who sent feedback to ATC also said they've noticed health and performance issues with their cows near substations or power lines.

Venture Dairy Cooperative, a Wisconsin dairy farmers advocacy group, also sent a letter to ATC saying the group was ""gravely concerned"" the project would pose a ""serious risk to the viability of our farms.""

Residents are concerned about the natural and cultural areas that the proposed lines and substations would run through ‒ and unfairness

Tom Stolp, executive director of Restoring Lands, a nature preservation land trust, said the routes could ""negatively and irreversibly"" affect some of the trust's 7,500 acres of protected land, including 30 community nature preserves and conservation easement holdings.

The preferred route especially would cut directly through lands intentionally protected for the public's benefit – protections paid for with millions of dollars in philanthropy and public investment, Stolp said.

In an interview with the Journal Sentinel, Cheryl Nenn, who works for the environmental advocacy nonprofit Milwaukee Riverkeeper, said the group is concerned about transmission line construction cutting through vegetation near streams and creeks, such as Cedar Creek, the Milwaukee River and the Sheboygan River.

Cooler temperatures found in the north branch of the Milwaukee River watershed are critical for trout spawning and trout populations are of great concern, Nenn said. Clearing trees for the lines would likely raise temperatures in those already warming waterways.

“Losing shade is not going to help that situation,” Nenn said.

Several respondents said they moved into their homes to get away from existing or new power lines near previous homes, including Saukville resident Suzanne Szucs, who left her home in the City of Milwaukee three years ago to escape power lines.

""I only want to see nature and trees outside my windows,"" Szucs wrote in her feedback statement. ""I want to enjoy the property we purchased alongside the neighboring properties that brought us out here in the first place ‒ unmarred.""

Others said it's unfair that people in municipalities far from the data center in Port Washington will have to face the scale of infrastructure costs.

Port Washington residents Ann and Kim Pemble wrote in their feedback statement, ""It is unconscionable that any of us in the proposed study zone would have to bear the burden of the transmission lines when all potential benefit will accrue solely to the city of Port Washington.""

""The entire data center project is for a multibillion dollar company. It is not a public project in any way, shape or form,"" the Pembles said.

Many respondents formed their own groups to oppose the power lines, including the Responsible Energy Alliance, consisting of residents from Saukville, Trenton, Fredonia and Farmington. Two different factions of the alliance, Advocates for Responsible Power and the Protect Fredonia Coalition, have already filed notices of intervention to the PSC.

Separately, the Wisconsin Institute for Law and Liberty publicly threatened legal action against any potential uses of eminent domain for the project on behalf of local landowners and artists Tom and Mary Uttech. The proposed routes would run through the family’s scenic property in Saukville, which is protected by a conservation easement and inspires many of Tom's nationally renowned paintings.

Local officials have also weighed in

The Saukville and Fredonia town boards separately passed resolutions opposing the proposed routes through their communities on Aug. 27 and Sept. 10, respectively.

Washington County's Board of Supervisors also unanimously passed a resolution opposing new power line infrastructure proposed in the county. County Executive Josh Schoemann sent a letter to ATC expressing significant concerns about the proposed routes after the county held several public listening sessions.

Port Washington Mayor Ted Neitzke and the city's common council issued a proclamation urging the PSC to approve the alternative route, which Neitzke said builds more upon lines and infrastructure that already exist.

""The preferred route impacts some of the most pristine and rural areas of our county and I do not want that area to be impacted,"" Neitzke said in a letter to the PSC.

A spokesperson for State Sen. Jodi Habush Sinykin, who represents parts of Ozaukee County, told the Journal Sentinel that she also plans to advocate for the alternative route during the PSC's public comment period. State Rep. Rob Brooks, who represents parts of Ozaukee and Washington counties, also signaled support for the alternative route.

At the City of Port Washington's Dec. 16 common council meeting, a representative of the data center developer Vantage voiced support the alternative route.

A public comment period before the Public Service Commission has not been scheduled. A decision is expected in spring 2026.

ATC expects the Public Service Commission to issue a decision on whether to approve the application and which route to choose during the spring of 2026. If approved, construction would begin May 2026 for completion by December 2027, shortly before the first phase of the data center is set to go online.

A public comment period will take place during which people can weigh in on the project during public hearings. Those dates have not been announced, but ATC has suggested the week of Week of April 13, 2026.

In addition to the Public Service Commission's approval, the transmission line company will need numerous permits and approvals from local, state and federal agencies, including the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection, the Wisconsin Historical Society, and the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, according to the application.
